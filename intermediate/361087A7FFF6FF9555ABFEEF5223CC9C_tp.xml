Summary description
. Sponges are massive, erect club-shaped to lobate, or encrusting, with coarsely spinous surface. Color in life brownish yellow. On deck, the sponge becomes slimy and looses much of its organic tissue quickly, leaving a macerated skeleton of coarse spongin fibres. The consistency is compressible in life, but becomes rigid in preservation. Size of specimens up to 30 x 5 x 
4 cm
. The skeletal framework of the sponge is made up of coarse thick spongin fibres usually entirely filled with thin, vestigial mycalostyles. Foreign materials including sand grains or algal strands occurs in some of the fibres in some of the specimens but this is uncommon generally. The main fibres, with thickness varying from 
100 µm
to 
1 mm
depending on position in the sponge (thicker specimens have basal fibres much thicker than peripheral fibres) may be irregularly anastomosing by connecting thinner fibres (
100–250 µm
diameter). Surface skeleton is absent. Spicules mycalostyles, microscleres rare or absent. Mycalostyles, typically ‘hollow’, reduced in silica development, almost vestigial, with faintly swollen tyles often grooved or lobed, length variable, 104–280 x 
1–7 µm
. Anisochelae not found in tropical localities but two anisochelae of 
19–23 µm
were found in one of Wiedenmayer’s specimens from South East 
Australia
. Sigmas, only rarely observed, absent in tropical localities. Wiedenmayer found 8 sigmas in one of his specimens from South East 
Australia
, thin, widely curved, with apices somewhat incurved, size 
42–86 µm
.

Comments
. Differences with 
Red Sea
specimens, here assigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>Mycale (Arenochalina) tenuispiculata ( Dendy, 1905 )</tp:taxon-name>
are the color, which is cited as yellowish cream to beige in North Australian, and red in 
Red Sea
specimens. Mycalostyles in North Australian specimens appear distinctly thicker (
2–8 µm
) than in 
Red Sea
specimens (
1–3.5 µm
). Of the synonymy designations made by 
<xref rid="ref138732">Wiedenmayer (1989)</xref>
, we disagree with 
<tp:taxon-name>M. (Ar.) imperfecta Baer, 1906</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. (A.) fistulata Hentschel, 1911</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. (Ar.) tylostrongyla Pulitzer-Finali, 1982b</tp:taxon-name>
, as these were reassigned above to the synonymy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Mycale (Arenochalina) imperfecta</tp:taxon-name>
. This species is purple in color and has abundant microscleres, including rosettes of anisochelae.

<xref rid="ref138732">Wiedenmayer (1989)</xref>
also suggested 
<tp:taxon-name>Gelliodes setosa Keller, 1889</tp:taxon-name>
was a junior synonym of the present species. However, his reason for suggesting this comes from 
<xref rid="ref137151">Van Soest’s (1984)</xref>
discussion of the affinities of Caribbean 
<tp:taxon-name>Mycale laxissima ( Duchassaing &amp; Michelotti, 1864 )</tp:taxon-name>
, in which he suggested that Indonesian specimen ZMA Por. 01611 showed similarities with 
<tp:taxon-name>M. laxissima</tp:taxon-name>
. The ZMA specimen was identified by M. Burton as 
<tp:taxon-name>Mycale setosa ( Keller, 1889 )</tp:taxon-name>
, but here it is reassigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>Mycale (Arenochalina) imperfecta</tp:taxon-name>
(cf. above). The name was also used by 
<xref rid="ref131467">
Erpenbeck 
et al.
(2016
</xref>
, supplementary data, CO1tree). Burton’s identification (and Van Soest’s remark) does not conform to the 
type
of 
<tp:taxon-name>Gelliodes setosa</tp:taxon-name>
as described by 
<xref rid="ref133010">Keller (1889)</xref>
, a.o. because no anisochelae were mentioned by Keller. As stated above, we examined the 
type
ZMB 270, which conforms to 
<tp:taxon-name>Gelliodes</tp:taxon-name>
.

<xref rid="ref138732">Wiedenmayer (1989)</xref>
did not include South Australian 
<tp:taxon-name>Esperella crassa Dendy, 1896</tp:taxon-name>
in his long list of assumed junior synonyms of the present species, perhaps because Dendy mentions the presence of small anisochelae of 
16 µm
. Other features, including a strong presence of sand and foreign material do suggest it could be a junior synonym. Likewise, 
<tp:taxon-name>Esperella rara Dendy, 1896</tp:taxon-name>
with the same sandy skeleton and small anisochelae, but in addition also trichodragmas, appears close if not conspecific with the present species. Both are technically outside our target region, so we refrain from giving summary descriptions. Of the latter species the 
type
material appears to have been lost (

<p>
Our estimate for the global diversity of the subgenus is severely uncertain, due to the unsatisfactory state of morphological evidence for species distinction. We believe a rational number of species is approximately 15, but this is not much better than a ‘guess’. One of the vexing problems is the poor knowledge of several South East Australian ‘species’ alleged or suspected to belong to the subgenus. The global distribution of the numbers of species found in Marine Ecoregions (cf. 
<xref rid="ref136201">
Spalding 
et al.
2007
</xref>
) is presented in 
<xref rid="fig-52--151-250-1898-1922-">Fig. 32</xref>
, showing that the subgenus is absent in polar regions and most temperate waters. Its absence in the Mediterranean indicates it has a circum-tropical distribution with a likely South East Pacific origin.
