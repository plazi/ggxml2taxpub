<p>CONTEXT</p>
<p>
In 1789, Aiton published a new 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubus</tp:taxon-name>
species which grew in Kew Gardens under the name 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubus villosus ( Aiton 1789: 210 )</tp:taxon-name>
. Actually, it was Solander who originally catalogued and gave the name to this 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubus</tp:taxon-name>
and Aiton who published it (
<xref rid="ref16729">Blanchard 1911: 431</xref>
; 
<xref rid="ref18920">Stafleu &amp; Cowan 1976: 25</xref>
). A specimen of it has been conserved in the herbarium of the British Museum. 
<xref rid="ref16205">Bailey (1923: 166)</xref>
selected it as the 
type
and provided drawings of it in 
<xref rid="ref16166">Bailey (1898: 372)</xref>
and a photo in 
<xref rid="ref16205">Bailey (1923: 166)</xref>
. It is presently conserved asBM000583294. So, fortunately there is a 
type
specimen to help to clarify its identity. Nevertheless, the history of this name and its various interpretations over time are complex.
</p>
<p>J. F. GMELIN</p>
<p>
Soon after Aiton’s publication of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus , Gmelin (1791)</tp:taxon-name>
noted that the epithet was already used by Thunberg (in 
<xref rid="ref18369">Murray 1784: 475</xref>
) for a species from 
Japan
. Therein, Thunberg speculated whether 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus Thunb.</tp:taxon-name>
might be identical with 
<tp:taxon-name>R. corchorifolius</tp:taxon-name>
L. f. (
<xref rid="ref18080">Linnaeus 1781: 263</xref>
), but this does not make his name invalid (ICN, 
<xref rid="ref19323">
Turland 
et al.
2018
</xref>
: art. 36.1, last sentence), even now that it is generally accepted that they are indeed identical. Consequently, 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus Aiton</tp:taxon-name>
is a later homonym and thus illegitimate. Realizing this, Gmelin proposed a new name for 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus Aiton</tp:taxon-name>
: 
<tp:taxon-name>R. serratus J.F. Gmel. ( Gmelin 1791: 856 )</tp:taxon-name>
. Though this publication was well known, it did not play a significant role in the various debates about 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus Aiton. Bailey (1944: 521)</tp:taxon-name>
even stated that the identity of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus</tp:taxon-name>
was irrelevant because it is an illegitimate name, while failing to account for its legitimate replacement. In the index of the volume of the 13TH edition of the 
Systema Naturae
, 
<xref rid="ref17642">Gmelin (1792: 1616)</xref>
failed to mention the name 
<tp:taxon-name>R. serratus</tp:taxon-name>
, but instead used 
<tp:taxon-name>R. erectus</tp:taxon-name>
. It is unclear why Gmelin did so; this created a new, illegitimate synonym for 
<tp:taxon-name>R. serratus</tp:taxon-name>
if it was not a mere error.
</p>
<p>
There also exists a later homonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. serratus J.F. Gmel.</tp:taxon-name>
: 
<tp:taxon-name>R. serratus Boul. &amp; Letendre</tp:taxon-name>
in 
<xref rid="ref16796">Boulay (1873</xref>
: no. 5), which is a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. winteri (P.J. Müll. ex Focke) Foerster (1878: 100)</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
<p>PORTER &amp; BAILEY</p>
<p>
Nineteenth-century authors generally used the name 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus Aiton</tp:taxon-name>
for the highbush blackberry common in the eastern parts of North America.They neglected both Thunberg’s earlier homonym and also the legitimate name, 
<tp:taxon-name>R. serratus J.F. Gmel.</tp:taxon-name>
</p>
<p>
Near the close of the 19TH century, 
<xref rid="ref18495">Porter (1890: 15)</xref>
made new investigations into this taxon and concluded that it consisted of two distinct varieties: alongside the lowland 
<tp:taxon-name>var. villosus</tp:taxon-name>
, he acknowledged a 
<tp:taxon-name>var. montanus</tp:taxon-name>
from mountainous regions. He elevated the latter to the species level some years later as 
<tp:taxon-name>R. montanus (Porter) Porter (1894: 120)</tp:taxon-name>
. When he discovered that the epithet 
<tp:taxon-name>montanus</tp:taxon-name>
had already been used for a European species, he renamed his species to 
<tp:taxon-name>R. allegheniensis ( Porter 1896: 153 )</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
<p>
Bailey started his critical work on 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubus</tp:taxon-name>
in earnest only a few years later. Soon he discovered that 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus</tp:taxon-name>
was not identical with the taxon for which the name had widely been used, the highbush blackberry (
<xref rid="ref16166">Bailey 1898: 366</xref>
, 367). Therefore, the latter was in need of a new name, and Bailey chose for it 
<tp:taxon-name>R. nigrobaccus L.H. Bailey (1898: 379</tp:taxon-name>
; 
type
: see below under 
<tp:taxon-name>R. sativus</tp:taxon-name>
[L.H. Bailey] Clark). After further research, he concluded that 
<xref rid="ref18573">Porter’s (1896)</xref>
division of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus</tp:taxon-name>
into two species was not tenable (
<xref rid="ref16205">Bailey 1923: 185</xref>
). The mountain form, 
<tp:taxon-name>R. allegheniensis</tp:taxon-name>
, was only a habitat modification of the lowland form, 
<tp:taxon-name>R. nigrobaccus</tp:taxon-name>
(heterotypic synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus</tp:taxon-name>
auct. non Aiton). Joining both taxa to one species, he treated them from that point forward as 
<tp:taxon-name>R. allegheniensis Porter</tp:taxon-name>
, as it was the oldest legitimate name in his view.
</p>
<p>
It is this name that came into common use in the 20 
TH
century up until now for one of the most common brambles of the eastern and central United States and eastern Canada. 
<xref rid="ref16239">Bailey (1925: 288)</xref>
indicated a provisional 
type
: “ 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubus villosus , Ait.</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>var. montanus</tp:taxon-name>
, mihi Pocono Summit. Monroe Co, Penns. Aug. 15/89” 
NY
(
NYBG 5990
) (iso-, PH[
PH
00040760]). 
Later
, this 
type
was formally confirmed byBailey (1944: 522).
</p>
<p>
THE IDENTITY OF 
<tp:taxon-name>R. VILLOSUS AITON</tp:taxon-name>
</p>
<p>
Though it was clear to Bailey that 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus Aiton</tp:taxon-name>
was not identical with 
<tp:taxon-name>R. allegheniensis</tp:taxon-name>
, it was not easy to connect it to any of the known North American species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubus</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<xref rid="ref16166">Bailey (1898: 339)</xref>
initially thought it was identical with 
<tp:taxon-name>R. flagellaris Willd.</tp:taxon-name>
(at that time, incorrectly called 
<tp:taxon-name>R. canadensis</tp:taxon-name>
L., until Bailey’s discovery, after checking the 
type
of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. canadensis</tp:taxon-name>
, that 
<tp:taxon-name>R. canadensis</tp:taxon-name>
is a totally different species; see 
<xref rid="ref16321">Bailey 1943: 243</xref>
; 
<xref rid="ref16357">1944: 473-475</xref>
). 
<xref rid="ref16765">Brainerd (1900: 25</xref>
, 27) followed him in this initial interpretation, and Blanchard was also initially of this opinion (1906a: 148). 
<xref rid="ref18735">Rydberg (1913: 472</xref>
; 
<xref rid="ref18760">1915: 149</xref>
) thought 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus</tp:taxon-name>
to be identical with 
<tp:taxon-name>R. plicatifolius Blanchard (1906a: 149)</tp:taxon-name>
, which Bailey later (1923: 167) supported with some hesitation. Later, 
<xref rid="ref16357">Bailey (1944: 521)</xref>
again supposed this identification might be right but was uncertain.

<p>
After our examination of Bailey’s 
lectotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus Aiton</tp:taxon-name>
, nine characters turned out to be critical for its identification:
</p>
<p>a. The cane prickles are very weak.</p>
<p>
b. The stem looks like a trailer, as 
<xref rid="ref16166">Bailey (1898: 373</xref>
; 
<xref rid="ref16357">1944: 521</xref>
) already noted.
</p>
<p>
c. The stems are only 
2 mm
wide, even the mature floricane.
</p>
<p>
d. The leaves are very small; the largest terminal leaflet is only 3.7 × 
2.4 cm
.
</p>
<p>
e. The leaves are broader than it seems at first sight. The margins are folded so that the bases look cuneate. The original shape of the best terminal leaflet was restored by projecting the folded margin outward. By doing so, an almost elliptical leaflet appears (
<xref rid="fig-5--132-143-1253-1270-">Fig. 1</xref>
).
</p>
<p>f. The leaves are slightly hairy adaxially and rather hairy abaxially, though less than might seem from the unexpanded leaves at the tip of the primocane.</p>
<p>g. The inflorescence has only one flower. Of course, this could be due to unfavorable growing conditions or collecting an atypical inflorescence, but it should be accounted for in combination with the other characteristics.</p>
<p>h. The pedicels have some short, stipitate glands.</p>
<p>i. The ovaries are provided with hairs like the rest of the plant.</p>
<p>Mr.Fred Rumsey(BM)kindly checked the last two characteristics.</p>
<p>
The combination of a-d excludes species of the highbush blackberries of the 
Canadenses
(L.H. Bailey) L.H. Bailey, 
Arguti
(Rydb.) L.H. Bailey, and 
Alleghenienses
(L.H.Bailey)L.H. Bailey. Taken together, they point explicitly to the 
Procumbentes
(Rydb.) L.H. Bailey.The single flower clearly supports this conclusion as well. So the question can be narrowed to which members of the 
Procumbentes
have pedicels bearing stipitate glands, canes with small, sparse prickles, and coarsely serrate leaflets bearing soft abaxial hairs? A search through keys in 
<xref rid="ref17052">
Davis 
et al.
(1968b)
</xref>
and 
<xref rid="ref19936">Widrlechner &amp;Riley (2017)</xref>
and a review of Bailey’s treatments of potential candidates led us to the two taxa that seemed most likely:
</p>
<p>
a. 
<tp:taxon-name>R. invisus (L.H. Bailey) Britton</tp:taxon-name>
, of which the serrature is very similar to the 
type
of v 
illosus
, and
</p>
<p>
b. 
<tp:taxon-name>R. leviculus L.H. Bailey (1943: 390)</tp:taxon-name>
which 
s
eems to correspond better, at least if 
<tp:taxon-name>R. missus L.H. Bailey (1943: 344)</tp:taxon-name>
, with its 5-nate leaves, is included within this species (
<xref rid="ref19818">Widrlechner 1998: 436</xref>
, 439). It also bears few to many short stipitate glands on its pedicels much like 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
<p>
We should note that although 
<tp:taxon-name>R. plicatifolius</tp:taxon-name>
was proposed as a candidate by Blanchard according to 
<xref rid="ref16357">Bailey (1944: 521)</xref>
, by 
<xref rid="ref18735">Rydberg (1913: 472</xref>
; 
<xref rid="ref18760">1915: 156</xref>
), and by Bailey himself (
<xref rid="ref16205">Bailey 1923: 167</xref>
; 
<xref rid="ref16239">1925: 244</xref>
), it lacks stipitate glands and soft hairs on the underside of its leaves, which have an obviously plicate appearance, much like the European taxon, 
<tp:taxon-name>R. plicatus Weihe &amp; Nees.</tp:taxon-name>
The type of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. plicatifolius</tp:taxon-name>
is (

,

</p>
<p>
It should be noted here that 
<xref rid="ref16816">Britton (1893)</xref>
also cited 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus var. humifusus Torr. &amp; Gray (1840: 455)</tp:taxon-name>
, but he borrowed that epithet from Bailey to whom he explicitly and extensively referred. Bailey did not cite 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus var. humifusus</tp:taxon-name>
. Thus, the 
type
must be selected from Bailey’s specimens.
</p>
<p>
A new check of the 
type
and other specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. missus</tp:taxon-name>
confirmed its identity with 
<tp:taxon-name>R. leviculus</tp:taxon-name>
. The 5-foliolate leaves of the 
type
are coincidental; other collections of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. missus</tp:taxon-name>
display 3-foliolate leaves, and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. leviculus</tp:taxon-name>
can also occasionally bear 5-foliolate leaves.
</p>
<p>
Based on 
<xref rid="ref19856">Widrlechner (2013)</xref>
and an examination of more than 
80 specimens
of these two taxa, key differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>R. invisus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. leviculus</tp:taxon-name>
for eight traits are listed in 
<xref>Table 1</xref>
. In addition, we measured two additional characters from 
58 specimens
bearing 1-flowered inflorescences: the length of the shortest 1-flowered inflorescence and the cane diameter at the corresponding node (
<xref>Table 1</xref>
). Based on the data presented in 
<xref>Table 1</xref>
, the 
type
of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus</tp:taxon-name>
at BM corresponds best to 
<tp:taxon-name>R. leviculus</tp:taxon-name>
with few of the characteristic details of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. invisus</tp:taxon-name>
. We conclude that it is identical with 
<tp:taxon-name>R. leviculus</tp:taxon-name>
.

<p>NINETEENTH- CENTURY HOMONYMS</p>
<p>
After Aiton, the name 
<tp:taxon-name>R.villosus</tp:taxon-name>
was twice applied improperly to other taxa during the 19TH century. The first instance was 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus Lasch (1833: 297)</tp:taxon-name>
. The specimen in Lasch’s herbarium is 
<tp:taxon-name>R. umbrosus (Weihe) Arrh. ( Arrhenius 1840: 94 )</tp:taxon-name>
, but because he, in the addenda to his original publication (
<xref rid="ref17958">Lasch 1833: 315</xref>
), stated that 
<tp:taxon-name>R. radula Weihe (1824: 152)</tp:taxon-name>
is identical, his name is a 
nomen superfluum
for 
<tp:taxon-name>R. radula</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
<p>
The other example was 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus Mérat</tp:taxon-name>
, which 
<xref rid="ref18127">Mérat (1843: 440)</xref>
applied to a species that 
<xref rid="ref19467">Vaillant (1727: 174)</xref>
described with the phrase name ‘ 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubus montanus</tp:taxon-name>
repens, sarmentis rotundis, spinis minutissimis munitis, foliis rotundis, utrinque lanatis, superne cinereis, inferne candicantibus, flore albo, fructu nigro, parvo’.Vaillant in turn borrowed this description from Micheli in 
<xref rid="ref19175">Tilli (1723: 149)</xref>
.

The validating description is by Micheli, and the 
type
must be selected from his specimens.Usually original specimens for such old names are no longer extant, but Mrs.Chiara Nepi(Botanical SectionNaturalHistoryMuseumUniversityofFlorence,FI)found, after a long search, a specimen with its label corresponding to the protologue.It consists of two inflorescences and some primocane leaves, though without a piece of the stem itself,mounted on three sheets. It is wonderful to find such an old specimen consisting of more parts and including primocane leaves.

From the description, one could get the impression that it describes 
<tp:taxon-name>R. aetnicus Cupani</tp:taxon-name>
exWeston (1770: 258).The specimen in Florence, however, shows that it is a hybrid of that species with 
<tp:taxon-name>R. ulmifolius Schott (1818: 42)</tp:taxon-name>
. The petiole is not furrowed; the inflorescence is wider than normal; and the leaves are too large for 
<tp:taxon-name>R. aetnicus</tp:taxon-name>
. Field research in middle 
Italy
conducted by the senior author (cf. 
<xref rid="ref16455">Beek 2014: 178</xref>
) over several years showed that hybrids of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. aetnicus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. ulmifolius</tp:taxon-name>
are abundant in that region in great variation, and the sample fits into that swarm.

Micheli’s plant must be considered part of that group and, by consequence, its correct name is 
<tp:taxon-name>R. collinus DC ( De Candolle 1815: 545 )</tp:taxon-name>
. Unfortunately, due to the late validation of Micheli’s description, this name is both a later homonym and a later synonym. Nevertheless, it was validly published, and, thus, Micheli’s plant is the 
type
of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. villosus Mérat</tp:taxon-name>
:
