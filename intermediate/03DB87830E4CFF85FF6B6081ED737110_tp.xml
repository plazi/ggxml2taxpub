The original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. pectinatus</tp:taxon-name>
by 
<xref rid="ref28485">Poey (1860)</xref>
is based on a 
310 mm
TL specimen. However, 
<xref rid="ref28867">Rivas (1986)</xref>
stated that no specimen that agrees with the original description could be found in MCZ, USNM, or any other museum. The 
neotype
(CAS-SU 1602) designated by 
<xref rid="ref28867">Rivas (1986)</xref>
is a specimen from 
Havana

Molecular data.
Specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. pectinatus</tp:taxon-name>
form a strongly supported cluster, with 100% bootstrap value, in the COI sequences analysis (
<xref rid="fig-15--151-250-1944-1968-">Figure 8</xref>
). The genetic distance between 
<tp:taxon-name>C. pectinatus</tp:taxon-name>
and other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Centropomus</tp:taxon-name>
ranged from 0.047 to 0.190 (
<xref>Table 7</xref>
). The genetic analyses indicate that 
<tp:taxon-name>C. pectinatus</tp:taxon-name>
is the sister group of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. medius</tp:taxon-name>
.

Description.
Morphometrics and meristics data are summarized in 
<xref>Tables 8</xref>
, 
<xref>9</xref>
and 
<xref>10</xref>
on the basis of 
14 specimens
, 
63.7–259.9 mm
TL (
191.3 mm
average). Body slightly elongate, body moderately high, mean body height 26.6% SL (24.4%–29.9%); head moderately long, mean head length 36.9% SL (34.2%–42.8%); head moderately high, mean head height 22.9% SL (19.3%–25.4%); largest specimen measured 
196.5 mm
SL. Lower jaw protractile, longer than upper jaw, extending beyond tip of snout. Snout narrow and long, mean snout length 12.0% SL (10.7%–13.3%); eye medium, mean orbital diameter 19.4% HL. Preoperculum heavily serrated in adults; operculum smooth, without spines, bordered by a membrane that extends beyond origin of pectoral fin; 3–5 small spines in dorsal part of operculum.
</p>
<p>Dorsal fins separated by a small gap, not connected by membrane, first dorsal fin always VIII, second dorsal fin I,11. Pectoral fin with 13–15 rays, longest ray extending beyond origin of pelvic fin. Pelvic fin I,5, longest ray usually reaching anus. Anal fin III,8, third spine longer than second spine, usually reaching caudal-fin base when close to body (adpressed). Caudal fin deeply forked. Lateral line with ctenoid scales, extending onto caudal fin. Lateral line with 47–52 scales to caudal-fin base, 50–56 scales extending onto end of caudal fin. Scale rows between lateral line and origin of second dorsal fin 8–10; scale rows between lateral line and origin of anal fin 9–12. 14–16 lower limb gill rakers on first arch; 20–23 gill rakers on first arch, excluding rudiments; 19–21 gill rakers on second arch, including rudiments.</p>

Distribution.
<tp:taxon-name>Centropomus pectinatus</tp:taxon-name>
occurs from south Florida, Gulf of Mexico, Antilles, to 
Paraná
, 
Brazil
. The record of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. pectinatus</tp:taxon-name>
in the Pacific (CAS-SU 2952) is erroneous, since the material examined herein and literature records strongly indicate that the species is restricted to the Western Atlantic.
