Description.
The species displays two distinct morphotypes: one forming simple plumes (
<xref rid="fig-4--151-250-1060-1084-">Fig. 2</xref>
) and one building comparatively taller colonies whose stems are provided with irregularly-arranged cladia-bearing branches (
<xref rid="fig-11--151-250-1316-1340-">Fig. 6</xref>
). Due to their different appearance and structure, they are described separately below.
</p>
<p>
Unbranched colonies solitary, erect, up to 
8 cm
high, relatively rigid (quite able to support themselves when out of liquid), feather-like, arising from a tangled mass of thin, highly-ramified, stolonal tubes embedded in sand. Stems simple, moderately-fascicled, not exceeding 
0.75 mm
in width basally, composed of a centrally-placed, cladia-bearing, main tube, surrounded by a varied number of auxiliary tubes. Main tube relatively thick and unsegmented, with rather thick, smooth perisarc; equivalents of internodes moderately-long, bearing a latero-distal apophysis supporting a cladium; apophysis not always distinctly delimited from the corresponding cladium but, when present, node oblique; apophysis well-developed, with a distally-placed, conical mamelon (with circular aperture on summit) on adaxial surface, and a pair of axillar nematothecae, one on each lateral side. Auxiliary tubes equally undivided, with two parallel, longitudinal rows of nematothecae, arranged either in pairs or irregularly alternate. Cladia unbranched, alternate, closely-set, in two parallel, coplanar rows; up to 
12 mm
long, regularly divided by distinct, slightly oblique nodes into up to 30 cormidia; each internode relatively long, with a hydrotheca almost centrally-placed, although closest to the proximal node and not occupying the whole length of the cormidium, and its complement of 3 nematothecae, one mesial and a pair of laterals; proximal-most cormidium occasionally with twin mesial nematothecae. Hydrotheca inverted-conical, rather deep, abaxial wall straight to imperceptibly convex, with thickened perisarc, latero-adaxial wall equally thickened and consequently opaque, slightly concave; a perisarc plug at junction between the base and the adaxial wall; hydropore rounded, set close to the abaxial wall; hydrothecal aperture semicircular (in apical view), set at a right angle to the internode. Mesial nematotheca seated well below the hydrothecal base on an adaxial prominence of the internode wall; lateral nematothecae borne on indistinct apophyses, slightly below the hydrothecal rim. Each cladial internode with a number of incomplete internal ridges of perisarc originating adaxially: two flanking above and below the mesial nematotheca, one radiating from the perisarc plug prolonging abaxially the hydrothecal base, one occasionally present in middle of the adaxial hydrothecal wall, two flanking above and below the lateral nematothecae, as well as one (occasionally two) close to the distal node. Phylactocarps up to 3 to each cormoid, given off on one side (that becomes frontal) of the colony from a thick, internal, auxiliary tube that surfaces from inside the fascicled stem at an angle of about 35–40°; up to 
19 mm
long, borne on a short, smooth pedicel prolonged distally into the longitudinal axis proper; the latter unsegmented, bearing up to 44 stacked verticils, each of which is composed of 3 ramuli (with the exception of the first, occasionally second, whorl) forming an angle of 120° between them; ramuli from every other verticil arranged in the same position, while those belonging to consecutive verticils alternate in position; ramuli hollow tubes, antler-shaped, divided dichotomously twice, occasionally showing an incipient third division, distally opening into small, circular apertures; pedicel of phylactocarp with 2–4 pairs of nematothecae on adaxial side, remainder of axis athecate; adaxial side of undivided, proximal part of ramulus with a pair of proximal nematothecae, followed by a broadly triangular, raised area of thinner perisarc on which are borne 
ca
. 3–4 gonothecae (at different developmental stages), and ending more distally into two successive pairs of nematothecae; first order branches of ramulus with 1–2 pairs of nematothecae displaced laterally; second order branches of ramulus with a number of irregularly-placed nematothecae, with a tendency to alternate. Proximal-most whorl of ramuli generally composed of only two latero-abaxial ramuli; occasionally, there may be an unpaired, abaxial ramulus, followed by a pair, and then by regular, alternating rows of three. Gonothecae broadly ovoid, somehow laterally flattened, thin-walled, aperture distal, transversely-set, ovoid in outline, closed by flimsy, deciduous operculum; the 
type
of gonophore could not be ascertained in this fixed material. All nematothecae of a colony trumpet-shaped, movable, bithalamic, with tall lower chamber and shallow upper chamber, the adaxial wall of the latter with distinct emargination. Hydranths contracted inside their corresponding hydrothecae; tentacle number could not be ascertained.

Branched colony erect, 
ca
. 
22 cm
high, rather flaccid, unable to fully support itself when out of liquid, arising from a large mass of enmeshing, thin, ramified fibers embedded in sand. Stem 
1 mm
wide basally, fascicled, grading to monosiphonic distally; lower half without branches and/or cladia, upper half cladiate, giving rise to 5 irregularly-arranged branches springing in all directions; branches up to 
3.5 cm
long, given off out- and slightly upward, then arching gracefully nearly horizontally; proximally lightly fascicled, grading to monosiphonic distally. Main tube of stem and branches undivided; equivalents of stem internodes with a latero-distal apophysis supporting a cladium, and 1–2 nematothecae in central part of the opposite side, towards the middle of the internode; apophyses well-developed, with a conspicuous, conical mamelon (with small, rounded aperture on summit) on adaxial side, a pair of axillar nematothecae (one on each side of apophysis), as well as with twin, distally-placed, adaxial nematothecae, just below the slightly oblique node that separates the apophysis from the corresponding hydrocladium; internodes of cladia-bearing branches comparatively shorter than their cauline counterparts, without proximal nematothecae, but with similar cladial apophyses, the latter however not delimited distally, but confluent with the corresponding cladia. The latter alternate, the two rows coplanar on both stem and branches; up to 
5 mm
long on stem and 
7 mm
long on branches; divided homomerously into up to 16 regular internodes through distinct, slightly oblique nodes; internodes moderately long, with a hydrotheca placed centrally, and its complement of 3 nematothecae, one mesial and a couple of laterals; there are 5 internal septa to each internode, of which 2 pairs flank below and above the nematothecae, while the last one is placed towards the distal node. Hydrotheca deep, conical, abaxial wall almost straight for nearly its whole length, basally convex; adaxial wall distinctly thickened, displaying a wide flange of gradually thinner perisarc on each side of the theca; aperture distinctly sloping adaxially, rim even. Mesial nematotheca well below the hydrothecal base, seated on a distinct, proximal, adaxial prominence of the internode; lateral nematothecae borne on small, though distinct apophyses given off at the junction of the lateral hydrothecal wall with the internode behind; lateral nematothecae greatly surpassing the hydrothecal rim. Hydranths contracted inside their hydrothecae, 
type
of tentacles and their number could not be ascertained.

Gonosome forming phylactocarps on the distal parts of the branches; phylactocarps arising from either the accessory tubes or the cladia-bearing tube, but given off amongst the hydrocladia in a plane perpendicular to theirs, and projecting upward; proximal most phylactocarps all aligned along a median row but, more distally, alternately shifted on to each side, occasionally forming divergent pairs; phylactocarps short, tubular, arching upward from the axis of cladia-bearing branch, but not being demarcated basally from it by a node; composed of a proximal (axillar) pair of nematothecae (one to each side), followed immediately by 2 consecutive pairs of foramina (for the insertion of gonothecae), another pair of nematothecae towards the central part, and a distal hydrotheca, together with its complement of 3 nematothecae. Gonothecae urn-shaped, thin-walled, except below the aperture, tapering below into an indistinct, laterally-set pedicel; aperture circular, operculum not seen; 
type
of gonophore and sex could not be ascertained. All the nematothecae of the colony alike; conical, moderatelylong, bithalamic, lower chamber deep, upper chamber relatively shallow, with rim emarginated of adaxial side.

Remarks.
<xref rid="ref15594">Nutting (1900)</xref>
supplemented the original account on 
<tp:taxon-name>C. gracilis</tp:taxon-name>
with a redescription of the 
type
material, a text that was reproduced later on by 
<xref rid="ref14128">Fraser (1944)</xref>
. Although many details of its microscopical anatomy remained overlooked, Nutting confirmed the polysiphonic structure of the stem.
</p>
<p>
As noted in the descriptive section, two morphotypes occur in the present collection, one being a typical 
<tp:taxon-name>Callicarpa , sensu Fewkes (1881)</tp:taxon-name>
, while the other has an 
<tp:taxon-name>Antomma</tp:taxon-name>
-like appearance; they can be easily mistaken for two distinct species, although the results of the molecular study (see below) demonstrate that both are conspecific.
</p>
<p>
In the unbranched colonies, the phylactocarps “resemble spikes of barley” (
<xref rid="ref13809">Fewkes 1881: 135</xref>
) and, unlike in the 
type
material in which there were “no hydrothecae on the ribs or at the base of the verticils”, the proximal most ramuli do not always comprise exclusively the usual branched, hollow, nematothecate tubes. Indeed, a ramulus can be replaced by a short, either simple (MNHN-IK-2015-629) or bifid (MNHN-IK-2015-652), cladium. In this case, the proximal part of the ramulus comprises a short axis, provided basally with 2 laterally-placed, axillar nematothecae (at origin from the longitudinal axis of the phylactocarp), immediately followed by the site of the insertion of gonothecae and –after a short distance– by another pair of nematothecae, all ending in a hydrotheca with its complement of 3 nematothecae. From here, the ramulus is either prolonged by a sequence of hydrothecate internodes (MNHN-IK-2015-629), or by a short, bifid, distal projection above the hydrotheca (each branch is provided with a single, basal nematotheca) carrying a succession of hydrothecate internodes, with or without intervening ahydrothecate internodes bearing single nematothecae (MNHN-IK-2015-652). In some other instances, above the proximal-most hydrotheca, there is a bifid projection (whose short branches do not bear nematothecae) provided with a pair of hollow spikes with nematothecae (MNHN-IK-2015-628). In order to preserve the integrity of these rare specimens, the structures mentioned above were not illustrated.

Type
material of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. gracilis</tp:taxon-name>
was represented by a 
ca
. 
15 cm
high colony, whose proximal part of the stem bore the stump of a potential broken branch (although this could have been well the pedicel of a broken phylactocarp). A comparatively taller, branched colony is present in material MNHN-IK-2015-632. Its trophosome resembles that of 
<tp:taxon-name>Antomma longicarpa ( Nutting, 1900 )</tp:taxon-name>
, as illustrated by 
<xref rid="ref13809">Fewkes (1881</xref>
, as 
<tp:taxon-name>Hippurella annulata Allman, 1877</tp:taxon-name>
), in being represented by a stem with pinnately-arranged cladia that gives rise irregularly to a number of cladia-bearing branches, both the stem and its branches being fascicled.
</p>
<p>
Although their respective cladia are almost indistinguishable morphologically, there are several differences occurring in the branched morphotype compared to its unbranched counterpart: 1) the cladial apophyses of the stem possess distally twin nematothecae (
<xref rid="fig-12--151-250-1857-1881-">Fig. 7A, B</xref>
), but their presence is, however, inconstant, although it is not clear whether this is a normal situation or the consequence of a possible mechanical breakage; such nematothecae were never observed in any of the unbranched colonies at hand; 2) the gonosome of the branched morphotype is not represented anymore by a morphologically-complex structure, but by the equivalent of a radial section of it, comprising only single or twin ramuli, that have spread over the distalmost part of the axis of a cladia-bearing branch; 3) this said, it is however not clear whether the specimen at hand displays a fully-developed gonosome or, in other words, if the structures illustrated in 
<xref rid="fig-12--151-250-1857-1881-">Figs 7K, L</xref>
and 
<xref rid="fig-13--151-250-1475-1499-">8B, C</xref>
represent incipient phylactocarps or the components of an entire phylactocarp fused to the axis of a cladia-bearing branch; additional fertile specimens are expected to answer the question; 4) each phylactocarp/ramulus represents the equivalent of the proximal-most portion of a ramulus that include hydrothecate internodes, as described in the unbranched colonies.

Besides 
<tp:taxon-name>C. gracilis</tp:taxon-name>
, the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Callicarpa</tp:taxon-name>
comprises a second species, 
<tp:taxon-name>C. chazaliei Versluys, 1899</tp:taxon-name>
, that is distinguished from the former through the following characters: 1) its cladia are comparatively more distant from one another; 2) its hydrocladial internodes possess a distal, unpaired nematotheca above the hydrotheca; 3) the ramuli of its phylactocarps are reportedly branched once instead of twice.

in 1880 who, according to 
<xref rid="ref13809">Fewkes (1881: 127)</xref>
, sailed “off the eastern coast of the 
United States
, in the summer of 1880”. 
<xref rid="ref15594">Nutting (1900: 85)</xref>
, however, expressed the opinion that it “belongs doubtless to the West Indian fauna”, but this appears to be inexact in light of the data provided by the descriptor. The specimens dealt with in the present study represent the first record for 
French Guiana
