Nomenclatural notes
. The genus 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Bibiopsis Heer</tp:taxon-name>
, based on a fossil, has historically been treated as a junior synonym of 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria ( Loew 1868 )</tp:taxon-name>
, as a distinct genus (
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref36200">Scudder 1891</xref>
), and as a junior synomym of a broadly-defined 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
(including 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia Wiedeman</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Protomyia Heer</tp:taxon-name>
; 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref33735">Handlirsch 1907</xref>
). More recently, 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref32810">Evenhuis (1994</xref>

<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref32873">2014</xref>

<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Bibiopsis</tp:taxon-name>
as a junior synonym of 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
. However,

Generic Diagnosis
. The following combination of characters will distinguish adults of extant members of the genus 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
from other 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae</tp:taxon-name>

elongate and subparallel to R

(
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-38--151-264-1892-1916-">Fig. 58</xref>
) can be distinguished from the larva of other bibionids by the combination of the following characters: presence of fleshy tubercles (each abdominal segment with two transverse rows of two tubercles each), posterior spiracle on segment eight, posterior spiracle with a single ecdysial scar, and the mentum not fused to the anterior margin of the cranium or to the posterior margin of the labium (Fitzgerald 2004, Fig. 36b; pm). Pupae (
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-38--151-264-1892-1916-">Figs. 59–60</xref>
) can be distinguished from all other bibionid genera except 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
by the presence of fleshy tubercles.

Discussion supporting generic diagnosis
. The generic diagnosis presented above is based on previous phylogenetic and descriptive work on the family 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae (Fitzgerald 2004)</tp:taxon-name>
and readers are referred there for further information concerning material examined or the broader context from which the diagnosis was developed. The diagnosis is designed for extant species, but reference to problems and exceptions when diagnosing fossil species are provided below. Additionally, characters not necessarily considered diagnostic, but that may be useful in helping to distinguish the genus, are also discussed.
</p>
<!--template match = paragraph--><p>
The relatively large adults of 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
are usually matte-black, with dark wings. They are sometimes confused with some of the large species of tropical 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Sciaridae</tp:taxon-name>
, but are easily distinguished from them by the absence of a narrow eye bridge and the presence of vein R 
2+3
: in 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
males are holoptic and females broadly dichoptic (
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-4--151-250-1982-2006-">Fig. 1</xref>
) (though the odd Palearctic species, 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>P. funebris Meigen</tp:taxon-name>
, has males with eyes that do not quite meet dorsomedially). Adults of 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
are distinguished from other 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae</tp:taxon-name>
by the apically simple fore tibia (
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Bibioninae</tp:taxon-name>
all have apex of fore tibia modified into a long mucron or a circlet of shorter spines), relatively short antennae with compact antennal flagellomeres (
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
with flagellomeres elongate), and vein R 
2+3
elongate and subparallel to R 
4+5
(e.g., 
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-11--151-264-1518-1542-">Figs. 2</xref>
, 
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-19--151-264-1948-1972-">13</xref>
, 
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">21b</xref>
, 
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-26--151-250-1995-2019-">23</xref>
) (R 
2+3
absent in 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Bibioninae</tp:taxon-name>
). The elongate R 
2+3
subparallel to R 
4+5
is the character typically employed in keys for distinguishing 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
from the similar genus 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
, which has R 
2+3
shorter and more oblique or vertical (
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">Fig. 22</xref>
). Despite the fact that some species/specimens of 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
have R 
2+3
approaching the condition found in 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g., compare 
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">Figs. 21a &amp; 22a</xref>
) and that the form of R 
2+3
is essentially evaluated by gestalt rather than any discrete measurement, the extant species can typically be distinguished in this way with confidence.
</p>
<!--template match = paragraph--><p>
The use of R 

2+ 
3

in distinguishing these genera becomes more problematic with fossils, where there is a continuum in the form of R 
2+3
between typical 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
(
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref32489">
Collomb 
et al
. 2008
</xref>
, and e.g. see discussion of 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
by 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref36689">Skartveit &amp; Nel 2017</xref>
). It may be useful, based on extant taxa, to develop a more objective way of describing the form of R 

2+ 
3

in order to help more accurately place fossil taxa. For example, in the wing variation of the extant species presented in 
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">Figs. 21–22</xref>
, 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
can be defined by the slope of R 
2+3
less than 0.43 and 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
by the slope of R 
2+3
greater than 0.74 (slope defined here as rise/run, where rise = measure of imaginary line between points y and z, and where run = measurement of imaginary line between points x and z (see 
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">Fig. 22b</xref>
)). However, when slope is applied to the continuum of the form of R 
2+3
found in fossil species, it is not as clear. For example, if slope is measured for the 15 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
and 15 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
wings illustrated by 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref36689">Skartveit &amp; Nel (2017)</xref>
, with a line discriminating 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
with slope&gt;= 0.50, it would correctly assign alone 27 of the 30 wings (i.e., without evaluating any other aspect of morphology). More variation should be studied before determining whether such a definition could be employed, but utilizing a discrete definition of slope and understanding the breadth of variation in the form of R 
2+3
(or other veins) of extant species would undoubtably help to objectify the generic placement of fossil taxa.
</p>
<!--template match = paragraph--><p>
In addition to differences in the shape of R 
2+3
, 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
differ in the form of the male terminalia; the male terminalia in 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
are very simple, plesiomorphic (e.g., see 
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-15--151-264-1945-1969-">Fig. 7</xref>
), relatively homogenous, with a stout, simple, gonostylus articulating in a socket formed from a relatively elongate gonocoxite. The male terminalia in 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
are much more complex, show great interspecific variability (see e.g., 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref33819">Hardy 1945</xref>
, 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref33025">Fitzgerald 1998</xref>
) and tend to have the tubular, gonostyus-socket-portion of the gonocoxite greatly shortened. However, this is less true in fossil specimens. As 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref36689">Skartveit and Nel (2017)</xref>
point out, the male terminalia of some fossil 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
are very plesiomorphic and 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
-like (e.g., see 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref32489">
Collomb 
et al
. 2008
</xref>
).
</p>
<!--template match = paragraph--><p>
Additionally, 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
has subtle parapsidal sutures (longitudinal sutures on the mesonotum corresponding to the position of dorsocentral setae), while they are often present as distinct grooves in 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
. Females of the two genera can be also be distinguished by 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
having two segmented-cerci and 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
with one-segmented cerci—though some fossil 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g., 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>P. clavifemur Skartveit 2009</tp:taxon-name>
) have been described with two-segmented cerci.
</p>
<!--template match = paragraph--><p>
It is also noteworthy that 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
and the bibionid genus 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
cannot be reliably distinguished based on wing venation alone (
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref36439">Skartveit 2009</xref>
), which is critical in situations where the fossil specimen is represented only by a preserved wing. In fossils where more than the wing has been preserved, 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
has shorter antennae, with more compact flagellomeres and tends to be more stout-bodied, with shorter legs than 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
. Additionally, males of 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
are typically holoptic while both sexes of 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
are dichoptic. See also “Intraspecific Variation” (below) with respect to the delimitation of fossil species.

<!--template match = paragraph--><p>
Classification and phylogenetic placement
. Some studies have placed 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
, along with the genus 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
, in the subfamily 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Pleciinae</tp:taxon-name>
of 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g., 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref34196">Hardy 1981</xref>
, 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref32292">Blaschke-Berthold 1994</xref>
) or in the separate family 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Pleciidae</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g., 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref34608">Krivosheina 1986</xref>
) based, in part, on similarities in the larvae of these genera including the “clearly separated frons and clypeus, presence of an additional lobe of the maxillae, and primitive spiracles” (
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref34582">Krivosheina 1969</xref>
) or musculature of the male terminalia (
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref35626">Ovtshinnikova 1994</xref>
).
</p>
<!--template match = paragraph--><p>
More recent morphological phylogenetic studies, however, have not supported these classifications, instead placing 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
in its own subfamily (Penthetriinae), which is considered the most basal lineage of bibionids after 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
(
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>

<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref35898">Pinto &amp; Amorim 2000</xref>
, Fitzgerald 2004). This latter hypothesis was not corroborated by the molecular study by 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref36295">
Ševčík 
et al
. (2016)
</xref>
, which found 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
(along with 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
) to be less basal within the bibionid family tree (
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Bibioninae</tp:taxon-name>
+ (
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
+ (

<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>

))). 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref36526">Skartveit &amp; Ansorge (2020)</xref>
propose placing 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
together in the subfamily 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Hesperininae</tp:taxon-name>
based on the

study, which finds these two genera to be sister taxa. Further work is needed to reconcile the contradictory hypotheses of these morphological and molecular studies.

Characters to support the monophyly of 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
are sparse. Fitzgerald (2004) suggested the larval mesothorax with two pseudosegments as a synapomorphy, but so few larvae are known that this character will have to be further vetted as the larvae of more species are discovered.

Comments on generic description
. The adult and larval generic description provided below is based, in part, on previous phylogenetic and descriptive work on the family 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae (Fitzgerald 2004)</tp:taxon-name>
and readers are referred there for further discussion concerning homology of structures, material examined, and the broader context from which the description was developed.

A sclerotized aedeagus is considered absent in 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
by Fitzgerald (2004) and it has been presented this way in the generic description (below). 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref32292">Blaschke-Berthold (1994</xref>
, 
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-13--151-264-1964-1988-">Fig. 6</xref>
) suggests that the aedeagus is fused with the parameres in this genus but whether it is absent or indistinguishably fused, a distinct, separate aedeagal sclerite cannot be identified. Sperm transfer in 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
is apparently not achieved via an intromittent organ, but probably by spermatophore (Blaschke-Bethold 1994), as is known in some other 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae ( Leppla et al . 1975 )</tp:taxon-name>

Generic description
. 
Adult
: Small to moderately large flies 4.0-11.0 mm. Head: Male head dorsoventrally compressed; in dorsal view, slightly wider than long, oval-shaped. Head and antennae black to brown. Male with almost entire dorsal surface of head occupied by broadly holoptic compound eye (
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-4--151-250-1982-2006-">Fig. 1</xref>

<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>P. funebris</tp:taxon-name>
, with compound eyes narrowly separated dorsally by longitudinal strip of frons approximately subequal in width to antennal flagellum. Male compound eye strongly divided into larger dorsal region and smaller ventral region; dorsal region usually lighter in color than ventral region and with larger ommatidia. Division between dorsal and ventral regions of compound eye often distinguished by distinct narrow longitudinal step (the dorsal region of the eye is often taller than the ventral region of the eye; where the dorsal and ventral regions meet laterally, a short step, curb, or groove is often visible as in 
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-19--151-264-1948-1972-">Fig. 12</xref>
). Division not marked by narrow, longitudinal, shining, sclerotized band; smooth, triangular area devoid of ommatidia also absent. Female head dorsoventrally compressed, slightly wider than long. Female compound eye round or oval in shape, convex, dichoptic (
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-4--151-250-1982-2006-">Fig. 1</xref>

Fossil Record
. Compression fossils are known from the Nearctic and Palearctic regions; most of these are Oligocene and Miocene in age, with a few from the Eocene and Pliocene/Pleistocene (

<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria dubia Geinitz</tp:taxon-name>

nor a 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae</tp:taxon-name>
and should be removed from the family, thus making the oldest compression fossils of this genus Eocene in age (e.g., 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref36064">Rice 1959</xref>
).Additionally, 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref36439">Skartveit (2009)</xref>
described two species from Baltic amber, which are also Eocene in age. One of these species is quite peculiar as vein R

, where it seems to fit better than anywhere else in 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae</tp:taxon-name>
. It is possible that this species is based on a specimen with a teratological wing, as in cases known in extant species of 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
(pers. obs.) and 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus ( Paramonov 2005 )</tp:taxon-name>
where R

is absent. It is noteworthy that some of the Mesozoic stem-bibionids currently placed in 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Protopleciidae</tp:taxon-name>
have wing venation identical to

Bionomics
. Little is known about the biology of the adults of this genus, but it is assumed to be similar to other members of the family (summaries of biology can be found, e.g., in

, 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref33226">Fitzgerald 2009</xref>
). However, while there are numerous records of other bibionid genera (especially 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Bibioninae</tp:taxon-name>
) being collected on flowers, the label data of none of the New World 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
specimens indicate that any were collected on flowers, which seems unusual (the author is unaware of any records of adult feeding in this genus). Seasonal activity varies between species and region (e.g., 
<!--template match = tableCitation--><xref>Table 1</xref>
). 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref35785">Pecina (1965)</xref>
states that adults of the Palearctic 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>P. funebris</tp:taxon-name>
emerge in mid-April and are gone by mid-May, though “they may be found singly later.” Curiously,

, working on the same species in the same country but 50 years later, found peak emergence was in late May and early June, though this disparity may be due to differences in altitude or annual seasonal variables. At a similar latitude in the Nearctic region, 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>P. heteroptera (Say)</tp:taxon-name>
is fall-emerging, rather than spring-emerging, but has a similarly narrow duration of adult activity, with most adult records from a two-month window of time. In contrast to these temperate species with narrow windows of adult activity, the Neotropical species

females do not burrow, but lay their eggs within small crevices on the surface, as do females of

Most of the known biological information on the genus comes from studies of the larvae of

The saprophagous larvae live in the top layers of soil and “feed selectively on partially decomposed leaves, which are densely colonized by bacteria and fungi” and “their coprophagic behavior allows [the larva] to harvest the microbial production in their faeces during a second gut passage, providing bibionid larvae with an important energy and nutrient source” (

also notes that the larvae live solitarily in the soil in contradistinction to members of the

, which are gregarious, but this statement is difficult to interpret as many of the studies appear to find larvae in high numbers.

<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>P. funebris</tp:taxon-name>
has seven larval instars and spends most of its developmental time (as well as usually overwinters) in the sixth instar, which takes about two months to reach; the seventh instar and pupa were inferred to have short durations based on the fact that they were infrequently detected.

Intraspecific Variation
. While the general form of 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
species is remarkably homogeneous (most species look very similar to 
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-4--151-250-1982-2006-">Fig. 1</xref>
), there is considerable intraspecific variation that makes identification and species delimitation challenging. Some of the characters that have been previously used to help distinguish species, such as whether vein R 
2+3
has an appendix at the base (
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref33819">Hardy 1945</xref>
), have been found to be variable (pers. obs.) and not consistently present or absent within a given species (e.g., 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>P. appendicula</tp:taxon-name>
typically but not always has an appendix (
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-11--151-264-1518-1542-">Fig. 2</xref>
, ba), 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>P. distincta</tp:taxon-name>
generally does not but may have an appendix, and 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>P. neonigrita</tp:taxon-name>
usually does not but rarely does have an appendix). Additionally, some species have a tendency to have CuA and CuP meeting apically near the wing margin forming a closed cell cua (
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-29--151-264-1324-1348-">Fig. 32</xref>
), yet this character is not consistent when numerous specimens are studied. In some cases, one wing will have a closed cell cua and the other wing has an open cell (pers. obs). Plasticity in the wing venation (e.g., presence/absence of an appendix on R 
2+3
, length of stem of M, and position of r-m crossvein) has also been noted in some of the Palearctic species (
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref35546">Nartshuk 1990</xref>
, 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref34730">Krivosheina &amp; Krivosheina 1998</xref>
). Unfortunately, the strong plasticity of the wing venation observed in extant taxa does not bode well for the taxonomy of fossil members of the group, since many species have been delimited largely or solely on differences in wing veins. For example, the slope and length of vein R 
2+3
has been used to help delimit both extant and fossil species. The study of the intraspecific variation of this character in extant species indicates that vein R 
2+3
can vary drastically in slope and length even between specimens of the same species collected from sites that are relatively near each other (e.g., 
<!--template match = figureCitation--><xref rid="fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">Figs. 21</xref>
a–b). Concerns about how the intraspecific variation found in the wing venation of extant species of bibionids translates into the delimitation of fossil species was previously raised by 
<!--template match = bibRefCitation--><xref rid="ref32489">
Collomb 
et al

. His study noted the plasticity of the length and shape of r-m in

<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
and arrived at the conclusion that male terminalia were the best source of information for delimiting fossil species (which mirrors conclusions by those working on extant taxa). It is possible that the number of fossil species of 
<!--template match = taxonomicName--><tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
(and possibly other genera) have been artificially inflated due to variable wing venation described under several names.Additional examples of intraspecific variation in the genus can also be found under “
