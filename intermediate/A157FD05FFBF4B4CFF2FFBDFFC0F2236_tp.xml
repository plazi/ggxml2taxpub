Nomenclatural notes
. The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibiopsis Heer</tp:taxon-name>
, based on a fossil, has historically been treated as a junior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria ( Loew 1868 )</tp:taxon-name>
, as a distinct genus (
<xref rid="ref36200">Scudder 1891</xref>
), and as a junior synomym of a broadly-defined 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
(including 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia Wiedeman</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Protomyia Heer</tp:taxon-name>
; 
<xref rid="ref33735">Handlirsch 1907</xref>
). More recently, 
<xref rid="ref32810">Evenhuis (1994</xref>
, 
<xref rid="ref32873">2014</xref>
) treated 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibiopsis</tp:taxon-name>
as a junior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
. However, 
<xref rid="ref34441">Heer’s (1849</xref>
; Plate XV, 
<xref rid="fig-27--151-264-1849-1873-">Fig. 24b</xref>

2+3
elongate and subparallel to R 
4+5
, rather than short and angled, which indicates that this taxon belongs to the genus

Generic Diagnosis
. The following combination of characters will distinguish adults of extant members of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
from other 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae</tp:taxon-name>
: Fore tibia simple (without apical mucron or spines), R 
2+3
elongate and subparallel to R 
4+5
, and antennal flagellomeres short, compact.

<p>
The larva of 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
(
<xref rid="fig-38--151-264-1892-1916-">Fig. 58</xref>
) can be distinguished from the larva of other bibionids by the combination of the following characters: presence of fleshy tubercles (each abdominal segment with two transverse rows of two tubercles each), posterior spiracle on segment eight, posterior spiracle with a single ecdysial scar, and the mentum not fused to the anterior margin of the cranium or to the posterior margin of the labium (Fitzgerald 2004, Fig. 36b; pm). Pupae (
<xref rid="fig-38--151-264-1892-1916-">Figs. 59–60</xref>
) can be distinguished from all other bibionid genera except 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
by the presence of fleshy tubercles.

Discussion supporting generic diagnosis
. The generic diagnosis presented above is based on previous phylogenetic and descriptive work on the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae (Fitzgerald 2004)</tp:taxon-name>
and readers are referred there for further information concerning material examined or the broader context from which the diagnosis was developed. The diagnosis is designed for extant species, but reference to problems and exceptions when diagnosing fossil species are provided below. Additionally, characters not necessarily considered diagnostic, but that may be useful in helping to distinguish the genus, are also discussed.
</p>
<p>
The relatively large adults of 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
are usually matte-black, with dark wings. They are sometimes confused with some of the large species of tropical 
<tp:taxon-name>Sciaridae</tp:taxon-name>
, but are easily distinguished from them by the absence of a narrow eye bridge and the presence of vein R 
2+3
: in 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
males are holoptic and females broadly dichoptic (
<xref rid="fig-4--151-250-1982-2006-">Fig. 1</xref>
) (though the odd Palearctic species, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. funebris Meigen</tp:taxon-name>
, has males with eyes that do not quite meet dorsomedially). Adults of 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
are distinguished from other 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae</tp:taxon-name>
by the apically simple fore tibia (
<tp:taxon-name>Bibioninae</tp:taxon-name>
all have apex of fore tibia modified into a long mucron or a circlet of shorter spines), relatively short antennae with compact antennal flagellomeres (
<tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
with flagellomeres elongate), and vein R 
2+3
elongate and subparallel to R 
4+5
(e.g., 
<xref rid="fig-11--151-264-1518-1542-">Figs. 2</xref>
, 
<xref rid="fig-19--151-264-1948-1972-">13</xref>
, 
<xref rid="fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">21b</xref>
, 
<xref rid="fig-26--151-250-1995-2019-">23</xref>
) (R 
2+3
absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibioninae</tp:taxon-name>
). The elongate R 
2+3
subparallel to R 
4+5
is the character typically employed in keys for distinguishing 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
from the similar genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
, which has R 
2+3
shorter and more oblique or vertical (
<xref rid="fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">Fig. 22</xref>
). Despite the fact that some species/specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
have R 
2+3
approaching the condition found in 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g., compare 
<xref rid="fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">Figs. 21a &amp; 22a</xref>
) and that the form of R 
2+3
is essentially evaluated by gestalt rather than any discrete measurement, the extant species can typically be distinguished in this way with confidence.
</p>
<p>
The use of R 

2+ 
3

in distinguishing these genera becomes more problematic with fossils, where there is a continuum in the form of R 
2+3
between typical 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
(
<xref rid="ref32489">
Collomb 
et al
. 2008
</xref>
, and e.g. see discussion of 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
by 
<xref rid="ref36689">Skartveit &amp; Nel 2017</xref>
). It may be useful, based on extant taxa, to develop a more objective way of describing the form of R 

2+ 
3

in order to help more accurately place fossil taxa. For example, in the wing variation of the extant species presented in 
<xref rid="fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">Figs. 21–22</xref>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
can be defined by the slope of R 
2+3
less than 0.43 and 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
by the slope of R 
2+3
greater than 0.74 (slope defined here as rise/run, where rise = measure of imaginary line between points y and z, and where run = measurement of imaginary line between points x and z (see 
<xref rid="fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">Fig. 22b</xref>
)). However, when slope is applied to the continuum of the form of R 
2+3
found in fossil species, it is not as clear. For example, if slope is measured for the 15 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
and 15 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
wings illustrated by 
<xref rid="ref36689">Skartveit &amp; Nel (2017)</xref>
, with a line discriminating 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
with slope&gt;= 0.50, it would correctly assign alone 27 of the 30 wings (i.e., without evaluating any other aspect of morphology). More variation should be studied before determining whether such a definition could be employed, but utilizing a discrete definition of slope and understanding the breadth of variation in the form of R 
2+3
(or other veins) of extant species would undoubtably help to objectify the generic placement of fossil taxa.
</p>
<p>
In addition to differences in the shape of R 
2+3
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
differ in the form of the male terminalia; the male terminalia in 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
are very simple, plesiomorphic (e.g., see 
<xref rid="fig-15--151-264-1945-1969-">Fig. 7</xref>
), relatively homogenous, with a stout, simple, gonostylus articulating in a socket formed from a relatively elongate gonocoxite. The male terminalia in 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
are much more complex, show great interspecific variability (see e.g., 
<xref rid="ref33819">Hardy 1945</xref>
, 
<xref rid="ref33025">Fitzgerald 1998</xref>
) and tend to have the tubular, gonostyus-socket-portion of the gonocoxite greatly shortened. However, this is less true in fossil specimens. As 
<xref rid="ref36689">Skartveit and Nel (2017)</xref>
point out, the male terminalia of some fossil 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
are very plesiomorphic and 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
-like (e.g., see 
<xref rid="ref32489">
Collomb 
et al
. 2008
</xref>
).
</p>
<p>
Additionally, 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
has subtle parapsidal sutures (longitudinal sutures on the mesonotum corresponding to the position of dorsocentral setae), while they are often present as distinct grooves in 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
. Females of the two genera can be also be distinguished by 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
having two segmented-cerci and 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
with one-segmented cerci—though some fossil 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g., 
<tp:taxon-name>P. clavifemur Skartveit 2009</tp:taxon-name>
) have been described with two-segmented cerci.
</p>
<p>
It is also noteworthy that 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
and the bibionid genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
cannot be reliably distinguished based on wing venation alone (
<xref rid="ref36439">Skartveit 2009</xref>
), which is critical in situations where the fossil specimen is represented only by a preserved wing. In fossils where more than the wing has been preserved, 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
has shorter antennae, with more compact flagellomeres and tends to be more stout-bodied, with shorter legs than 
<tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
. Additionally, males of 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
are typically holoptic while both sexes of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
are dichoptic. See also “Intraspecific Variation” (below) with respect to the delimitation of fossil species.
</p>
<p>
Classification and phylogenetic placement
. Some studies have placed 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
, along with the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
, in the subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Pleciinae</tp:taxon-name>
of 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g., 
<xref rid="ref34196">Hardy 1981</xref>
, 
<xref rid="ref32292">Blaschke-Berthold 1994</xref>
) or in the separate family 
<tp:taxon-name>Pleciidae</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g., 
<xref rid="ref34608">Krivosheina 1986</xref>
) based, in part, on similarities in the larvae of these genera including the “clearly separated frons and clypeus, presence of an additional lobe of the maxillae, and primitive spiracles” (
<xref rid="ref34582">Krivosheina 1969</xref>
) or musculature of the male terminalia (
<xref rid="ref35626">Ovtshinnikova 1994</xref>
).
</p>
<p>
More recent morphological phylogenetic studies, however, have not supported these classifications, instead placing 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
in its own subfamily (Penthetriinae), which is considered the most basal lineage of bibionids after 
<tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
+ (
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
+ 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibioninae</tp:taxon-name>
))) (
<xref rid="ref35898">Pinto &amp; Amorim 2000</xref>
, Fitzgerald 2004). This latter hypothesis was not corroborated by the molecular study by 
<xref rid="ref36295">
Ševčík 
et al
. (2016)
</xref>
, which found 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
(along with 
<tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
) to be less basal within the bibionid family tree (
<tp:taxon-name>Bibioninae</tp:taxon-name>
+ (
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
+ (

Penthetria
+ 
Hesperinus

))). 
<xref rid="ref36526">Skartveit &amp; Ansorge (2020)</xref>
propose placing 
<tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
together in the subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Hesperininae</tp:taxon-name>
based on the 
<xref rid="ref36295">
Ševčík 
et al
. (2016)
</xref>
study, which finds these two genera to be sister taxa. Further work is needed to reconcile the contradictory hypotheses of these morphological and molecular studies.
</p>
<p>
Characters to support the monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
are sparse. Fitzgerald (2004) suggested the larval mesothorax with two pseudosegments as a synapomorphy, but so few larvae are known that this character will have to be further vetted as the larvae of more species are discovered.

Comments on generic description
. The adult and larval generic description provided below is based, in part, on previous phylogenetic and descriptive work on the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae (Fitzgerald 2004)</tp:taxon-name>
and readers are referred there for further discussion concerning homology of structures, material examined, and the broader context from which the description was developed. Examination of all the New World species, as well as a small number of species from the Palearctic and Oriental bioregions were examined.
</p>
<p>
A sclerotized aedeagus is considered absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
by Fitzgerald (2004) and it has been presented this way in the generic description (below). 
<xref rid="ref32292">Blaschke-Berthold (1994</xref>
, 
<xref rid="fig-13--151-264-1964-1988-">Fig. 6</xref>
) suggests that the aedeagus is fused with the parameres in this genus but whether it is absent or indistinguishably fused, a distinct, separate aedeagal sclerite cannot be identified. Sperm transfer in 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
is apparently not achieved via an intromittent organ, but probably by spermatophore (Blaschke-Bethold 1994), as is known in some other 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae ( Leppla et al . 1975 )</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
<p>
Larvae are known for only two species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
. Aspects of the larva of the Palearctic species 
<tp:taxon-name>P. funebris</tp:taxon-name>
have been illustrated in various papers—mandible (

Generic description
. 
Adult
: Small to moderately large flies 4.0-11.0 mm. Head: Male head dorsoventrally compressed; in dorsal view, slightly wider than long, oval-shaped. Head and antennae black to brown. Male with almost entire dorsal surface of head occupied by broadly holoptic compound eye (
<xref rid="fig-4--151-250-1982-2006-">Fig. 1</xref>
), except 
<tp:taxon-name>P. funebris</tp:taxon-name>
, with compound eyes narrowly separated dorsally by longitudinal strip of frons approximately subequal in width to antennal flagellum. Male compound eye strongly divided into larger dorsal region and smaller ventral region; dorsal region usually lighter in color than ventral region and with larger ommatidia. Division between dorsal and ventral regions of compound eye often distinguished by distinct narrow longitudinal step (the dorsal region of the eye is often taller than the ventral region of the eye; where the dorsal and ventral regions meet laterally, a short step, curb, or groove is often visible as in 
<xref rid="fig-19--151-264-1948-1972-">Fig. 12</xref>
). Division not marked by narrow, longitudinal, shining, sclerotized band; smooth, triangular area devoid of ommatidia also absent. Female head dorsoventrally compressed, slightly wider than long. Female compound eye round or oval in shape, convex, dichoptic (
<xref rid="fig-4--151-250-1982-2006-">Fig. 1</xref>
), broadly separated by frons. Female compound eye with inconspicuous, slight longitudinal depression dividing compound eye, but lacking any difference in size of ommatidia or color between dorsal and ventral regions. Compound eye of both sexes bare or clothed with minute, stiff, or very elongate hairs. Ocellar tubercle well developed and prominent in males, moderately to weakly developed in females. Both sexes with three ocelli arranged in small, equilateral triangle. Female with small tubercle or longitudinal ridge just posterior to antennal sockets. Male frons reduced to small, triangular region between anterior margin of compound eye, posterior margin of antennal sockets bearing minute tubercle (or a minute pit in 
<tp:taxon-name>P. funebris</tp:taxon-name>
). Sclerotized rostrum not produced, oral margin somewhat ventral in position. Antenna located anteriorly along oral margin, with 7–10 short, stout flagellomeres. Flagellomeres slightly broader than long, except most basal flagellomere, about two times as long as subsequent flagellomere. Pedicel and flagellomeres with subapical ring of short setae and numerous dense, minute, appressed setae. Apical flagellomere slightly more elongate than preceding flagellomere, with rounded point apically. Maxillary palps with five segments; basal segment minute, third segment thickened with dorsal, diagonal sensory pit with dense, minute, specialized setae; apical palpomere slender, more elongate than previous palpomeres. Clypeus broader than long, never elongate. Head entirely sclerotized ventrally. Thorax (
<xref rid="fig-11--151-264-1518-1542-">Fig. 3</xref>
): Precoxal-bridge complete. Basisternum present, presternum absent. Dorsum of thorax smooth, matte, often with thick dark pruinosity, usually black, dark brown, anteriorly black and posteriorly orange, or rarely entirely orange, as in 
<tp:taxon-name>P. indica (Brunetti)</tp:taxon-name>
. Parapsidal sutures subtle and not distinct as in some 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
. Dorsum of thorax with dense, short, stiff to very elongate hairs, laterally, anteriorly, and in dorsocentral rows posteriorly. Thoracic pleura black to dark brown. Males with minute to moderately long hairs on metakatepisternum, and dorsal half of katepisternum. Anepisternum bare or with cluster of hairs at posterior margin. Meron, laterotergite, and mediotergite bare. Female thoracic pleura generally less hairy than male. Legs: Legs black to dark brown. All legs with five tarsomeres, simple tarsal claws, pulvilli and pulvilliform empodia. Anterior coxa short and not reaching ventral edge of katepisternum; reaching about half length of katepisternum in lateral view, usually with elongate hair. Fore femur relatively slender and more elongate; not short and swollen. Fore tibia elongate, slender, apex unmodified, outer edge not developed into a mucron.

Fossil Record
. Compression fossils are known from the Nearctic and Palearctic regions; most of these are Oligocene and Miocene in age, with a few from the Eocene and Pliocene/Pleistocene (
<xref rid="ref32873">Evenhuis 2014</xref>
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria dubia Geinitz</tp:taxon-name>
was described from the Lower Jurassic (
Germany

<xref rid="ref33569">Geinitz 1884</xref>

) it is not a 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
nor a 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae</tp:taxon-name>
and should be removed from the family, thus making the oldest compression fossils of this genus Eocene in age (e.g., 
<xref rid="ref36064">Rice 1959</xref>
).Additionally, 
<xref rid="ref36439">Skartveit (2009)</xref>
described two species from Baltic amber, which are also Eocene in age. One of these species is quite peculiar as vein R

is absent, but based on other features it was included in 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
, where it seems to fit better than anywhere else in 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibionidae</tp:taxon-name>
. It is possible that this species is based on a specimen with a teratological wing, as in cases known in extant species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
(pers. obs.) and 
<tp:taxon-name>Hesperinus ( Paramonov 2005 )</tp:taxon-name>
where R

is absent. It is noteworthy that some of the Mesozoic stem-bibionids currently placed in

have wing venation identical to 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g.,

Bionomics
. Little is known about the biology of the adults of this genus, but it is assumed to be similar to other members of the family (summaries of biology can be found, e.g., in 
<xref rid="ref34196">Hardy 1981</xref>
, 
<xref rid="ref36370">Skartveit 1997</xref>
, 
<xref rid="ref33226">Fitzgerald 2009</xref>
). However, while there are numerous records of other bibionid genera (especially 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibioninae</tp:taxon-name>
) being collected on flowers, the label data of none of the New World 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
specimens indicate that any were collected on flowers, which seems unusual (the author is unaware of any records of adult feeding in this genus). Seasonal activity varies between species and region (e.g., 
<xref>Table 1</xref>
). 
<xref rid="ref35785">Pecina (1965)</xref>
states that adults of the Palearctic 
<tp:taxon-name>P. funebris</tp:taxon-name>
emerge in mid-April and are gone by mid-May, though “they may be found singly later.” Curiously, 
<xref rid="ref33496">
Frouz 
et al
. (2015)
</xref>
, working on the same species in the same country but 50 years later, found peak emergence was in late May and early June, though this disparity may be due to differences in altitude or annual seasonal variables. At a similar latitude in the Nearctic region, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. heteroptera (Say)</tp:taxon-name>
is fall-emerging, rather than spring-emerging, but has a similarly narrow duration of adult activity, with most adult records from a two-month window of time. In contrast to these temperate species with narrow windows of adult activity, the Neotropical species 
<tp:taxon-name>P. neonigrita Fitzgerald</tp:taxon-name>

, has been recorded every month of the year except April. 
<xref rid="ref37430">
Yuan

reported that lab reared 
<tp:taxon-name>P. japonica</tp:taxon-name>

<xref rid="ref33496">
Frouz

found the adult life span of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. funebris</tp:taxon-name>
was relatively short (less than one month) and that females laid about 
130 eggs
, which hatched within a few days. Unlike 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibioninae</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Plecia</tp:taxon-name>
have the fore tibia unmodified; based on this, it is assumed that 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
females do not burrow, but lay their eggs within small crevices on the surface, as do females of

Most of the known biological information on the genus comes from studies of the larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. funebris</tp:taxon-name>
in Europe, where this species is found to be important in nutrient cycling and the decomposition of forest litter (
<xref rid="ref33417">

, 
<xref rid="ref33496">

). The saprophagous larvae live in the top layers of soil and “feed selectively on partially decomposed leaves, which are densely colonized by bacteria and fungi” and “their coprophagic behavior allows [the larva] to harvest the microbial production in their faeces during a second gut passage, providing bibionid larvae with an important energy and nutrient source” (
<xref rid="ref36843">
Šustr 
et al

). Based on studies of larval biomass and laboratory consumption of leaf litter, 
<xref rid="ref33496">
Frouz

determined that the larvae of this species is responsible for consuming roughly 40% of the annual litter fall at the study site. 
<xref rid="ref35785">Pecina (1965)</xref>
reports larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. funebris</tp:taxon-name>
“inhabiting moist soils with the mouldering remains of vegetables” and that they are “commonly found on the banks of bodies of water where the larvae develop under the litter of deciduous trees, especially of alders and poplars, or in moist meadows.” 
<xref rid="ref35785">Pecina (1965)</xref>
also notes that the larvae live solitarily in the soil in contradistinction to members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Bibioninae</tp:taxon-name>

<xref rid="ref33597">Gemesi &amp; Disney (1991)</xref>
reported that during the month of September, mature larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. funebris</tp:taxon-name>
were collected in decaying leaf litter of alder trees (

overwinters as a mature larva. Based on measurements of larval head capsules, 
<xref rid="ref33496">
Frouz

</xref>
determined that 
<tp:taxon-name>P. funebris</tp:taxon-name>
has seven larval instars and spends most of its developmental time (as well as usually overwinters) in the sixth instar, which takes about two months to reach; the seventh instar and pupa were inferred to have short durations based on the fact that they were infrequently detected.

<tp:taxon-name>P. funebris</tp:taxon-name>

in the following regions: Europe (

Intraspecific Variation
. While the general form of 
<tp:taxon-name>Penthetria</tp:taxon-name>
species is remarkably homogeneous (most species look very similar to 
<xref rid="fig-4--151-250-1982-2006-">Fig. 1</xref>
), there is considerable intraspecific variation that makes identification and species delimitation challenging. Some of the characters that have been previously used to help distinguish species, such as whether vein R 
2+3
has an appendix at the base (
<xref rid="ref33819">Hardy 1945</xref>
), have been found to be variable (pers. obs.) and not consistently present or absent within a given species (e.g., 
<tp:taxon-name>P. appendicula</tp:taxon-name>
typically but not always has an appendix (
<xref rid="fig-11--151-264-1518-1542-">Fig. 2</xref>
, ba), 
<tp:taxon-name>P. distincta</tp:taxon-name>
generally does not but may have an appendix, and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. neonigrita</tp:taxon-name>
usually does not but rarely does have an appendix). Additionally, some species have a tendency to have CuA and CuP meeting apically near the wing margin forming a closed cell cua (
<xref rid="fig-29--151-264-1324-1348-">Fig. 32</xref>
), yet this character is not consistent when numerous specimens are studied. In some cases, one wing will have a closed cell cua and the other wing has an open cell (pers. obs). Plasticity in the wing venation (e.g., presence/absence of an appendix on R 
2+3
, length of stem of M, and position of r-m crossvein) has also been noted in some of the Palearctic species (
<xref rid="ref35546">Nartshuk 1990</xref>
, 
<xref rid="ref34730">Krivosheina &amp; Krivosheina 1998</xref>
). Unfortunately, the strong plasticity of the wing venation observed in extant taxa does not bode well for the taxonomy of fossil members of the group, since many species have been delimited largely or solely on differences in wing veins. For example, the slope and length of vein R 
2+3
has been used to help delimit both extant and fossil species. The study of the intraspecific variation of this character in extant species indicates that vein R 
2+3
can vary drastically in slope and length even between specimens of the same species collected from sites that are relatively near each other (e.g., 
<xref rid="fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">Figs. 21</xref>

(and possibly other genera) have been artificially inflated due to variable wing venation described under several names.Additional examples of intraspecific variation in the genus can also be found under “
