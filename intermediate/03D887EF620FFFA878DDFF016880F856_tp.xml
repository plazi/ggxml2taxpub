Diagnosis.
<tp:taxon-name>Nothobranchius elucens</tp:taxon-name>
is distinguished from all other members of the genus by the following characters in males: body colouration golden-grey with brown scale margins creating irregular vertical stripes on trunk; anal fin yellow with brown spots proximally, with slender brown median band, followed by a slender light blue subdistal band and a slender black distal band; caudal fin brown proximally and medially, followed by a slender light blue subdistal band and a slender black distal band; dorsal fin golden with irregular brown blotches and stripes, with narrow light blue subdistal band and narrow black distal band. Furthermore, it differs from

The type locality is a large temporary pool formed on the floodplain of the seasonal Aringa River (
<xref rid="fig-10--151-250-1512-1536-">Fig. 6</xref>
). The habitat belongs to category 1.1, as defined by 
<xref rid="ref9277">Watters (2014)</xref>
, representing an isolated pool in a shallow depression on a floodplain, formed primarily as a result of natural processes. At the end of the first peak of the rainy season, the habitat was a large and shallow pool more than 
50 m
long and about 
30 m
wide, and about 
1 m
at the deepest point. At the 
type
locality, all collecting took place in the same general habitat. Aquatic vegetation comprised 
<tp:taxon-name>Nymphea</tp:taxon-name>
sp., whereas the edge of the habitat was partially overgrown with grass. The water was turbid, the bottom of the pool was not visible. The water temperature around noon was 33.6° C, the pH was 7.8 and it contained 107 ppm of total dissolved solids.

No conservation measures are in place for this species. It is not known from any protected areas. There is a need for improved habitat protection at the 
type
locality, currently the only site where the species is known to occur. Additional collecting efforts targeting suitable habitats should be conducted in the region in order to better understand the geographic distribution of this species and to elaborate on the appropriate conservation measures.
</p>
<p>
Biology.
Aquarium maintenance of selected specimens was undertaken for observation of breeding behaviour and biology. 
<tp:taxon-name>Nothobranchius elucens</tp:taxon-name>
has an annual mode of reproduction, typical of the genus. Eggs are deposited in the habitat substrate, where they survive the dry season and hatch with the onset of the wet season. Under captive conditions, peat moss was used successfully as an artificial spawning substrate. An embryonic development period of three to five months was observed at a temperature of about 22–24 °C.

Etymology.
The specific name 
<tp:taxon-name>elucens</tp:taxon-name>
is a Latin participial adjective meaning ‘shining out’ and is given with reference to the distinctive light blue subdistal band in the anal and caudal fins, contrasting and shining out of the overall dark colouration of body and fins of the males.
