<p>
<tp:taxon-name>Toxicodryas blandingii</tp:taxon-name>
was originally described by Hallowell (1845:170) based on a single specimen collected by his friend, “Dr. Blanding,” in 
Liberia
. The dorsum and venter of the specimen was noted to have a “light yellow” color with a series of blotches of “leaden colour.” This specimen reportedly possessed 2 preoculars, 2 postoculars, 272 ventrals, 131 subcaudals, body length (i.e., SVL) of 1.22 meters, and tail length of 0.39 meters. 
<xref rid="ref30165">Hallowell (1854)</xref>
provided additional details of the specimen’s teeth, noted it had 17 “rows of scales,” and corrected the tail length to 0.37 meters.

noted the

was a 
1.67 m
specimen, slightly longer than the total length of 
1.61 m
reported by Hallowell (1845) in the original description, but the longer measurement is likely a typographical error in reference to the latter citation (V. Wallach, pers. comm.). A query by EG to the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences in spring 2020 resulted in location of the 
type
specimen (ANSP 10083,

According to 
<xref rid="ref32014">Loveridge (1957:269)</xref>
, the name 
<tp:taxon-name>Dipsas Fischeri</tp:taxon-name>
was proposed by Jan (in 
<xref rid="ref29038">Duméril 1859</xref>
) to combine the minor color pattern variants 
<tp:taxon-name>Dipsas fasciata</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>D . valida</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>D . globiceps</tp:taxon-name>
named by 
<xref rid="ref29308">Fischer (1856)</xref>
. 
<xref rid="ref33796">Pel (1852:171)</xref>
coined the name 
<tp:taxon-name>Dipsas regalis</tp:taxon-name>
, and as translated by 
<xref rid="ref35380">Savage &amp; McDiarmid (2017:73)</xref>
, Pel stated, “the third species of venomous snake, 
<tp:taxon-name>Naja atropos</tp:taxon-name>
, belongs to cobras (spectacled snakes) and reaches a length of 
6 to 7 feet
[
1.8–2.1 m
]. Its color is entirely black... As this snake in general shows much similarity to a tree snake, 
<tp:taxon-name>Dipsas regalis</tp:taxon-name>
, which equals it in color and size, but is not venomous.” Perhaps because of this poor description, 
<xref rid="ref26812">Boulenger (1896:78)</xref>
attributed the latter name to 
<xref rid="ref30749">Jan &amp; Sordelli (1870</xref>
–1881), who provided an illustration that served as an appropriate description. Jan listed the name in the 
Index des Planches
for Livraison 38 as 
<tp:taxon-name>Dipsas cynodon Cuv.</tp:taxon-name>
variété? (
<tp:taxon-name>D . regalis Schlegel</tp:taxon-name>
), but according to 
<xref rid="ref35380">Savage &amp; McDiarmid (2017:73)</xref>
, the attribution to Hermann Schlegel is in error because he never used the name in any publication. 
<xref rid="ref32936">Müller (1885:687)</xref>
seemed to suggest that Jan illustrated his specimen (collected by Dr. Mähly from “Goldküste” [i.e., 
Gold Coast
or modern-day 
Ghana
]) from Basel, but 
<xref rid="ref30630">Hughes &amp; Barry (1969:1020)</xref>
listed a personal communication from M.S. Hoogmoed, who noted the 
type
of 
<tp:taxon-name>D . regalis</tp:taxon-name>
(specimen “Leiden 958”) was collected by Pel in 
February 1844
from Accra, 
Ghana
.

<tp:treatment-sec sec-type="description">
<p>
<xref rid="ref30217">Hallowell (1857:60)</xref>
coined the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Toxicodryas</tp:taxon-name>
because he noticed that his specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>T . blandingii</tp:taxon-name>
had a “single channelled posterior tooth on each side... and therefore...[it] cannot belong to the genus Triglophodon [sic] of Dum. and Bibron, which has three.” Subsequent herpetological publications in the 19 
<sup>th</sup>
and early 20 
<sup>th</sup>
centuries seemingly ignored Hallowell’s new genus and continued to recognize the taxon in either the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Dipsas</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g., 
<xref rid="ref32787">Mocquard 1896</xref>
) or more commonly, 
<tp:taxon-name>Dipsadomorphus</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g., 
<xref rid="ref26812">Boulenger 1896</xref>
, 
<xref rid="ref26869">1919</xref>
; 
<xref rid="ref28527">de Witte 1933</xref>
). 
<xref rid="ref35449">Schmidt (1923)</xref>
transferred the taxon to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Boiga</tp:taxon-name>
in his opus on Congolese snakes, recognizing 
<tp:taxon-name>B . ( Toxicodryas ) blandingii</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>B . ( Toxicodryas ) pulverulenta</tp:taxon-name>
, an action that was followed by most subsequent authors for decades. Based on the placement of African 
<tp:taxon-name>Boiga</tp:taxon-name>
in the “ 
<tp:taxon-name>Dipsadidae</tp:taxon-name>
: 
<tp:taxon-name>Lycodontinae</tp:taxon-name>
” by 
<xref rid="ref36617">Underwood (1967)</xref>
, 
<xref rid="ref37350">Welch (1982)</xref>
seems to have been the first to recognize the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Toxicodryas</tp:taxon-name>
for both species of the genus, an action followed by 
<xref rid="ref32469">Meirte (1992)</xref>
and observed by most herpetologists in the 21 
<sup>st</sup>
century (e.g., 
<xref rid="ref36529">

</xref>
).
</p>
<p>
<xref rid="ref26812">Boulenger (1896)</xref>
included all of the above West African, 19 
<sup>th-</sup>
century names in the synonymy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Dipsas ( Toxicodryas ) blandingii</tp:taxon-name>
. Because the dubious subspecies described by 
<xref rid="ref35957">Stucki-Stirn (1979)</xref>
both occur in 
Cameroon
, where one molecular sample (CAS 253611) from Allen 
et al
. (in press) is recovered in a well-supported clade with West African samples (
<xref rid="fig-3--151-250-1837-1861-">Fig. 2</xref>

<xref rid="ref37025">

Variation.
Morphometric variation of 
<tp:taxon-name>Toxicodryas blandingii</tp:taxon-name>
is shown in 
<xref>Table 1</xref>
. 
<xref rid="ref32936">Müller (1885:688)</xref>
provided data for a snake from 
Ghana
with 15 infralabials and noted that most of its scales have two “Endgruben” [terminal pits], which likely refer to apical pits. In his description of 
<tp:taxon-name>Dipsas globiceps var. tumboensis Müller (1885)</tp:taxon-name>
noted his specimen from 
Guinea
(
<xref rid="fig-12--151-250-1802-1826-">Fig. 7</xref>
) had 147 subcaudals. In snakes from West Africa (without separating by sex), 
<xref rid="ref26404">Angel (1933)</xref>
noted a temporal formula of 2 + 2 or 2 + 3, 21–25 scales at midbody, 240–289 ventrals, 120–147 subcaudals, either an undivided or divided cloacal plate, and a maximum total size of 
2290 mm

with 115 subcaudals. 
<xref rid="ref27467">Cansdale (1965)</xref>

<p>
In our examined specimens, temporal formula includes the variation noted by 
<xref rid="ref26404">Angel (1933)</xref>
, but is more extensive (2 +5, 3 + 4, 3 + 3, 1 + 5, 3 + 2, or 2 + 4), and either supralabials 3–5 or 4–6 contact the eye, which is consistent with the observations of 
<xref rid="ref26404">Angel (1933)</xref>
, 
<xref rid="ref36677">Villiers (1950b)</xref>
, and 
<xref rid="ref27912">Chippaux (2006)</xref>
; the latter author also noted that sometimes only 2 supralabials contact the eye. 
<xref rid="ref34964">Rasmussen (1997a)</xref>
noted specimens with the 4th–5th, 5th–7 
<sup>th</sup>
, or 4th–7

supralabials in contact with the eye, and in general, this species has sloping and smooth scales with apical pits, and the vertebral row is greatly enlarged. The

one male

Cameroon
(

<xref rid="ref30593">Hughes (2000:8)</xref>
noted juvenile and subadult (approximately 
1 meter

</p>
<p>
<xref rid="ref27912">Chippaux (2006:154)</xref>
noted there are two dorsal color morphs: (1) uniform black or dark blue with “reflets veloutés” [velvety reflections] or (2) gray with darker, poorly defined transverse spots. The venter was noted as dull yellow to charcoal gray, and juvenile coloration as light brown with darker transverse ring-shaped spots. 
<xref rid="ref35957">Stucki-Stirn (1979)</xref>

<xref rid="ref33751">Pauwels &amp; Vogel (2011:24)</xref>

fell from the wooden roof of a golf club building from a height of 
3 m
onto a lawn. The snake was caught for the purpose of photography. It had apparently swallowed two smaller prey, and bats peeped excitedly from the hollow roof. The animal was carefully photographed for about ten minutes, remaining calm and not attempting to bite. Suddenly it opened its mouth and froze all movements. It couldn’t be made to move again. Even turning on its back did not lead to any reaction, and the snake remained motionless, as if dead, with its mouth wide open. Slight movements of the trachea could be registered.

Reproduction.

Geographic distribution.
Based on molecular data from Allen

Guinea-Bissau
