As noted by 
<xref rid="ref27543">
Ceríaco 
et al
. (2018)
</xref>
, the description of this species was based on 
two specimens
(only 
one syntype
remains today according to 
<xref rid="ref29969">Hallermann 1998</xref>
and 
<xref rid="ref36335">

), one of which was depicted in plate 4 of livraison 38 by Jan &amp; Sordelli (1871). In a footnote to the nomenclatural history of 
<tp:taxon-name>Boiga ( Toxicodryas ) pulverulenta , Hughes &amp; Barry (1969:1020)</tp:taxon-name>
wrote “Dr. Ladiges [then curator at ZMH] tells us that the type is still in Hamburg and is from St. Thomé, 
not
Edina, 
Grand Bassa County
, 
Liberia
as stated by Loveridge (1958:269).” The latter citation is in error (
<xref rid="ref32014">Loveridge 1957</xref>
). 
<xref rid="ref27543">
Ceríaco 
et al
. (2018)
</xref>
deduced that the information from Ladiges was based on an old label associated with the presumed remaining type specimen. Because extensive fieldwork on the island of 
São Tomé
over the last century failed to document this species, 
<xref rid="ref27543">
Ceríaco 
et al
. (2018)
</xref>
concluded that it does not occur there, and the original type locality from 
<xref rid="ref29308">Fischer (1856)</xref>
“Edina, 
Grand Bassa County
in 
Liberia
(West-Afrika)” is correct. Moreover, the former authors determined that the pholidosis from this presumed type (
<xref rid="ref27543">
Ceríaco 
et al
. 2018
</xref>
:fig. 1) is not consistent with the extensively detailed original description, and thus, it is not a type specimen (
contra
<xref rid="ref36335">
Uetz 
et al
. 2019
</xref>
). Although we agree with this conclusion, an examination of this specimen (ZMH 
R04376
) by J. Hallermann (pers. comm.) found some differences in the morphometric data provided by 
<xref rid="ref27543">
Ceríaco 
et al
. (2018)
</xref>
(e.g., SVL = 
635 mm
, not 
880 mm
), and we used these updated data in our analyses of morphological data (
<xref>Table 2</xref>
).
</p>
<p>
<xref rid="ref27693">Chabanaud (1917a:375)</xref>
, convinced that the odd configuration of subcaudals (combination of single and double subcaudals near the vent) seen in 
one male
and 
one female
was unique to 
<tp:taxon-name>Colubridae</tp:taxon-name>
, named the taxon 
<tp:taxon-name>Dipsadomorphus boueti</tp:taxon-name>
from these specimens that were donated by “Dr Bouet,” who collected for the Paris Museum in 
Ivory Coast
(1909) and 
Dahomey
(1910–1913). Unfortunately no specific 
type
locality was provided. 
<xref rid="ref27754">Chabanaud (1917b)</xref>
then clarified and corrected himself by stating that both 
types
were males (the mistaken female was a juvenile), and they were collected from “Porto-Novo” in 
Dahomey
, which is modern-day Porto-Novo, the capital city of 
Benin
. 
<xref rid="ref27792">Chabanaud (1917c)</xref>
subsequently realized that his specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>D . boueti</tp:taxon-name>
represented 
<tp:taxon-name>T . pulverulenta</tp:taxon-name>
individuals with abnormal subcaudals, and he synonymized the former taxon with the latter (as 
<tp:taxon-name>D . pulverulentus</tp:taxon-name>
). We agree with this taxonomic placement, because the 
types
of 
<tp:taxon-name>D . boueti</tp:taxon-name>
have subcaudal counts (106 and 116) and TL/SVL ratios (0.25 and 0.28) that are most consistent with 
<tp:taxon-name>T . pulverulenta</tp:taxon-name>
(
<xref>Table 2</xref>
).
</p>
<p>
The Porto-Novo locality is on the eastern edge of the 
Dahomey
Gap (
sensu
<xref rid="ref28741">
Demenou 
et al
. 2016
</xref>
:fig. 1), a renowned biogeographic barrier to at least some forest-specialist species in West Africa. Because 
<tp:taxon-name>T . pulverulenta</tp:taxon-name>
does not seem to be a strict forest specialist (see Habitat below), and the Porto-Novo locality occurs on the eastern edge of the 
Dahomey
Gap, it is likely that the Gap is not a barrier to dispersal for this species. We therefore hypothesize that the 
Niger
Delta is the biogeographic barrier separating 
<tp:taxon-name>T . pulverulenta</tp:taxon-name>
from its cryptic sister taxon

specimen had seven maxillary teeth that were oriented nearly backwards, becoming larger posteriorly. These were followed by two larger teeth (i.e., fangs) that were furrowed in a “besonderen Hauttasche” [special skin pocket]. There were 10–12 mandibular teeth, which were slightly curved towards the back of the mouth, and increased in size posteriorly. 
<xref rid="ref26663">Bogert (1940:61)</xref>
remarked “ 
five specimens
examined show variation from eleven to thirteen anterior subequal teeth followed after a very short diastema by two larger grooved fangs and a smaller fang, the total number of teeth being fourteen to eighteen.” Because only two of his examined specimens originated from former

<xref rid="ref30795">Johnsen (1962)</xref>
reported that his specimen from 
Liberia
had 11 maxillary teeth on one side, and six on the other. Based on a specimen from 
Liberia
, 
<xref rid="ref32310">Malnate (1972)</xref>
noted the species lacks posterior hypapophyses.
</p>
<p>
In his original description of the species, 
<xref rid="ref29308">Fischer (1856:83)</xref>
described the coloration in great detail as chocolate brown above, yellow below, finely dotted everywhere. On each side, near the back, there was a large number (60– 70) of pale red spots that lacked dark edging and extended over 4–6 scales. Usually the spots on one side alternated with those on the other; sometimes they also were opposite to each other and in this case were connected to weak “Querbinden” [cross-ties] by bright red connecting strips that extended over the back. Usually there was a small black spot under each of these spots on the outermost tip of the corresponding ventral shields. The innumerable fine black points, with which the whole body was sown, were grouped on the abdominal shields on each side at the point where they bent over to rise sideways, to form a black spot, which in their succession looked like a black longitudinal band, whereby the narrow belly appeared delimited from the flanks. Head was brown and without black lines. Upper lip, lower lip, throat yellow, dotted with black. 
<xref rid="ref29923">Günther (1858:173)</xref>
described the dorsum of two Nigerian specimens as “brown with a strong cast of purple” with elliptical transverse streaks, and at mid-body, these streaks had a small yellow spot in their center. In his description of 
<tp:taxon-name>Dipsadomorphus boueti , Chabanaud (1917a)</tp:taxon-name>
noted the 
types
were light brownish gray and dotted with brown, whereas the supralabials and venter were yellowish gray.
</p>
<p>
<xref rid="ref31641">Leeson (1950)</xref>
described animals from 
Ghana
as brownish red on the dorsum, with “dull brown” heads, and “lightly coloured” patches on the flanks that had a black edge on the lower margins. There were more narrow light gray bands on the anterior third of the body that gradually diminished to form light gray patches on the posterior two-thirds of the body. The ventral surface of the head was white or cream, whereas the venter of the body was pinkish with numerous brown spots. Brown lines “commence”[ed] just before the middle of the body on each side of the ventrals, and continued along the edge of the ventrals to the tip of the tail. In his description of 
two specimens
from 
Ivory Coast
, 
<xref rid="ref36677">Villiers (1950b)</xref>
noted their color pattern was pale brownish gray, the dorsal scales dotted with black, the back with alternate dark brown diamond spots (some ocellated with white). Yellowish ventral surface with two black lateral lines. 
<xref rid="ref28813">Doucet (1963)</xref>
noted the dorsal coloration ranged from uniform reddish or yellowish or powdery brown, sometimes with dark bars, with ventral coloration ranging from yellowish to pinkish. 
<xref rid="ref27912">Chippaux (2006)</xref>
noted dorsal coloration as dark beige or reddish with occasional dark gray designs or crossbars; venter pinkish with two dark lateral lines. Based on photographs of an adult male from 
Guinea
(
<xref rid="fig-25--151-250-1885-1909-">Fig. 11B</xref>
), the base of the tongue is orangish red, and the forked tip is silvery white with black edging. Our observations of live specimens suggest the dorsal scales have an almost satiny sheen, similar to the appearance of a spider web (MOR, pers. obs.).
</p>
<p>
Hemipenis.
<xref rid="ref26663">Bogert (1940)</xref>
did not note whether his hemipenis description was based on specimens from 
Liberia

<tp:taxon-name>T . pulverulenta</tp:taxon-name>
) or former 
French Cameroon
(
<tp:taxon-name>T . adamanteus</tp:taxon-name>

<xref rid="ref28813">Doucet (1963:301)</xref>

<tp:taxon-name>blandingi</tp:taxon-name>
. Quite elongated, thorny at the base and dimpled at the apex, it is not bifid. The spines on either side of the sperm groove are very long in the middle part and decrease in size towards the apex and the base. The apex is domed, not flattened.

<xref rid="ref29796">Greene (1989)</xref>
suggested that there is an ontogenetic shift in diet from mostly lizards in young individuals to mostly birds and/or mammals as adults, and some individuals can ingest a third of their body weight if they eat more than one prey item in a nest or roost.
