            <p> Locomotor energetics are an important determinant of an animal’ s ecological niche.
                  It is commonly assumed that animals minimize locomotor energy expenditure by
                  selecting gait kinematics tuned to the natural frequencies of relevant body parts.
                  We demonstrate that this allows estimation of the preferred step frequency and
                  walking speed of <tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus rex</tp:taxon-name> , using an
                  approach we introduce as the Natural Frequency Method. Although the tail of
                  bipedal dinosaurs was actively involved in walking, it was suspended passively by
                  the caudal interspinous ligaments. These allowed for elastic energy storage,
                  thereby reducing the metabolic cost of transport. In order for elastic energy
                  storage to be high, step and natural frequencies would have to be matched. Using a
                  3D morphological reconstruction and a spring-suspended biomechanical model, we
                  determined the tail natural frequency of <tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name>
                  (0.66 s −1 , range 0.41–0.84), and the corresponding walking speed (1.28 m s −1 ,
                  range 0.80–1.64), which we argue to be a good indicator of preferred walking speed
                  (PWS). The walking speeds found here are lower than earlier estimations for large
                  theropods, but agree quite closely with PWS of a diverse group of extant animals.
                  The results are most sensitive to uncertainties regarding ligament moment arms,
                  vertebral kinematics and ligament composition. However, our model formulation and
                  method for estimation of walking speed are unaffected by assumptions regarding
                  muscularity, and therefore offer an independent line of evidence within the field
                  of dinosaur locomotion. </p>

            <p>1. Introduction</p>
            <p> Animals display a variety of gaits and walking speeds. Two locomotor extremes are of
                  particular interest: the maximal speed, and the energetically optimal walking
                  speed, at which the metabolic cost of transport (MCOT, in J m −1 kg −1 ) is
                  minimal for walking gait. In the absence of external task constraints, optimal
                  walking speed is very close to preferred walking speed (PWS) in humans [1,2],
                  ratites [ 3 ], horses [ 4 ] and elephants [ 5 ]. It is likely that they are
                  related in all terrestrial animals, and that animals would tend to forage at this
                  speed. During locomotion at preferred speed, animals tend to make use of resonance
                  by matching locomotor frequencies to the (undamped) natural frequencies of their
                  relevant body parts, sometimes tuned through muscular contractions [ 6 – 13 ].
                  Indeed, it has been demonstrated that mammalian quadrupedal taxa have convergent
                  natural frequencies between fore- and hindlimbs despite differing limb
                  morphologies [14,15]. An important advantage of moving a body part close to its
                  natural frequency is that this reduces mechanical work [16,17]. Based on the
                  commonly adopted idea that PWS is chosen to minimize MCOT [ 1 – 5 ], it has been
                  argued that preferred step frequencies are close to the natural frequencies of
                  relevant body parts [7,11,12]. Determination of the natural frequency of a body
                  part relevant to locomotion can, therefore, constrain preferred (and presumably,
                  optimal) step frequencies and walking speeds of extinct taxa [ 10 ]. </p>
            <p> Theropod dinosaurs had tails that were actively involved in locomotion [18,19], but
                  were passively supported through the caudal interspinous ligaments [ 20 – 22 ],
                  thus forming a mass-spring system. <tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus
                        rex</tp:taxon-name> has been the focus of many locomotor studies [ 23 – 32
                  ]. Its largest muscle, M. caudofemoralis longus (CFL), retracted the femur to
                  produce forward propulsion for locomotion [18,25,33–35] ( ). The tail was subject
                  to flexion torque due to gravity and CFL contractions, which was counteracted at
                  zero metabolic cost by the caudal interspinous ligaments, leading to metaplastic
                  adaptations [ 20 – 22 ] ( ). Elastic energy storage in these ligaments improved
                  locomotor efficiency, and like a mass on a spring, the tail would have oscillated
                  at the step frequency. This is conceptually similar to elastic storage in ungulate
                  neck movement [ 36 – 38 ]. The tail would resonate if step frequency was matched
                  to the tail natural frequency, and this would maximize strain and thus elastic
                  storage [ 39 ]. The principle of elastic energy storage has previously been used
                  to simulate more realistic running gaits of the smaller theropod
                        <tp:taxon-name>Allosaurus fragilis</tp:taxon-name> [ 40 ]. Elastic storage
                  of the caudal interspinous ligaments likely played a smaller role in quadrupedal
                  dinosaurs, due to the less pronounced centre of mass excursions. However, because
                  extant quadrupeds display similar energysaving mechanisms [ 36 – 38 ], our method
                  should also be applicable to the locomotion of quadrupedal dinosaurs, provided
                  their necks or tails were passively suspended by ligamentous structures. </p>
            <p> In recent biomechanical models of non-avian dinosaurs, the focus has been on
                  detailed hindlimb muscular reconstructions, while the tail was simplified to a
                  single rigid structure (for instance: [30,41]). It is our view, however, that tail
                  flexibility is an essential aspect of the locomotion of nonavian dinosaurs. We,
                  therefore, chose to focus on the tail, because investigating the dynamic effects
                  of a compliant tail may provide interesting insights into locomotor capabilities.
                  The primary goal of this study was to develop a reductionist method to estimate
                  PWS for non-avian dinosaurs. To this end, we performed a detailed morphological
                  reconstruction of the tail, including the caudal interspinous ligaments. By
                  incorporating their spring-like properties in a biomechanical model, we
                  subsequently estimated the natural frequency of the vertical swaying of the tail.
                  Using this as an analogue for step frequency, we then combined the tail natural
                  frequency with trackway data to estimate the PWS. We will refer to this approach
                  as the Natural Frequency Method (NFM), and demonstrate its application by
                  determining the PWS for <tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name> . We have also
                  investigated which morphological features of the tail have the largest impact on
                  tail natural frequency. In doing so, we hope to encourage researchers to
                  incorporate a non-rigid tail into their locomotor simulations, while also
                  demonstrating that the relatively simple NFM can be a valuable expansion of the
                  toolkit of palaeo-biomechanists. </p>
            <p>2. Material and methods</p>
            <p> We estimated tail natural frequency of <tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name> , by
                  numerically determining the lowest eigenfrequency of a biomechanical model.
                  Essentially, we constructed this model by estimating inertial parameters of the
                  tail, dividing it into five segments, and then fitting joint spring parameters
                  based on inverse-dynamic relationships of different postures of the skeleton. </p>
            <p> Inertial parameters of this model were based on a 3D volumetric musculoskeletal
                  reconstruction. This reconstruction was performed on adult <tp:taxon-name>T.
                        rex</tp:taxon-name> specimen <tp:material-citation> RGM.792000 (nicknamed
                        ‘Trix’, ), in the collection of Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, The
                        Netherlands </tp:material-citation> . This is a large, adult specimen with
                  exceptional surface preservation, making it possible to accurately distinguish the
                  attachment sites of the interspinous ligaments. We articulated 3D scans of the
                  caudal skeleton ( , electronic supplementary material, ), after which we
                  reconstructed the major caudal musculature to estimate inertial parameters ( ,
                  electronic supplementary material, 4). Using osteological landmarks combined with
                  the physical articulation of 3D prints, we determined the axes of rotation between
                  the vertebrae (electronic supplementary material, figures S5 and S6).
                  Subsequently, we reconstructed the caudal interspinous ligaments ( ), which
                  enabled the determination of moment arms and cross-sectional area ( , electronic
                  supplementary material, figure S7). The morphological reconstruction of the
                  ligaments made it possible to quantify the kinematic relation between vertebral
                  flexion/extension and length of the individual ligaments (i.e. strain), which was
                  used to construct the biomechanical model. Parameters of the reconstruction are
                  provided in electronic supplementary material, table S1 . </p>
            <p> Taking the morphological reconstruction as starting point, we then defined a
                  simplified biomechanical model consisting of five rigid bodies, connected in hinge
                  joints, with a nonlinear rotational spring at each joint ( and for angle
                  definitions). During walking, the most prominent movements and forces occur in the
                  sagittal plane, and the moment arm of the CFL is also the largest in this plane.
                  Furthermore, the exchange between gravitational and elastic potential energy is
                  most meaningfully studied in this plane. Therefore, similar to previous
                  researchers [27,30], we elected to perform a sagittal plane analysis. Inertial
                  properties of the rigid bodies were acquired from the corresponding segments of
                  the morphological reconstruction. Each of the rotational springs was assumed to
                  generate a torque that increased quadratically with joint angle when stretched [
                  42 ]. As a result, each joint spring has two parameters: joint angle at which the
                  spring torque is zero, and a stiffness parameter. To assign values to these
                  parameters, the biomechanical model was aligned with the morphological
                  reconstruction in two different postures in which the spring torques were known (
                  ). We acquired the first posture by defining passive horizontal equilibrium, which
                  implies that the ligaments are strained in horizontal posture to counteract
                  gravity ( ). It has been shown that the interspinous ligaments could generate
                  ample force to maintain this pose [ 20 ], which our models confirm (see the
                  electronic supplementary material). In the second posture, all interspinous
                  ligaments were at resting length, and thus, all spring torques equalled zero. We
                  determined this posture on the basis of an assumption regarding the ligament
                  strain in horizontal equilibrium. Tendons and ligaments can be roughly divided
                  into low-stress and high-stress varieties, with the high-stress varieties
                  providing more energy savings at the cost of lower safety factors [ 39 ]. We
                  imposed an intermediate 4% strain in horizontal equilibrium ( εhor = 0.04), and
                  used this to find a pose where the ligaments are not strained ( ). This is
                  analogous to passive equilibrium in the absence of gravity, or a <tp:taxon-name>T.
                        rex</tp:taxon-name> lying on its side. After aligning the biomechanical
                  model with the morphological reconstruction in both postures, the mechanical
                  equilibrium conditions were used to calculate the parameter values of each
                  rotational spring. </p>
            <p> In the absence of damping, the resonance of the tail would occur at the undamped
                  natural frequency ( fn ) of the system [ 43 ]. In reality, damping is omnipresent.
                  In that case, resonance occurs at a forcing frequency of fn · (1 – 2 β2 ) 0.5 ,
                  with β being the damping ratio [ 43 ]. Ligaments (like tendons) display relatively
                  little energy loss during work-loop experiments [39,44], so they have low damping
                  ratios. However, damping of dorsoventral oscillations would be dependent on more
                  than just the ligaments, and a structure-based estimate of damping would be
                  difficult, if not impossible. Therefore, we will use the undamped natural
                  frequency of the biomechanical model as a proxy for the resonance frequency. To
                  calculate the natural frequency of the biomechanical model, we first linearized
                  the equations of motion in horizontal equilibrium using standard numerical
                  methods. Next, the five pairs of conjugated purely imaginary eigenvalues of the
                  system matrix were determined using the ‘eig’ function in MATLAB. Subsequently,
                  the natural frequency was calculated as the oscillation frequency pertaining to
                  the fundamental resonance mode, i.e. the mode with the lowest eigenfrequency.
                  Finally, walking speed was estimated by multiplying the natural frequency of each
                  model by step length, defined as half the distance between two consecutive
                  footfalls of the same foot. We determined a step length of 1.94 m by scaling a
                  large tyrannosaurid trackway [ 45 ] based on footprint length of RGM.792000 (see
                  the electronic supplementary material for details). </p>
            <p>As was done in previous studies on dinosaur dimensions [27,33,46,47], we subjected
                  the major inputs to a sensitivity analysis. Since we hope to see future studies of
                  dinosaur locomotion incorporate our tail model, we intentionally chose wide bounds
                  for the sensitivity analysis. This serves to inform researchers which individual
                  steps in the modelling process induce the largest variation in the result. These
                  steps could then be the focus of future research in an attempt to reduce the
                  uncertainty.</p>
            <p> To account for uncertainty in inertial estimates, we individually varied length (and
                  thus moment of inertia) and mass. Because we assumed 4% ligament strain in
                  horizontal equilibrium, we investigated the effects of low- and high-stress
                  ligaments on the result, by imposing 3% and 5% strain in horizontal equilibrium,
                  respectively [ 39 ]. Although each ligament is well-bounded by the skeleton, the
                  effective point of force application of each ligament was unknown. In the baseline
                  model, we based the moment arms on the area centroids of the ligaments. We used
                  the ligament reconstruction to determine bounds for the moment arms (electronic
                  supplementary material, figures S5 and S7). Lastly, whereas the proximal tail
                  shows pronounced articulations between the zygapophyses, after approximately the
                  13th caudal this is no longer the case (electronic supplementary material, figure
                  S5). This shifts the rotational axes in the distal tail ventrally, towards the
                  vertebral centra, with the vertical position dependent on whether the tail is in
                  flexion or extension (electronic supplementary material, figure S6 shows the
                  baseline and two extreme possibilities). We, therefore, bounded the rotational
                  axes in tail segments 3 and 4, which affected joint springs 3–5. The dorsal axes
                  are unrealistically high, ensuring a wide bound for the sensitivity analysis. The
                  ventral axes are located at the vertebral articulation with the chevrons, and
                  represent their mechanical effect when the tail is flexed. In total, the
                  aforementioned bounds led to 11 different models. </p>
            <p> To encourage the adoption of our compliant tail model for dinosaur locomotion, we
                  have provided in-depth descriptions of reconstruction and biomechanical modelling
                  steps, mathematical derivations, scaling relationships and supplementary results
                  in a combined document titled ‘Supplementary texts’ as electronic supplementary
                  material. Reconstructions, 3D modelling and measurements were all done in
                  Rhinoceros 6 (McNeel and Associates, Seattle, WA, USA). The biomechanical model
                  was constructed using custom-code written in MATLAB 2019b (MathWorks, Natick, MA,
                  USA). A 3D model of the iliosacrum and caudal skeleton of RGM.792000, and all
                  custom MATLAB scripts are provided as electronic supplementary material. </p>
            <p>3. Results</p>
            <p> Natural frequencies and walking speeds determined in this study, as well as key
                  outcomes of the sensitivity analysis, are reported in table 1 . The natural
                  frequency of our baseline model of the tail was 0.66 s −1 , which we interpreted
                  as the preferred step frequency for <tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name> . This
                  corresponds to a PWS of 1.28 m s −1 . To provide the reader with an impression of
                  the dynamic behaviour that results, we have provided a simulation of a lightly
                  damped version of the baseline model (electronic supplementary material, video
                  S1). In this simulation, the only input to the tail was a sinusoidal motion at the
                  base of the tail with an amplitude of 0.08 m. Assuming pendular walking, this is
                  the vertical motion that results from taking 1.94 m long steps at a hip height of
                  3.1 m. No muscle forces were included, so the phase relationship between the
                  vertical oscillations of the hip and tail may not be representative of a
                  muscle-actuated tail. In this simulation, a small amount of damping was introduced
                  in order to obtain a finite tail amplitude. The damping ratio of the fundamental
                  eigenmode was 0.16, which has a negligible effect on the resonant frequency [ 43
                  ]. </p>
            <p> The effects of changes in length (and thus inertia), mass and strain are
                  mathematically predictable in our model, and we have thus derived general scaling
                  laws for these parameters in the electronic supplementary material. Mass had zero
                  effect on the natural frequency. Length ( L ) and strain in the horizontal
                  position ( εhor ) are related to the natural frequency ( fn ) as follows: fn ∝
                  L−0.5 and fn ∝ 1 hor— 0:5 . These relations can also be applied to the altered
                  moment arms or distal axes models. For instance, a 6% longer tail, with 10% more
                  strain in horizontal equilibrium (4.4% strain instead of 4%), using the maximal
                  moment arms, would lead to a natural frequency of 0.79 × 1.06 −0.5 × 1.1 −0.5 =
                  0.73 s −1 . The a These models only changed the moment arms within the 3rd – 5th
                  segments; segments 1 and 2 remained unchanged from the baseline model. moment arms
                  models cannot be combined with the distal axes models in this way, because these
                  models are based on measurements of morphological traits, instead of systematic
                  parameter variations. Their combinations are reported in electronic supplementary
                  material, table S2, and the above proportionality relations can be applied to
                  those combination effects as well. </p>

            <p>4. Discussion</p>
            <p> The primary goal of this study was to develop a reductionist method to estimate the
                  tail natural frequency of <tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name> , and to combine
                  the results of this method with trackway data for a baseline estimate of PWS (
                  table 1 ). Our secondary goal was to determine which morphological features of the
                  tail have the largest effect on its natural frequency, and these are represented
                  by all the other models in table 1 . Overall, results are most sensitive to
                  uncertainties regarding ligament composition and vertebral kinematics in the tail
                  of <tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name> , while being minimally sensitive to
                  length (and thus moment of inertia), and not affected by mass. </p>
            <p> Our model predicts several scaling laws which provide insight into the locomotion of
                        <tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name> (derivations are provided in the
                  electronic supplementary material). Natural frequency scales with the inverse
                  square root of tail length ( table 1 ). This implies an ontogenetic decrease in
                  step frequency, but an increase in PWS proportional to L0.5 . </p>
            <p> It has previously been proposed that the distal tail may act as a ‘dynamic
                  stabilizer’ [ 19 ]. Varying the distal rotational axes revealed that even though
                  the distal three segments accounted for only 14.5% of the total caudal mass, they
                  still had a meaningful effect on the natural frequency ( table 1 ). Our results
                  support the notion that the medio-distal tail plays an important role in overall
                  tail dynamics. Furthermore, the ventral axes model suggests that the chevrons
                  increase locomotor speed when the tail is in slight flexion, by increasing the
                  moment arm of the interspinous ligaments. Combining altered moment arms with
                  alternative rotational axes strengthened this effect (electronic supplementary
                  material, table S2). However, this table should be interpreted with caution
                  because the distal axes models do not represent axes that would have been used
                  throughout the whole step cycle. Instead, the rotational axes would migrate
                  ventrally during flexion, and dorsally during extension of the tail, which could
                  potentially be influenced by contraction of the epaxial and hypaxial musculature.
                  Thus, the bounds in electronic supplementary material, table S2 are
                  unrealistically wide, due to the assumptions underlying this table. Yet, to
                  acknowledge the uncertainties in dinosaur gait reconstruction, we used these as
                  the reported range in our result. </p>
            <p> Varying the amount of strain imposed on the ligaments in the horizontal posture (
                  εhor , expressed as a fraction) had a similar effect as varying the length: fn ∝ 1
                  hor— 0:5 . This is analogous to increasing or decreasing the stiffness at a
                  constant moment of inertia. Ligaments that are subject to high levels of strain
                  have increased energy-saving properties [ 39 ]. Our high-strain model displayed a
                  lower natural frequency, implying that selective pressures for higher PWS may
                  result in less energy-efficient locomotion, and vice versa. </p>
            <p> Our baseline model suggests a PWS of 1.28 m s −1 for <tp:taxon-name>T.
                        rex</tp:taxon-name> , which we interpret to be near its energetically
                  optimal walking speed. There are no extant analogues for tail-dependent obligate
                  bipedal locomotion, especially combined with such a heavy emphasis on elastic
                  storage. In fact, energetically optimal walking speed has only been measured in a
                  few species, so comparisons are limited to these studies. In the animal kingdom,
                  optimal walking speed is reported to be 1.0 m s −1 for ratites [ 3 ] (average of
                  the net and total MCOT) and elephants [ 5 ], 1.34–1.42 m s −1 for humans [1,2] and
                  1.25 m s −1 for horses [ 4 ], and these speeds are closely related to their
                  respective PWS. PWS for giraffes [ 38 ] (reported as ‘semi-selected’) and
                  migratory gnus and gazelles [ 48 ] have also been determined to lie close to this
                  range. This is a remarkably close distribution, especially given the wide range in
                  body size, shape and locomotor modes. Most of our estimates of <tp:taxon-name>T.
                        rex</tp:taxon-name> walking speed fall within this range, with two of them
                  only slightly exceeding it. </p>
            <p> Very little work has been done to directly investigate PWS of dinosaurs. Limb
                  natural frequencies have been used to estimate ‘comfortable walking speeds’ of
                  several sauropod taxa [ 10 ], and dynamic simulations were used to estimate PWS of
                        <tp:taxon-name>Argentinosaurus</tp:taxon-name> [ 49 ]. To our knowledge, no
                  such work has been done on theropods. Until now, most estimates for (submaximal)
                  dinosaur walking speeds are based on dynamic similarity (DS). Based on a
                  regression of predominantly mammalian walking data, Alexander proposed an equation
                  to estimate walking speed from trackways [ 23 ]. Of importance is the relative
                  stride length, defined as the ratio between the stride length and hip height. This
                  necessitates inferral of the hip height of the trackmaker, leading to
                  uncertainties in the estimate. Despite qualitatively similar scaling predictions,
                  our proposed NFM predicts lower speeds than trackway estimates using DS
                  [23,24,32,45,50]. Such trackway estimates are not strictly energetically optimal,
                  but we would expect them to tend towards the preferred speed if the sample of
                  trackways is large enough. For large theropods, estimates tend to range between 2
                  and 3 m s −1 , which is much higher than the narrow range reported for extant
                  animals. These higher speeds are commonly attributed to allometric effects
                  [23,24,32,45,50]. A large source of potential errors, however, lies in the
                  equation that relates relative stride length to walking speed, in which the step
                  frequencies are implicit [24,51]. Alexander himself noted the high variability in
                  his walking data, which leads to errors in speed estimates [ 51 ]. Not only is
                  this true for dinosaurs, but even for the walking speed of the animals (including
                  humans) on which the regression is based [ 10 ]. It has been shown that limb
                  natural frequencies provided better predictions for elephants and giraffes near
                  the preferred speed [ 10 ]. Near preferred speeds, DS consistently overestimated
                  walking speeds, but the accuracy of the predictions improved at speeds
                  substantially higher than the preferred speeds [ 10 ]. When compared to walking
                  speeds of extant animals in a variety of sizes and gaits, DS also appears to
                  overestimate the walking speed of bipedal dinosaurs. Neglecting tail dynamics may,
                  therefore, be one of the oversimplifications inherent to DS, when applied to the
                  inverted pendulum model of walking. </p>
            <p> Recent amendments have been proposed to improve DS-based estimations, either by
                  focusing on swing phase dynamics [ 52 ], or by incorporating taxon-specific
                  morphological parameters to reduce uncertainty [ 53 ]. The latter are of course
                  difficult to obtain from a fossilized trackway. Our method can help in this
                  regard, by providing a range of plausible step frequencies for any given taxon.
                  With this goal in mind, it would be most effective to estimate the natural
                  frequencies of taxa that are wellrepresented in the trackway record. That way, it
                  would be possible to combine step length data from several trackways, increasing
                  confidence that the average result should tend towards preferred (and therefore
                  optimal) gait. Unfortunately, this was not possible in the present study, because
                  large theropod trackways with reasonably close taxonomic proximity to
                        <tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name> are exceedingly rare [ 45 ]. Bipedal
                  dinosaurs seem to have preferred to walk at a relative stride length of 1.3, and
                  it has been suggested that this might have been energetically optimal [24,45].
                  This relation implicitly relates footprint length to stride length, by first
                  estimating hip height from footprint length, and also assumes leg kinematics are
                  known. Instead, we preferred to relate footprint length directly to stride length
                  from a trackway that could be ascribed to <tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name>
                  with reasonable certainty [ 45 ]. This ensures sufficient geometric similarity to
                  RGM.792000. The resulting step lengths differed by less than 4% from the suggested
                  preferred relative stride length. Whenever considering trackway data,
                  substrate-related uncertainties will prevent any straightforward interpretation
                  [53,54], although presumably, these would not affect tail natural frequency. </p>
            <p> DS does not incorporate MCOT, and therefore cannot be used to estimate PWS of
                  dinosaurs. Therefore, when estimating dinosaur foraging costs, researchers have
                  used DS to scale the walking speed [ 29 ], or even kept it at a constant 2 m s −1
                  for larger taxa [ 31 ]. However, methods to calculate MCOT are heavily dependent
                  on both speed and mass [ 28 ], so we suggest that any comparison of foraging costs
                  should use the PWS of the respective taxa as a starting point. This could be done
                  using the natural frequency of the legs [ 10 ], musculoskeletal simulations [ 49
                  ], or NFM as we propose it. </p>
            <p> To our knowledge, musculoskeletal simulation models have not been used to estimate
                  how MCOT varied with walking speed in <tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name> ,
                  although this has been done for <tp:taxon-name>Argentinosaurus</tp:taxon-name> [
                  49 ]. A simulation model requires estimation of joint rotational axes, body mass
                  and moment arms for both the musculature and the ligaments [27,30,34,41,49]. The
                  muscular reconstruction then provides further uncertainties in fibre composition
                  type and architecture, both of which would significantly influence power output.
                  Simulation studies have generally focused on maximal speed, and have contributed
                  to the consensus that a long flight phase for large theropods would be unlikely
                  [25,27,30,35]. However, the extensive muscular reconstructions often strongly
                  affect the biomechanical simulations [41,49]. The largest uncertainty in the
                  present study is related to the moment arms of the interspinous ligaments. This is
                  an encouraging finding, because their extent is well-bounded by the skeleton.
                  Essentially, one of the more certain parameters provides the most uncertainty.
                  Future research on in vivo vertebral kinematics, dynamics and ligament
                  compositions of crocodilian tails could reduce this uncertainty. Similarly
                  encouraging is that our results are minimally sensitive to estimates of
                  muscularity or inertial parameters in general. Indeed, when isolating mass as a
                  free parameter in our sensitivity analysis, we have shown that our predicted
                  speeds are unaffected by mass-estimates ( table 1 ). This is due to the assumption
                  that the ligaments could passively support the tail: adding muscle mass would make
                  the ligaments proportionately stiffer, leading to the same natural frequency (see
                  the scaling relationships in the electronic supplementary material). This
                  assumption mimics the adaptations that naturally would have occurred in the
                  connective tissue, to keep the tail horizontal as the animal gained mass
                  throughout its life. It has been shown that body mass does not affect PWS in
                  humans [ 1 ], and this is also in accordance with DS [ 23 ]. Minimal sensitivity
                  to muscular and inertial estimates implies that our inverse dynamic approach to
                  constructing a non-rigid tail could be incorporated into more sophisticated
                  hindlimb simulation models, without adding much to the overall uncertainty of the
                  result. This could have implications for maximal running speeds of large taxa like
                        <tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name> : maximum running speed was shown to
                  be limited by peak stresses on the limbs [ 30 ], but a compliant tail may serve to
                  reduce these stresses. </p>
            <p> Our method for walking speed estimation is meant to be a reductionist analysis, so
                  we have only incorporated the interspinous ligaments, since we expect their
                  mechanical effect to dominate overall tail dynamics. Natural frequencies play an
                  important role in animal locomotion [ 6 – 13 ], and NFM, therefore, provides a
                  reasonable starting point for investigating how the resonant properties of
                  dinosaur tails affect overall locomotion. However, in reducing the analysis to the
                  mechanics of a single structure, many of the complex interactions are ignored. For
                  instance, animals tune the frequencies of their segments through muscular
                  contractions [6,7]. <tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus rex</tp:taxon-name> could have
                  contracted its epaxial and hypaxial caudal musculature to add rotational stiffness
                  to the tail, which could be beneficial at higher speeds, for instance during a
                  pursuit. Our ventral axes model demonstrates a possibility in this regard: if
                        <tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name> were to keep its distal tail in slight
                  flexion, thereby migrating the rotational axes of the vertebrae to the
                  articulations with the chevrons, the overall natural frequency of the tail would
                  increase. </p>
            <p> Tail musculature could also be employed to enforce beneficial phase relationships
                  between vertical hip and tail oscillations. During walking, vertical oscillations
                  between withers and heads in most ungulates are out of phase, which provides them
                  with an energetic benefit [36–38,55]. This is theorized to be modulated by natural
                  frequencies of the neck segment [37,38], but there is an active component to this
                  behaviour as well [ 36 ]. This phase relationship reduces the losses incurred
                  during the step-to-step transitions, which are identified as major sources of
                  energy losses in inverted pendulum models of walking [ 56 ]. The implications of
                  energy storage are also further complicated by the serial elasticity in
                  musculotendon complexes: tendon stiffness can substantially impact the mechanical
                  work done by the muscle fibres [ 57 ]. Finally, the cost of cyclical muscle
                  contractions could also affect metabolic optima, depending on the task
                  requirements [16,17]. Such complex interactions would undoubtedly affect PWS, but
                  require extensive reconstructions of muscular contractile properties. Muscular
                  parameters currently provide the biggest uncertainty in most musculoskeletal
                  simulations of dinosaurs [41,49,58], so any investigation of these interactions
                  would require careful consideration. Inclusion of our compliant tail model into
                  fully actuated hindlimb simulations of <tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name> may
                  shed further light on how the unique tails of non-avian dinosaurs functioned
                  during locomotion. However, in such complex simulations, the intricacies of tail
                  dynamics may be overshadowed by the uncertainties regarding the contractile
                  properties of the muscles. </p>
            <p>We set out to develop a method that does not require assumptions regarding
                  contractile properties, so we accept that this limits the predictive power of our
                  method. Given the overall uncertainties we must deal with when investigating the
                  locomotion of extinct animals, we consider the simplicity of the method to be one
                  of its strengths. Provided the neck or tail posture was supported passively, our
                  method could be used to arrive at an estimate of the PWS of any sufficiently
                  complete dinosaur, without the need to estimate contractile properties.</p>
            <p>5. Conclusion</p>
            <p> Gait reconstruction of dinosaurs has numerous inherent uncertainties, and therefore
                  it is important to compare results from different methods, in an attempt to find a
                  convergent point. We have proposed a method based on reconstructing the natural
                  frequency of the vertical swaying of the tail, which we refer to as the Natural
                  Frequency Method. This method requires relatively few assumptions, which are
                  furthermore different assumptions to other methods. Our results for preferred
                  walking speed of <tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name> are lower than previous
                  estimations for large theropods, but more closely match the preferred walking
                  speeds of a variety of extant animals, regardless of gait pattern and body size.
                  This seems to call in question the oft-cited high walking performance of bipedal
                  dinosaurs due to their cursorial adaptations. Investigating vertebral kinematics
                  and ligament composition in extant archosaurian tails could further constrain
                  predictions based on our method, which could, in turn, be used to improve trackway
                  estimates and foraging costs. Using simple, yet well-established principles from
                  animal locomotion, the Natural Frequency Method provides an independent line of
                  evidence to explore the locomotion of non-avian dinosaurs. </p>
