# TDWG Mininimal Data Standards task group

The MIDS are used for specimen digitization. This might have an impact, or should at least taken into consideration when designing our [level-2 output](https://github.com/plazi/ggxml2taxpub-treatments/blob/main/taxpub%20levels.md#treatment-level-2)

The current draft of the MIDS specification can be found here: https://github.com/tdwg/mids/blob/working-draft/current-draft/MIDS-definition-v0.15-29Jul2021.md. For MIDS-1, the elements being proposed are as follows

The work on the MIDS-1 elements has been documented in GitHub as a Milestone for MIDS-1 here https://github.com/tdwg/mids/milestone/1
 
The aim for the next monthly meeting will be to finalise MIDS-1 and determine the steps towards publication and ratification. To help us achieve this, we are suggesting an additional meeting on Thursday 28 April at the same time. I hope you will be able to join us.
