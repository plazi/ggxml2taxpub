               were males (the mistaken female was a juvenile), and they were collected from “Porto-Novo”
               in

               , which is modern-day Porto-Novo, the capital city of

               represented 
               <i>T . pulverulenta</i>

               <i>D . pulverulentus</i>

               of 
               <i>D . boueti</i>
               have subcaudal counts (106 and 116) and TL/SVL ratios (0.25 and 0.28) that are most
               consistent with

               in West Africa. Because 
               <i>T . pulverulenta</i>
               does not seem to be a strict forest specialist (see Habitat below), and the Porto-Novo

               Gap, it is likely that the Gap is not a barrier to dispersal for this species. We

               described the coloration in great detail as chocolate brown above, yellow below, finely
               dotted everywhere. On each side, near the back, there was a large number (60– 70)
               of pale red spots that lacked dark edging and extended over 4–6 scales. Usually the
               spots on one side alternated with those on the other; sometimes they also were opposite
               to each other and in this case were connected to weak “Querbinden” [cross-ties] by
               bright red connecting strips that extended over the back. Usually there was a small
               black spot under each of these spots on the outermost tip of the corresponding ventral
               shields. The innumerable fine black points, with which the whole body was sown, were
               grouped on the abdominal shields on each side at the point where they bent over to
               rise sideways, to form a black spot, which in their succession looked like a black
               longitudinal band, whereby the narrow belly appeared delimited from the flanks. Head
               was brown and without black lines. Upper lip, lower lip, throat yellow, dotted with

               gray bands on the anterior third of the body that gradually diminished to form light
               gray patches on the posterior two-thirds of the body. The ventral surface of the head
               was white or cream, whereas the venter of the body was pinkish with numerous brown
               spots. Brown lines “commence”[ed] just before the middle of the body on each side
               of the ventrals, and continued along the edge of the ventrals to the tip of the tail.
