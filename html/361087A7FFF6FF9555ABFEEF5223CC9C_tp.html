               Summary description
               . Sponges are massive, erect club-shaped to lobate, or encrusting, with coarsely spinous
               surface. Color in life brownish yellow. On deck, the sponge becomes slimy and looses
               much of its organic tissue quickly, leaving a macerated skeleton of coarse spongin
               fibres. The consistency is compressible in life, but becomes rigid in preservation.
               Size of specimens up to 30 x 5 x 
               4 cm
               . The skeletal framework of the sponge is made up of coarse thick spongin fibres usually
               entirely filled with thin, vestigial mycalostyles. Foreign materials including sand
               grains or algal strands occurs in some of the fibres in some of the specimens but
               this is uncommon generally. The main fibres, with thickness varying from 
               100 µm
               to 
               1 mm
               depending on position in the sponge (thicker specimens have basal fibres much thicker
               than peripheral fibres) may be irregularly anastomosing by connecting thinner fibres
               (
               100–250 µm
               diameter). Surface skeleton is absent. Spicules mycalostyles, microscleres rare or
               absent. Mycalostyles, typically ‘hollow’, reduced in silica development, almost vestigial,
               with faintly swollen tyles often grooved or lobed, length variable, 104–280 x 
               1–7 µm
               . Anisochelae not found in tropical localities but two anisochelae of 
               19–23 µm
               were found in one of Wiedenmayer’s specimens from South East 
               Australia
               . Sigmas, only rarely observed, absent in tropical localities. Wiedenmayer found 8
               sigmas in one of his specimens from South East 
               Australia
               , thin, widely curved, with apices somewhat incurved, size 
               42–86 µm

               <i>Mycale (Arenochalina) imperfecta</i>
               . This species is purple in color and has abundant microscleres, including rosettes

               <i>Gelliodes setosa Keller, 1889</i>
               was a junior synonym of the present species. However, his reason for suggesting this
               comes from 
               <a href="#ref137151">Van Soest’s (1984)</a>
               discussion of the affinities of Caribbean 
               <i>Mycale laxissima ( Duchassaing &amp; Michelotti, 1864 )</i>
               , in which he suggested that Indonesian specimen ZMA Por. 01611 showed similarities
               with 
               <i>M. laxissima</i>
               . The ZMA specimen was identified by M. Burton as 
               <i>Mycale setosa ( Keller, 1889 )</i>
               , but here it is reassigned to 
               <i>Mycale (Arenochalina) imperfecta</i>
               (cf. above). The name was also used by 
               <a href="#ref131467">
                  Erpenbeck

               not conform to the

               of

               , a.o. because no anisochelae were mentioned by Keller. As stated above, we examined
               the 
               type
               ZMB 270, which conforms to

               <i>Esperella crassa Dendy, 1896</i>
               in his long list of assumed junior synonyms of the present species, perhaps because
               Dendy mentions the presence of small anisochelae of 
               16 µm
               . Other features, including a strong presence of sand and foreign material do suggest
               it could be a junior synonym. Likewise, 
               <i>Esperella rara Dendy, 1896</i>
               with the same sandy skeleton and small anisochelae, but in addition also trichodragmas,
               appears close if not conspecific with the present species. Both are technically outside
               our target region, so we refrain from giving summary descriptions. Of the latter species

               Our estimate for the global diversity of the subgenus is severely uncertain, due to
               the unsatisfactory state of morphological evidence for species distinction. We believe
               a rational number of species is approximately 15, but this is not much better than
               a ‘guess’. One of the vexing problems is the poor knowledge of several South East
               Australian ‘species’ alleged or suspected to belong to the subgenus. The global distribution
               of the numbers of species found in Marine Ecoregions (cf. 
               <a href="#ref136201">
                  Spalding

               , showing that the subgenus is absent in polar regions and most temperate waters.
               Its absence in the Mediterranean indicates it has a circum-tropical distribution with
               a likely South East Pacific origin.
