               <i>Nothobranchius nikiforovi</i>
               is distinguished from all other congeners, except 
               <i>N. eggersi</i>
               , by males presenting two phenotypes; the blue phenotype having a bright iridescent
               light blue to blue-green body, with narrow red-brown scale margins creating irregular
               reticulated pattern forming chevron-shaped crossbars on posteroventral portion of
               body and median fins light blue with red-brown dotted pattern; the red phenotype has
               a dark red head, light blue dorsal and anal fins proximally and medially, dark red
               distally, with dark red stripes parallel to the fin rays, and plain dark red caudal
               fin.

               <i>Nothobranchius nikiforovi</i>
               differs from 
               <i>N. eggersi</i>
               by male colour pattern: the blue phenotypes having median fins with dark grey distal
               portion, some of the rays of dorsal and anal fins with white tips only (vs. median
               fins light blue with distinct slender white distal band), the caudal fin lacking a
               spotted pattern (vs. dots arranged into irregular curved stripes); the red phenotype
               has a golden stripe between the nape and dorsal-fin origin (vs. light blue stripe),
               the dorsal and anal fin distal portion plain red and without light distal band (vs.
               with distinct narrow white distal band), the pelvic fin without distal band (vs. with
               distinct slender light blue to white distal band). Furthermore, it differs from 
               <i>N. eggersi</i>
               by the morphometric characters of having greater postorbital length of 49–55 % HL
               (vs. 42–48), and greater head width of 
               64–71 in

               The lower reaches of the Matandu drainage in south-eastern 
               Tanzania
               , where 
               <i>N . nikiforovi</i>
               occurs, has a unimodal rainfall pattern extending from November to April, inferring
               an annual mode of reproduction in this species. The mean annual rainfall decreases
               southwards along the coast and is around 
               1000 mm
               at the Matandu River (
               <a href="#ref10882">Hughes &amp; Hughes 1992</a>
               ). Wetlands are at their lowest levels in August to September, when seasonal streams
               and most temporary habitats are dry.
               </p>
            <p id="d1e200">
               The type locality is a small temporary pool formed in the drainage of the seasonal
               Zinga River, a tributary of the Matandu River (
               <a href="#fig-13--151-250-1980-2004-">Fig. 5</a>
               ). The habitat belongs to category 2.1.1 as defined by 
               <a href="#ref12713">Watters (2014)</a>
               , representing ditches and excavated or eroded depressions associated with culverts
               along roads traversing the floodplain. At the end of the rainy season, the habitat
               was a shallow pool, about 
               10 m
               long and less than 
               5 m
               wide, and less than 
               1 m
               at the deepest point. At the type locality, all sampling took place in the same general
               habitat. The water was turbid, the bottom of the pool was not visible. Accompanying
               congeners consisted of 
               <i>N . cf. melanospilus</i>
               . No water quality determinations were made at the time of collection of the type
               specimens. However, the second author, when visiting the 
               paratype
               locality on 
               June 7, 1997
               during the mid-afternoon, determined the following water conditions: pH = 7.8, total
               dissolved solids = 440 ppm, temperature = 26 °C.

               Conservation status.
               <i>Nothobranchius nikiforovi</i>
               is recommended to be listed as Vulnerable. The species is currently known from four
               sites, belonging to three threat-based locations. The species might exist at some
               other sites within the drainages associated with the lower Matandu but its distribution
               will remain restricted and any potential additional populations are expected to be
               fragmented. The extent of occurrence is expected to be less than 
               5,000 km
               ² and the maximum number of threat-based locations is estimated as ten. Using IUCN
               version 3.1 (2012), the species meets the criteria B1ab(iii) for Vulnerable.
               </p>
            <p id="d1e221">
               The increasing pressure on land and water resources of wetlands will continue to result
               in habitat degradation and represent and important threat to the species, raising
               vulnerability in terms of conservation status. In combination with its seasonal life
               cycle in ephemeral habitats, its dependence on the clay-rich vertisol-type substratum
               for embryonic development makes the species more exposed to threats (
               <a href="#ref12955">Nagy &amp; Watters 2020</a>
               ).
               </p>
            <p id="d1e226">No conservation measures are in place for this species, and it is not known from any
               protected areas. There is a need for improved habitat protection at the locations
               where the species is known to occur. Additional surveys targeting suitable habitats
               should be conducted in the region in order to better understand the geographic distribution
               of this species and to elaborate the appropriate measures of conservation.</p>

               Biology.
               Aquarium maintenance of selected specimens was undertaken for observation of breeding
               behaviour and biology. 
               <i>Nothobranchius nikiforovi</i>
               has an annual mode of reproduction, typical of the genus. Eggs are deposited in the
               habitat substrate, where they survive the dry season and hatch with the onset of the
               wet season. Under captive conditions, peat moss was used successfully as an artificial
               spawning substrate. An embryonic development period of three to four months was observed
               at a temperature of about 22–24 °C.
