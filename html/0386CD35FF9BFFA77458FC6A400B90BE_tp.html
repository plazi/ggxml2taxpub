            <p id="d1e108">Small to large diplurid spiders. Eyes: present, on a common tubercle. Fovea: transverse,
               recurved. Labium: subquadrate, with few, or no cuspules. Sternum: three pairs of sigillae,
               all submarginal. Chelicerae: one row of ventral conical teeth on promargin. Maxillae:
               longer than wide with short anterior lobe bearing a serrula. Maxillary lyra: absent.
               Claws on pedipalp tarsi: with a single row of teeth in juveniles and females. Leg
               tarsi: aspinose; dorsally with a zig-zag row of trichobothria, metatarsi with one
               row of trichobothria, no trichobothria in proximal third of metatarsi; scopuliform
               setae present on anterior tarsi and metatarsi. Tarsal claws of legs: paired tarsal
               claws with a double row of teeth; unpaired claws of leg tarsi with teeth very short,
               or absent. Spinnerets: PLS elongated, with digitiform apical segment. Cymbium: equally
               bilobate, scopulate and aspinose. Palpal organ: pyriform with small subtegulum. Males
               with megaspine at retroventral apex of tibia I; metatarsus I with MP in 1:3B.</p>

               The collections of IBSP and MNRJ were destroyed in fires of 2010 and 2018, respectively.
               The MNRJ collection was reviewed by Silva-Moreira 
               et al.
               (2010), who were unable to locate many of the relevant 
               types

               Unfortunately, the loan request on 
               holotypes
               to NHRS was rejected by QCAZ for all species described by 
               <a href="#ref24415">Dupérré &amp; Tapia (2015)</a>
               and, additionally, it was not possible to arrange a loan on any of the other types.
               N. Dupérré provided images and confirmed a “weak” scopula with “[…] two parallel lines”
               for all described species (pers. comm.).

            <p id="d1e137">As mentioned by Ríos-Tamayo &amp; Goloboff (2012), it seems common for mygalomorphs with
               many spermathecal lobes, or processes to often show minor differences in the number
               or shape of lobes and processes of both sides. Presumably, lobes and processes with
               thin, weak ducts may easily get broken during moults, producing minor differences
               in successive moults of the adult female. Our research presented here suggests the
               same applies to vesicles.</p>
