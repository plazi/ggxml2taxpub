               <i>Toxicodryas blandingii</i>
               was originally described by Hallowell (1845:170) based on a single specimen collected
               by his friend, “Dr. Blanding,” in 
               Liberia
               . The dorsum and venter of the specimen was noted to have a “light yellow” color with
               a series of blotches of “leaden colour.” This specimen reportedly possessed 2 preoculars,
               2 postoculars, 272 ventrals, 131 subcaudals, body length (i.e., SVL) of 1.22 meters,
               and tail length of 0.39 meters. 
               <a href="#ref30165">Hallowell (1854)</a>
               provided additional details of the specimen’s teeth, noted it had 17 “rows of scales,”
               and corrected the tail length to 0.37 meters.

               reported by Hallowell (1845) in the original description, but the longer measurement
               is likely a typographical error in reference to the latter citation (V. Wallach, pers.
               comm.). A query by EG to the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences in spring 2020 resulted

               According to 
               <a href="#ref32014">Loveridge (1957:269)</a>
               , the name 
               <i>Dipsas Fischeri</i>
               was proposed by Jan (in 
               <a href="#ref29038">Duméril 1859</a>
               ) to combine the minor color pattern variants 
               <i>Dipsas fasciata</i>
               , 
               <i>D . valida</i>
               , and 
               <i>D . globiceps</i>
               named by 
               <a href="#ref29308">Fischer (1856)</a>
               . 
               <a href="#ref33796">Pel (1852:171)</a>
               coined the name 
               <i>Dipsas regalis</i>
               , and as translated by 
               <a href="#ref35380">Savage &amp; McDiarmid (2017:73)</a>
               , Pel stated, “the third species of venomous snake, 
               <i>Naja atropos</i>
               , belongs to cobras (spectacled snakes) and reaches a length of 
               6 to 7 feet
               [
               1.8–2.1 m
               ]. Its color is entirely black... As this snake in general shows much similarity to
               a tree snake, 
               <i>Dipsas regalis</i>
               , which equals it in color and size, but is not venomous.” Perhaps because of this
               poor description, 
               <a href="#ref26812">Boulenger (1896:78)</a>
               attributed the latter name to 
               <a href="#ref30749">Jan &amp; Sordelli (1870</a>
               –1881), who provided an illustration that served as an appropriate description. Jan
               listed the name in the 
               Index des Planches
               for Livraison 38 as 
               <i>Dipsas cynodon Cuv.</i>
               variété? (
               <i>D . regalis Schlegel</i>
               ), but according to 
               <a href="#ref35380">Savage &amp; McDiarmid (2017:73)</a>
               , the attribution to Hermann Schlegel is in error because he never used the name in
               any publication. 
               <a href="#ref32936">Müller (1885:687)</a>
               seemed to suggest that Jan illustrated his specimen (collected by Dr. Mähly from “Goldküste”
               [i.e., 
               Gold Coast
               or modern-day

               <a href="#ref30630">Hughes &amp; Barry (1969:1020)</a>
               listed a personal communication from M.S. Hoogmoed, who noted the

               of 
               <i>D . regalis</i>
               (specimen “Leiden 958”) was collected by Pel in

               coined the genus 
               <i>Toxicodryas</i>
               because he noticed that his specimen of 
               <i>T . blandingii</i>
               had a “single channelled posterior tooth on each side... and therefore...[it] cannot
               belong to the genus Triglophodon [sic] of Dum. and Bibron, which has three.” Subsequent
               herpetological publications in the 19

               and early 20

               <a href="#ref35449">Schmidt (1923)</a>
               transferred the taxon to the genus

               at 
               2 P.
               M. in the afternoon, and shortly thereafter, it regurgitated a “freshly swallowed”
               bat, suggesting the snake was preying upon roosting bats during the day.

               noted that, in captivity, an adult female from 
               Liberia
               was active during the day, whereas an adult male of uncertain origin was mostly nocturnal.
               The latter author also noted that “a number of authors” have described the constricting
               behavior of

               and controlled with loops of the snake’s body. The former author noticed that captive
               snakes prefer to feed in low light or complete darkness, suggesting nocturnal habits.

               onto a lawn. The snake was caught for the purpose of photography. It had apparently
               swallowed two smaller prey, and bats peeped excitedly from the hollow roof. The animal
               was carefully photographed for about ten minutes, remaining calm and not attempting
               to bite. Suddenly it opened its mouth and froze all movements. It couldn’t be made
               to move again. Even turning on its back did not lead to any reaction, and the snake
               remained motionless, as if dead, with its mouth wide open. Slight movements of the
               trachea could be registered.
