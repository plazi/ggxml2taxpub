               4.7 mm
               . Body oblong, uniform reddish brown, dorsal surface dull, except setae of lateral
               margins of pronotum and elytra nearly glabrous, labroclypeus, tarsi, and tibiae shiny.

               Labroclypeus wide and subtrapezoidal, widest at base; anterior angles strongly convex,
               anterior margin nearly straight medially; lateral margins slightly convex and convergent
               anteriorly, producing with ocular canthus a blunt angle, not incised at transition
               to labrum; margins strongly reflexed; surface shiny and flat, coarsely and very densely
               punctate, partly punctures fusing with each other, with a number of very large punctures
               each bearing a single erect seta; frontoclypeal suture finely incised, weakly curved;
               smooth area in front of eyes twice as wide as long; ocular canthus moderately long
               and wide, finely and densely punctate, with a single terminal seta. Frons dull, finely
               and sparsely punctate, near interior margin of eyes and behind lateral frontoclypeal
               suture with a few single long setae. Eyes large, ratio diameter/ interocular width:
               0.77. Antenna with ten antennomeres, club with three antennomeres, 1.7 times as long
               as remaining antennomeres combined. 
               Mentum
               convexly elevated, flattened anteriorly.
               </p>
            <p id="d1e74">Pronotum widest at middle, lateral margins evenly convex and moderately convergent
               anteriorly and posteriorly, anterior angles moderately sharp and distinctly produced,
               posterior angles blunt; anterior margin with fine marginal line and convexly produced
               medially, basal margin without marginal line; surface finely and densely punctate,
               with microscopic setae in punctures, otherwise glabrous. Scutellum triangular, finely
               and moderately densely punctate, punctures less dense at middle, with microscopic
               setae in punctures.</p>
            <p id="d1e76">Elytra elongate, widest in posterior third; striae finely impressed and sparsely punctate,
               intervals convex, finely and sparsely punctate, punctures concentrated along striae
               and with a few single, short setae on penultimate lateral interval, otherwise glabrous;
               epipleural margin robust, ending at moderately rounded external apical angle of elytra;
               epipleura with long and dense setae; apex of elytra membraneous, with a wide rim of
               microtrichomes.</p>
            <p id="d1e78">Ventral surface dull, with moderately dense and coarse punctures, sparsely setose,
               with a dense erect setae on meso-and metasternum, otherwise only with microscopic
               setae in punctures. Mesosternum between mesocoxae slightly wider than mesofemur. Ratio
               of length of metepisternum/ metacoxa: 1/ 2.0. Metacoxa with a few robust setae laterally.
               Abdominal sternites dull, with sparse and very fine punctation and a row of coarse
               punctures each bearing a robust seta; penultimate sternite with a wide shiny and chitinous
               rim. Pygidium dull, strongly convex, coarsely and densely punctate, without impunctate
               midline, apically with a few longer setae, otherwise only with microscopic setae.</p>
            <p id="d1e81">Legs moderately long and moderately wide; femora nearly impunctate, with two longitudinal
               rows of setae. Metafemur dull, very finely and superficially punctate, anterior margin
               acute, without adjacent serrated line; posterior ventral margin almost straight, moderately
               widened in apical half, posterior margin not serrated ventrally nor dorsally. Metatibia
               moderately wide and long, widest at middle, weakly narrowed basally, ratio width/
               length: 1/ 3.46, sharply carinate dorsally, with two groups of spines, basal one shortly
               before middle, apical one at three quarters of metatibial length; lateral face longitudinally
               convex, with moderately dense and fine punctures basally and dorsally, otherwise nearly
               impunctate, punctures with microscopic setae only; ventral margin with four equidistant
               strong spines; medial face smooth and glabrous, apex very shallowly emarginate interiorly
               near tarsal articulation. Tarsomeres impunctate dorsally, with dense, fine setae ventrally,
               circular in cross-section; metatarsomeres impunctate dorsally, with a strongly serrated
               ventral carina, subventrally with a second, smooth longitudinal carina; metatarsomeres
               glabrous ventrally, first metatarsomere distinctly shorter than following two tarsomeres
               combined and slightly longer than dorsal tibial spur. Protibia moderately long, bidentate,
               external margin weakly convex. All claws symmetrical, feebly curved and long, with
               normally developed basal tooth.</p>
