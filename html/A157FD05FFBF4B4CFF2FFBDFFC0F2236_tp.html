               <i>Sciaridae</i>
               , but are easily distinguished from them by the absence of a narrow eye bridge and

               <i>Penthetria</i>
               have R 
               2+3

               ) and that the form of R 
               2+3
               is essentially evaluated by gestalt rather than any discrete measurement, the extant
               species can typically be distinguished in this way with confidence.

               <a href="#fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">Figs. 21–22</a>
               , 
               <i>Penthetria</i>
               can be defined by the slope of R 
               2+3
               less than 0.43 and 
               <i>Plecia</i>
               by the slope of R 
               2+3
               greater than 0.74 (slope defined here as rise/run, where rise = measure of imaginary
               line between points y and z, and where run = measurement of imaginary line between
               points x and z (see 
               <a href="#fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">Fig. 22b</a>
               )). However, when slope is applied to the continuum of the form of R 
               2+3
               found in fossil species, it is not as clear. For example, if slope is measured for
               the 15 
               <i>Plecia</i>
               and 15

               <a href="#ref36689">Skartveit &amp; Nel (2017)</a>
               , with a line discriminating 
               <i>Plecia</i>
               with slope&gt;= 0.50, it would correctly assign alone 27 of the 30 wings (i.e., without
               evaluating any other aspect of morphology). More variation should be studied before
               determining whether such a definition could be employed, but utilizing a discrete
               definition of slope and understanding the breadth of variation in the form of R 
               2+3
               (or other veins) of extant species would undoubtably help to objectify the generic
               placement of fossil taxa.

               <i>Plecia</i>
               are much more complex, show great interspecific variability (see e.g., 
               <a href="#ref33819">Hardy 1945</a>
               , 
               <a href="#ref33025">Fitzgerald 1998</a>
               ) and tend to have the tubular, gonostyus-socket-portion of the gonocoxite greatly
               shortened. However, this is less true in fossil specimens. As 
               <a href="#ref36689">Skartveit and Nel (2017)</a>
               point out, the male terminalia of some fossil 
               <i>Plecia</i>
               are very plesiomorphic and 
               <i>Penthetria</i>
               -like (e.g., see 
               <a href="#ref32489">

               Additionally, 
               <i>Penthetria</i>
               has subtle parapsidal sutures (longitudinal sutures on the mesonotum corresponding
               to the position of dorsocentral setae), while they are often present as distinct grooves
               in 
               <i>Plecia</i>
               . Females of the two genera can be also be distinguished by 
               <i>Penthetria</i>
               having two segmented-cerci and 
               <i>Plecia</i>
               with one-segmented cerci—though some fossil 
               <i>Plecia</i>

               <i>P. clavifemur Skartveit 2009</i>

               It is also noteworthy that

               and the bibionid genus 
               <i>Hesperinus</i>

               <a href="#ref36439">Skartveit 2009</a>
               ), which is critical in situations where the fossil specimen is represented only by
               a preserved wing. In fossils where more than the wing has been preserved, 
               <i>Penthetria</i>
               has shorter antennae, with more compact flagellomeres and tends to be more stout-bodied,
               with shorter legs than 
               <i>Hesperinus</i>
               . Additionally, males of 
               <i>Penthetria</i>
               are typically holoptic while both sexes of 
               <i>Hesperinus</i>

               Adult
               : Small to moderately large flies 4.0-11.0 mm. Head: Male head dorsoventrally compressed;
               in dorsal view, slightly wider than long, oval-shaped. Head and antennae black to
               brown. Male with almost entire dorsal surface of head occupied by broadly holoptic
               compound eye (
               <a href="#fig-4--151-250-1982-2006-">Fig. 1</a>
               ), except 
               <i>P. funebris</i>
               , with compound eyes narrowly separated dorsally by longitudinal strip of frons approximately
               subequal in width to antennal flagellum. Male compound eye strongly divided into larger
               dorsal region and smaller ventral region; dorsal region usually lighter in color than
               ventral region and with larger ommatidia. Division between dorsal and ventral regions
               of compound eye often distinguished by distinct narrow longitudinal step (the dorsal
               region of the eye is often taller than the ventral region of the eye; where the dorsal
               and ventral regions meet laterally, a short step, curb, or groove is often visible

               depression dividing compound eye, but lacking any difference in size of ommatidia
               or color between dorsal and ventral regions. Compound eye of both sexes bare or clothed
               with minute, stiff, or very elongate hairs. Ocellar tubercle well developed and prominent
               in males, moderately to weakly developed in females. Both sexes with three ocelli
               arranged in small, equilateral triangle. Female with small tubercle or longitudinal
               ridge just posterior to antennal sockets. Male frons reduced to small, triangular
               region between anterior margin of compound eye, posterior margin of antennal sockets
               bearing minute tubercle (or a minute pit in 
               <i>P. funebris</i>

               located anteriorly along oral margin, with 7–10 short, stout flagellomeres. Flagellomeres
               slightly broader than long, except most basal flagellomere, about two times as long
               as subsequent flagellomere. Pedicel and flagellomeres with subapical ring of short
               setae and numerous dense, minute, appressed setae. Apical flagellomere slightly more

               with five segments; basal segment minute, third segment thickened with dorsal, diagonal
               sensory pit with dense, minute, specialized setae; apical palpomere slender, more

               Anepisternum bare or with cluster of hairs at posterior margin. Meron, laterotergite,
               and mediotergite bare. Female thoracic pleura generally less hairy than male. Legs:
               Legs black to dark brown. All legs with five tarsomeres, simple tarsal claws, pulvilli
               and pulvilliform empodia. Anterior coxa short and not reaching ventral edge of katepisternum;
               reaching about half length of katepisternum in lateral view, usually with elongate
               hair. Fore femur relatively slender and more elongate; not short and swollen. Fore
               tibia elongate, slender, apex unmodified, outer edge not developed into a mucron.
               Fore tibia distally with a single, short spur. Middle legs unremarkable; with two
               apical tibial spurs. Hind legs with hind femur swollen apically to more slender and
               only slightly enlarged apically. Hind tibia slender or swollen apically. Inner surface
               of hind tibia without elongate field of small, round, black, specialized sensilla.
               Spurs of hind tibia slender, apically acute, subequal in length, or ventral spur slightly
               more elongate than dorsal spur. In males, hind tarsomeres vary in shape, from slender,

               Intraspecific Variation
               . While the general form of 
               <i>Penthetria</i>
               species is remarkably homogeneous (most species look very similar to 
               <a href="#fig-4--151-250-1982-2006-">Fig. 1</a>
               ), there is considerable intraspecific variation that makes identification and species
               delimitation challenging. Some of the characters that have been previously used to
               help distinguish species, such as whether vein R 
               2+3
               has an appendix at the base (
               <a href="#ref33819">Hardy 1945</a>
               ), have been found to be variable (pers. obs.) and not consistently present or absent
               within a given species (e.g., 
               <i>P. appendicula</i>
               typically but not always has an appendix (
               <a href="#fig-11--151-264-1518-1542-">Fig. 2</a>
               , ba), 
               <i>P. distincta</i>
               generally does not but may have an appendix, and 
               <i>P. neonigrita</i>
               usually does not but rarely does have an appendix). Additionally, some species have
               a tendency to have CuA and CuP meeting apically near the wing margin forming a closed
               cell cua (
               <a href="#fig-29--151-264-1324-1348-">Fig. 32</a>
               ), yet this character is not consistent when numerous specimens are studied. In some
               cases, one wing will have a closed cell cua and the other wing has an open cell (pers.
               obs). Plasticity in the wing venation (e.g., presence/absence of an appendix on R
               
               2+3
               , length of stem of M, and position of r-m crossvein) has also been noted in some
               of the Palearctic species (
               <a href="#ref35546">Nartshuk 1990</a>
               , 
               <a href="#ref34730">Krivosheina &amp; Krivosheina 1998</a>
               ). Unfortunately, the strong plasticity of the wing venation observed in extant taxa
               does not bode well for the taxonomy of fossil members of the group, since many species
               have been delimited largely or solely on differences in wing veins. For example, the
               slope and length of vein R 
               2+3
               has been used to help delimit both extant and fossil species. The study of the intraspecific
               variation of this character in extant species indicates that vein R 
               2+3
               can vary drastically in slope and length even between specimens of the same species
               collected from sites that are relatively near each other (e.g., 
               <a href="#fig-24--151-264-1285-1309-">Figs. 21</a>
               a–b). Concerns about how the intraspecific variation found in the wing venation of
               extant species of bibionids translates into the delimitation of fossil species was
               previously raised by 
               <a href="#ref32489">

                  </a>
               . His study noted the plasticity of the length and shape of r-m in 
               <i>Bibio Geoffroy</i>
               , the slope and length of R

               in 
               <i>Penthetria</i>
               and arrived at the conclusion that male terminalia were the best source of information
               for delimiting fossil species (which mirrors conclusions by those working on extant
               taxa). It is possible that the number of fossil species of 
               <i>Penthetria</i>
               (and possibly other genera) have been artificially inflated due to variable wing venation
               described under several names.Additional examples of intraspecific variation in the
               genus can also be found under “ 
               <i>P. heteroptera (Say)</i>
