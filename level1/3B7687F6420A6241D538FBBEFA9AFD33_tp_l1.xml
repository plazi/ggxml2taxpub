         <p>VENTRAL DISC. Gonads restricted to the disc. Ventral interradii with spines. Scales on ventral interradii covering the whole area of an interradius. The number of scales on H line of an interradius about 14–21. Ventral teeth single. Infradental papillae on oral plate present. Buccal scales on OP present. Accessory oral papillae on OP absent. Lateral oral papillae on OP present; single row of lateral papillae; rounded and spiniform. Adoral shield spine present. Lyman’s ossicle present. Oral shield covering less than one third of interradius; about as long as wide. Madreporite no data. Adoral shield meeting in front of the oral shield. Abradial genital plate twisted. Number of genital slits one per bursa. Genital slit longer than half the length of an interradius. Genital papillae absent. Dental plate dorsal half widest; entire (single plate). Dental sockets slit-shaped and circular; equal to or more than 50% of the width. At least one socket on DP as depression or perforation without septum. Teeth flat (with round or slightly pointed tip, but never spine-like). Teeth on DP arranged as single row.</p>
