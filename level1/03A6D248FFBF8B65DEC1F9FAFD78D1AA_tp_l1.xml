Notes on 
type
material

</p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
. According to the original description, the 
lectotype
and 
paralectotypes
from the 
Philippines
were collected from 
Bohol
, 
Manila
(Luzon) and 
Zamboanga
(Mindanao). However, they are all mixed together in the same jar and nothing allows us to assign them to 
Bohol
, 
Manila
or 
Zamboanga
. Thus, the type locality is simply “ 
Philippines
”. The 
lectotype
is selected because it is well preserved and was dissected for the present study (all internal organs remain in the specimen); the anatomy of the 
lectotype
matches perfectly the characters observed in our recently-collected material (retractor muscle inserting at the posterior end of the visceral cavity, penis almost as long as the visceral cavity, intestinal loops of type II, deferent duct attached to the surface of the oviduct and tightly coiled with many U-turns). All other 
syntypes
become 
paralectotypes
. All six 
paralectotypes
(30/22 to 23/ 
16 mm
) from the 
Philippines
(
ZMB
/Moll 39028b) were dissected previously, likely by Semper himself or 
Plate (1893)
. Three of these 
paralectotypes
(30/22, 28/28 and 23/ 
16 mm
) are missing most of the reproductive and digestive systems, but parts of the oviduct, intestine and rectal gland remain; one 
paralectotype
(23/ 
16 mm
) corresponds to only the left half of a slug with some organs remaining; two 
paralectotypes
(27/26 and 20/ 
16 mm
) were previously dissected but all organs remain. The large (22/ 
10 mm
) 
paralectotype
from 
Singapore
(
ZMB
/Moll 39030) was previously dissected and its penial apparatus is missing; the notum of a small (20/ 
17 mm
) 
paralectotype
from 
Singapore
(
ZMB
/Moll 39030) was cut open for the present study to check several characters. The 
paralectotype
(27/ 
25 mm
) from Penang (
ZMB
/Moll 39029) was previously dissected and the penial complex is missing; the deferent duct in its posterior reproductive system is not attached to the oviduct, indicating that this 
paralectotype
is not part of the species described here but, instead, is a misidentification of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
. Semper (1882: 272) also mentioned some material (likely only one specimen) collected in Brisbane (Queensland, 
Australia
) which could not be located. While 
Queensland
is part of the geographic distribution of the species described here, that material from Brisbane could belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Finally, Semper (1882: 272) mentioned two specimens from “des Wiener Museums” (the Vienna Museum) but from an unknown locality. Due to the presence of at least two species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
in the type material (certainly 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
, and possibly 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
; see Remarks for more details), it is necessary to designate a 
lectotype
to clarify the application of the name 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Onchidella condoriana
</tp:taxon-name>
. The radula, the penial complex and most of the posterior (female) reproductive parts were all previously removed and are missing from the 
holotype
. Some parts remain though (digestive gland, intestine, oviduct of the posterior reproductive parts). It is unclear how many specimens were used by 
Rochebrune (1882)
for the original description, but only one specimen is present at the 
MNHN
and it is regarded as the 
holotype
(there is no evidence suggesting that Rochebrune examined more than one specimen).
</p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Oncis semperi
</tp:taxon-name>
. Both 
syntypes
were previously emptied of all their internal organs, likely by Plate himself. Two stomachs and some pieces of digestive glands remain in the jar but the type of intestinal loops could not be checked. Plate’s description of intestinal loops of type I (
Plate 1893
) is inconsistent with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
but it was most likely a mistake (see our remarks below). The designation of a 
lectotype
would be pointless because the two 
syntypes
are externally similar and it is unclear whether Plate’s description was mostly based on the largest specimen or both specimens.

Description
</p>
      <p>
Color and morphology of live animals
(
Fig. 11
)
</p>
      <p>
Live animals are not usually covered with mud, and their natural color can be observed without washing. The dorsal notum is typically dark brown, dark grey or black and often has some lighter brown longitudinal bands or mottling. The dorsal surface is typically bumpy, granular and not smooth. The color of the hyponotum in unit #1 (from Peninsular 
Malaysia
to 
China
and Sulawesi) is grey or blue-grey, or occasionally light grey (
Fig. 11
J–K), while in unit #2 (
Philippines
) it is generally dark grey or dark blue (
Fig. 11
D–E). The margin of the hyponotum may be bright white, which is especially common in unit #2. No specimens or pictures of the hyponotum were available for unit #3 from 
China
or 
Japan
(only a photo of the dorsal notum was published by 

Takagi 
et al
. 2019

). The foot is light yellow in units #1 and #2. The ocular tentacles are frequently retracted when animals are observed in the field, but extended ocular tentacles are brown and short (up to 
4 mm
long). Inferior to the ocular tentacles, superior to the mouth, the head bears a pair of oral lobes. On each oral lobe, there is an elongated bump or protuberance, likely with sensitive receptors.
</p>
      <p>
Dorsal gills are absent. Papillae with dorsal eyes are present. The exact number of papillae bearing dorsal eyes is variable (between 20 and 
68 in
unit #1 and between 17 and 
45 in
unit #2), with the largest animals bearing the largest numbers of eyes. The number of eyes on each papilla is one. The dorsal eyes are distributed across the notum but are absent on the margin (are never &lt;
2 mm
from the notum edge).
</p>
      <p>
External morphology
(
Fig. 12
A–C)
</p>
      <p>
The notum is oval and the body is dorso-ventrally flattened (
Fig. 12A
). The foot is narrow in proportion to the hyponotum and is approximately ¼ to ⅓ of the total width. The anus is posterior, median, close to the edge of the pedal sole. The pneumostome is median and is near the anus (closer to the anus than to the posterior margin of the hyponotum) (
Fig. 12C
). On the right side (to the left in ventral view), a peripodial groove is present at the junction between the pedal sole and the hyponotum, running longitudinally from the buccal area to the posterior end and ending with the female opening. The female opening is approximately 
1 to 3 mm
from the anus in most individuals but may be up to 
6 mm
away in large specimens (observed in unit #1). The male aperture is below the ocular tentacles, almost centered between them, but slightly to the right side (
Fig. 12B
).
</p>
      <p>
Visceral cavity and pallial complex
</p>
      <p>The heart is enclosed in the pericardium, on the right side of the visceral cavity, slightly posterior to the middle. The large, anterior ventricle becomes a large aorta that branches into smaller vessels delivering blood to the visceral organs. The auricle, significantly smaller than the ventricle, is posterior. The pericardium communicates through a small hole with the right portion of the renal-pulmonary complex. The kidney is intricately attached to the pulmonary cavity, which is slightly asymmetrical, the right part being slightly larger than the left part.</p>
      <p>
Digestive system
(
Figs 2B, H
, 
13–17A
)
</p>
      <p>
There is no jaw. The left and right salivary glands have numerous branches and join the buccal mass dorsally on either side of the esophagus. The radula is located between two large posterolateral muscular masses. Radulae measure up to 
6.1 mm
in length (unit #1) and 
4.7 mm
(unit #2). Each radular row contains a central rachidian tooth and two, left and right, half rows of lateral teeth. Examples of radular formulae are presented in 
Table 5
. The half rows of lateral teeth form an angle of 45° with the rachidian axis. The rachidian teeth are unicuspid: a median cusp is always present; there are no distinct lateral cusps (
Figs 13A
, 
14A
). The lateral aspect of the base of the rachidian teeth is straight (neither concave nor convex). The length of the cusp of each rachidian tooth is approximately 
15–35 µm
, significantly smaller than that of the lateral teeth. The hook of the lateral teeth is extended posteriorly by a tail-like structure attaching to the radular membrane and making the hook look longer. The tail-like structure (posterior hook extension, 
Fig. 13D
) is most noticeable in the outermost lateral teeth. The lateral teeth are unicuspid with a flattened hook. The tip of the hook may be rounded or pointed, which varies between individuals and even within a particular radula. Lateral teeth are approximately 
35 to 75 µm
long, and their length gradually increases along the half row, excluding the few innermost lateral teeth and outermost lateral teeth which are significantly smaller (
Fig. 13B, D
). The lateral teeth bear an outer pointed spine on the lateral expansion of the base. In most cases, the basal lateral spine cannot be observed because it is hidden below the hook of the adjacent lateral tooth. It can only be observed when the teeth are not too close together or when the teeth are turned in an unusual position (
Fig. 13
E–F). The inner lateral aspect of the hook of the lateral teeth is not straight. It is marked by a moderate protuberance placed over the inner adjacent tooth. That protuberance is slight and rounded (not pointed) and makes the inner aspect of the hook look wavy. The protuberance diminishes in the outermost teeth, and, as a result, their lateral aspect is almost straight.

The esophagus, narrow and straight, enters the stomach anteriorly. The stomach is located on the left, dorsal side of the visceral mass. In dorsal view, only a portion of the stomach can be seen because it is partly covered by the lobes of the digestive gland. The dorsal lobe is mainly on the right. The left, lateral lobe is mainly ventral. The posterior lobe covers the posterior aspect of the stomach. The stomach is a U-shaped sac divided into four chambers (
Fig. 15
C–D). The first chamber, just distal to the esophagus, is delimited by a thin layer of tissue, and receives the ducts of the dorsal and left lateral lobes of the digestive gland. The second chamber is delimited by a thick, muscular layer of tissue and receives the duct of the posterior lobe of the digestive gland. In the third chamber of the stomach, thick ridges extend towards the middle of the chamber. The fourth chamber is externally similar to the third chamber but is characterized by much lower and thinner internal ridges. The intestine is long and narrow, with intestinal loops of 
type
II. The transitional loop is oriented between 7 and 9 o’clock in unit #1 (
Fig. 16
), and between 6 and 9 o’clock in unit #2 (
Figs 2B, H
, 
16–17
). A rectal gland is present.

Nervous system
(
Fig. 12D
)
</p>
      <p>The circum-esophageal nerve ring is post-pharyngeal and pre-esophageal. The cerebral commissure between the paired cerebral ganglia is short but its length varies among individuals. The paired pleural and pedal ganglia are also all distinct. The visceral commissure is short but distinctly present and the visceral ganglion is approximately median. Cerebro-pleural and pleuro-pedal connectives are very short, and pleural and cerebral ganglia touch each other. Nerves from the cerebral ganglia innervate the buccal area and the ocular tentacles, and, on the right side, the penial complex. Nerves from the pedal ganglia innervate the foot. Nerves from the pleural ganglia innervate the lateral and dorsal regions of the mantle. Nerves from the visceral ganglion innervate the visceral organs.</p>
      <p>
Reproductive system
(
Figs 18–19
)
</p>
      <p>
Sexual maturity is correlated with animal length. Mature individuals have large, posterior, female (hermaphroditic) organs and fully-developed, anterior, male copulatory parts. Immature individuals (&lt;
22 mm
long) may have small or simply no posterior female organs, and rudimentary male parts. Hermaphroditic organs are located at the posterior end of the visceral cavity and consist of the female parts mixed with some male parts (
Fig. 18
). The hermaphroditic gland is a single mass. A hermaphroditic duct conveys the eggs and the autosperm from the hermaphroditic gland to the fertilization chamber, which connects to a large receptaculum seminis (caecum). The receptaculum seminis is generally elongated but its shape varies and it may be oval-shaped or almost spherical. The female gland mass contains various glands (mucus and albumen) of which the exact connections remain uncertain. The spermoviduct (for autosperm, exosperm and eggs) is embedded within the female gland mass, at least proximally. Distally, the spermoviduct branches into the deferent duct (which conveys the autosperm to the anterior region, running through the body wall) and the oviduct. The latter conveys the eggs up to the female opening and the exosperm from the female opening to the fertilization chamber. The section of the oviduct distal to the spermatheca is long, up to three or four times the length of the proximal section (from the female gland mass to the spermatheca). The oviduct is much wider (at least two or three times wider) than the deferent duct. The latter is closely attached to the surface of the oviduct, and is highly coiled, with U-shaped turns back and forth. The spherical spermatheca connects to the distal portion of the oviduct through a short duct.
</p>
      <p>
The male anterior organs include the penial complex (penis, vestibule, deferent duct, retractor muscle) (
Fig. 19
). There is no accessory penial gland. The penial sheath protects the penis for its entire length. The vestibule is continuous with the distal part of the penial sheath. The vestibule is cylindrical. Short muscle fibers connect the distal part of the penial sheath, near the vestibule, to the anterior wall of the visceral cavity. Inside the penial sheath, the penis is a narrow, thin, elongated, hollow tube. Its proximal region is rigid. Its distal region is flexible and bears hooks measuring from 80 to 130 μm (
Fig. 20
). The flexible region of the penis with hooks is generally between 4 and 
8 mm
long and approximately 
160 to 190 µm
wide. The hooks are inside the tube-like penis when it is inside the penial sheath (but can be seen by transparency) and are outside when the penis is evaginated like the finger of a glove. The penial sheath measures from approximately ¾ the length of the visceral cavity to nearly the entire length of the visceral cavity. The beginning of the retractor muscle marks the separation between the penial sheath and the deferent duct. The retractor muscle inserts at the posterior end of the body cavity near the rectum (in mature specimens). The length of the retractor muscle is variable. In unit #1, the retractor muscle is either shorter than the penial sheath (as short as ½ of its length) to almost equal to it. In unit #2, the retractor muscle is shorter than the penial sheath (between ⅓ and ½ of its length). The deferent duct is highly convoluted, with many loops, though it is less convoluted in immature specimens.

<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex coriaceus coriaceus

can generally be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
by the presence of distinctly-raised dorsal papillae in the two latter species (which are absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
). Large individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
(&gt;

<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus

P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
(&lt;

) by their size. Small individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
could potentially be confused with individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. burnupi
</tp:taxon-name>
(which, unlike 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, lack distinctly-raised dorsal papillae). However, note that based on current data, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. burnupi
</tp:taxon-name>
is only found in the western Indian Ocean and does not overlap geographically with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
. In addition, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
is distinct from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. burnupi
</tp:taxon-name>
based on several details of the reproductive and digestive systems (
Table 4
). For instance, the deferent duct is closely attached to the oviduct in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
while it is not (or only loosely) attached to it in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. burnupi
</tp:taxon-name>
. Internally, also, the intestinal loops are of 
type
II in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
and of 
type
I in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus

.
</p>
      <p>
The only species with which 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
overlaps geographically and cannot be distinguished externally is 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
, due to a similar foot color (variants of grey and yellow) and hyponotum color (variants of blue and grey). Internally, however, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
can easily be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
: the retractor muscle of the penis inserts at the posterior end of the visceral cavity in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
and near the heart in 
<tp:taxon-name>

and &lt;
1.5 mm

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
The publication dates of the various sections of the volume on 
Landmollusken
by Carl Semper in the 

Reisen im Archipel der 
Philippinen

series were clarified by 
Johnson (1969)
. The species name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
was first published with three figures illustrating the external morphology, dorsal eyes and penial hooks (
Semper 1880
: pl. 19, figs 1, 16, pl. 23, fig. 12) and no written description. Because 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
was published before 1931, ICZN Article 12.2.7 applies and Semper’s figures are regarded as an indication accompanying the new name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
. The text of the description and the illustration of the radula (pl. 21, fig. 7) were published in 1882. However, not everything in the written description refers to the subspecies described here (see below for more details). The illustrations of the dorsal surface (pl. 19, fig. 1), the dorsal eyes (pl. 19, fig. 16) and the radular teeth (pl. 21, fig. 7) could apply to any almost any species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
, so there is no reason to consider that they do not refer to the subspecies described here. The illustration of the male apparatus (pl. 23, fig. 12) could refer to the subspecies described here (if Semper illustrated one of the 
paralectotypes
from 
Singapore
or the 
Philippines
) or 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus darwinensis
</tp:taxon-name>
subsp. nov. (if Semper illustrated the 
paralectotype
from Brisbane, both subspecies being anatomically cryptic), even though his written description of the insertion of the retractor muscle (near the heart) matches that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
instead of the subspecies described here (insertion near the posterior end of the visceral cavity).
</p>
      <p>
Semper (1880)
originally described 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
based on 
syntypes
from Brisbane (
Australia
), 
Penang
(
Malaysia
), 
Singapore
, and 
Manila
(Luzon), 
Bohol
and 
Zamboanga
(Mindanao)in the 
Philippines
. Our sampling across the Indo-West Pacific shows that multiple species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
are present across the region encompassing these countries. A re-examination of the type material and a critical analysis of the original description reveal that, when describing 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coriaceum
, Semper
</tp:taxon-name>
used specimens that were part of at least two distinct species.
</p>
      <p>
The 
lectotype
from the 
Philippines
(ZMB/Moll 39028a) designated here clarifies the application of the name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
because it was dissected for the present study and it displays all the diagnostic features of the nominotypical subspecies described here. Two 
paralectotypes
(27/26 and 20/ 
16 mm
) from the 
Philippines
(ZMB/Moll 39028b) are also part of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
. The other 
paralectotypes
from the 
Philippines
, however, cannot be identified to the species level because the male reproductive parts were previously removed by Semper. Even though they seem to be part of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
, they potentially could belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
, both of which are found in the 
Philippines
.
</p>
      <p>
Semper mentioned that the 
paralectotype
(27/ 
25 mm
) from 
Penang
(ZMB/Moll 39029) had previously been misidentified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium typhae
</tp:taxon-name>
(there is only one dorsal eye on each of its papillae while there are 3 or 4 eyes per papilla in 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. typhae
</tp:taxon-name>
). This 
paralectotype
from 
Penang
was dissected (likely by Semper) and its penial complex is missing; however, the deferent duct in its posterior reproductive system is not attached to the oviduct, indicating that this 
paralectotype
is not part of the subspecies described here but is, instead, a misidentification of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
(an undescribed species at that time). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
also differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
with respect to the insertion of the retractor muscle: in the posterior half of the visceral cavity (from ½ to ¾ its length) in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
and near the end of the visceral cavity in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Also, in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
, the length of the flexible portion of the penis with hooks does not exceed 
2.5 mm
, while it measures from 
4 to 8 mm
in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Finally, the position of 20 dorsal eyes on the edge of the mantle described by Semper is a character compatible with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
, but not with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
or any related species within clade A (
Figs 1
, 
5
). 
Labbé (1934)
considered that the 
paralectotype
from 
Penang
was part of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
rather than 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
(likely based on Semper’s description because Labbé, who did not comment on the anatomy of that specimen, does not seem to have examined it).
</p>
      <p>
The large (22/ 
10 mm
) 
paralectotype
from 
Singapore
(ZMB/Moll 39030) was previously dissected and its copulatory apparatus is missing. However, it seems to be part of the subspecies described here because even though its posterior reproductive system is largely destroyed, the highly-coiled deferent duct is attached to the distal part of the oviduct, which is characteristic of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
. The notum of the small (20/ 
17 mm
) 
paralectotype
from 
Singapore
(ZMB/Moll 39030) was cut open for the present study. It is partly immature (its posterior reproductive system is not developed) but is definitely part of the subspecies described here because its penis is almost as long as the visceral cavity.
</p>
      <p>
Semper (1882: 272) also mentioned some material (likely only one specimen) collected in Brisbane (
Queensland
, 
Australia
) which could not be located by us. 
Queensland
is not part of the geographic distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
, so Semper’s material from Brisbane most likely did not belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Instead, it could belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus darwinensis
</tp:taxon-name>
subsp. nov. or 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Finally, Semper (1882: 272) mentioned two specimens at the Vienna Museum but from an unknown locality. It is not possible to determine which species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
Semper
</tp:taxon-name>
observed, which, thanks to the designation of the 
lectotype
from the 
Philippines
, is not an issue.
</p>
      <p>
Semper (1882: 273) noted that the only character which differed between the descriptions of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
was Stoliczka’s description of a “supplementary albuminous gland” (i.e., accessory penial gland) (
Stoliczka 1869: 107
), and indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
could be a synonym of Stoliczka’s 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
. Semper was not able to properly compare the anatomy of the two species without examining Stoliczka’s specimens and stated and that he could not be sure about the synonymy. An accessory penial gland is actually absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
, which is anatomically and genetically distinct from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
      <p>
Finally, Semper’s description of the penial morphology in the original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
needs to be commented on. The length of the flexible distal region of the penis with hooks was described by Semper as being 
6 mm
long, which is within the range observed here in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
4 to 8 mm
) but is incompatible with those of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
1 to 1.5 mm
) or 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
(
2 to 2.5 mm
). However, Semper also described a retractor muscle inserting “at the height of the heart” (1882: 272, translated from German), which is compatible with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
(the retractor muscle inserts near the heart), somewhat compatible with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
(insertion in the posterior half of the visceral cavity), but not with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
(insertion at the posterior end of the visceral cavity). There are only two possible explanations. First, Semper’s written description of the insertion of the retractor muscle is based on the 
paralectotype
from 
Penang
(which belongs to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
), or, second, Semper made a mistake.
</p>
      <p>
The description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidella condoriana
</tp:taxon-name>
by Rochebrune did not include any information about the internal anatomy. Externally, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. condoriana
</tp:taxon-name>
was described as “granulous and sprinkled with whitish tubercles and grey underneath” (
Rochebrune 1882: 67
, translated from Latin). The 
holotype
(23/ 
16 mm
) can readily be identified as a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
by the hard, flattened notum, but it was previously dissected by someone who removed the penial complex (it is unclear who dissected it because the species was not mentioned by Plate and neither Hoffmann nor Labbé commented on the internal anatomy). Most of the posterior (female) reproductive system is missing but the oviduct, which remains, is similar to that of the subspecies described here (with the highly-coiled deferent duct attached to it). Thus, the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. condoriana
</tp:taxon-name>
belongs to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
and not 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
(in which the deferent duct is almost straight). Note that 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
is likely also present in 
Vietnam
because it is known from western 
India
all the way to 
China
, even though we did not find it there. Because the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. condoriana
</tp:taxon-name>
(Côn Son Island, Côn Ðảo Archipelago, 
Vietnam
) is within the range of mitochondrial unit #1 (from Peninsular 
Malaysia
to 
China
and Sulawesi), the name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex condorianus
</tp:taxon-name>
could potentially apply to it, if it would ever need to be formally named. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
slugs were not found at the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. condoriana
</tp:taxon-name>
(we explored the Côn Ðảo Archipelago in 2015), but were found in mainland 
Vietnam
, in the Can Gio mangrove forest protected area. All those 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
slugs from the Can Gio mangrove forest belonged to 

<tp:taxon-name>P. coriaceus coriaceus</tp:taxon-name>
.

Finally, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
is likely also present in 
Vietnam
(
Fig. 10
), but the lack of dorsal eyes at the margin of the notum and the deferent duct being attached to the oviduct indicate that Rochebrune’s type of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. condoriana
</tp:taxon-name>
is not part of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
      <p>
Plate (1893: 190–191)
re-described 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
based on Semper’s original specimens from the 
Philippines
. Semper did not indicate how many individuals he examined from the 
Philippines
, but Plate listed ten specimens. Only seven of Semper’s 
type
specimens were located from the 
Philippines
(ZMB/Moll 39028), suggesting that some specimens may have been previously destroyed. Plate’s description of one single dorsal eye per papilla with papillae irregularly distributed is consistent with a species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
. He also mentioned new details that were not included in Semper’s original description, such as the granular notum, the male pore being above and to the left of the right oral lobe (i.e., below and to the left of the right oral tentacle) and intestinal loops of 
type
II. The number of radular teeth per half row (120) described by Plate is within the range reported here (from 70 to 120), and it is expected that the number he observed would be at the high end of the range due to the large size of the specimens that he examined (up to 
47 mm
long).
</p>
      <p>
Plate described 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis semperi
</tp:taxon-name>
based on two 
syntypes
(22/18 and 22/ 
18 mm
) from Mindanao (ZMB/Moll 45661). The width of the foot and the position of the male opening confirm that they belong to a species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
. According to 
Plate (1893: 193)
, the penis of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis semperi
</tp:taxon-name>
is extremely long (
26 mm
in a slug that was only 
24.5 mm
long), inserts at the posterior end of the body cavity, and its distal, flexible region with hooks is 
8 mm
long. This description is only consistent with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Table 4
). However, Plate’s description of intestinal loops of type I is problematic because it is inconsistent with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Two explanations are possible. Most likely, Plate’s description of a type I was a mistake (his description of the intestinal loops in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amboinae
</tp:taxon-name>
was a mistake). Alternatively, one of the 
syntypes
could belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
(in which the intestine can be of type I). Because Plate’s description of the copulatory apparatus matches perfectly that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. semperi
</tp:taxon-name>
is regarded as a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
and it is assumed that Plate confused the types of intestinal loops.
</p>
      <p>
Semper (1882: 272) questioned whether 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
could be a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium marmoratum
Lesson, 1831
</tp:taxon-name>
, and noted that the original description was insufficient to separate it from 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Bretnall (1919: 323)
also listed this potential synonymy with a question mark. The original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. marmoratum
</tp:taxon-name>
did not indicate any characters which would distinguish it from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
, but the type specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. marmoratum
</tp:taxon-name>
do not share the flattened shape of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
slugs and clearly do not belong to this genus. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium marmoratum
</tp:taxon-name>
was recently transferred to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Marmaronchis
Dayrat &amp; Goulding, 2018
</tp:taxon-name>
(

Dayrat 
et al
. 2018

). 
Hoffmann (1928: 88)
suggested that 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. condoriana
</tp:taxon-name>
were all synonyms of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis stuxbergi
(
Westerlund, 1883
)
</tp:taxon-name>
but he did not describe the anatomy of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis stuxbergi
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Westerlund (1883: 165)
also did not describe the internal anatomy of this species (described as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Vaginulus stuxbergi
</tp:taxon-name>
). Thus, neither Westerlund’s description nor Hoffmann’s remarks can be attributed to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
. The specific name 
<tp:taxon-name>
stuxbergi
</tp:taxon-name>
applies to a species in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium
</tp:taxon-name>
as a result of the designation of a 
lectotype
(

Dayrat 
et al
. 2016: 22

). Note that 
Hoffmann (1928)
thought that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
was a junior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis stuxbergi
</tp:taxon-name>
because he adopted 1885 as the date of publication for Semper’s monograph in the 

Reisen im Archipel der 
Philippinen

series (for a collation of Semper’s monograph, see 
Johnson 1969
). 
Labbé (1934: 235–236)
, who does not seem to have examined any specimens, followed Hoffmann in considering 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis coriacea
</tp:taxon-name>
a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis stuxbergi
</tp:taxon-name>
. For unclear reasons, he indicated an insertion of the penial retractor near the heart, which is not consistent with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
      <p>
DNA sequences of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
from southern 
China
were misidentified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
by 

Sun 
et al
. (2014)

. Recent COI DNA sequences by Wang 
et al
. (unpublished, GenBank Accession 
GU166575
and 
GU166577
) were also identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
, and are shown here to belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Therefore, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
is not restricted to southernmost 
China
but is also present in the 
Fujian Province
of 
China
(the province facing 
Taiwan)
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
should also be present around 
Hong Kong
, which is south of Fujian province. 
Hong Kong
is the 
type
locality for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
, a name which is regarded here as a nomen dubium (see our remarks on 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
). Additionally, DNA sequences published by 

Takagi 
et al
. (2019)

show that 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
is present in southern 
Japan
, and is closely related to individuals from northern 
China
, i.e., north of 
Taiwan
(
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
unit #3). Finally, a voucher specimen identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
cf. 
coriaceus
(

Dayrat 
et al
. 2011

)
</tp:taxon-name>
in the collection of the Natural History Museum in London (NHMUK 20060274) actually belongs to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex burnupi
</tp:taxon-name>
. Von 
Martens (1897: 127)
indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis coriacea
</tp:taxon-name>
was identified from “ 
Celebes
: bei Luwu” [Luwu, 
Sulawesi
, 
Indonesia
] by M. Weber, from “Halmaheira: Dodinga” by himself, as well as from 
Java
and “ 
Nikobaren
, Pulo Pinang und 
Philippinen
” [
Nicobar Islands
; 
Penang
, 
Malaysia
; the 
Philippines
] based on specimens in the Berlin Museum. Von Martens did not provide any details about how the specimens were identified. The specimens from Halmahera, Java, 
Malaysia
, the 
Philippines
and 
Sulawesi
, 
Indonesia
could be either 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex coriaceus

was not found in the Andaman Islands, but could be present in the
