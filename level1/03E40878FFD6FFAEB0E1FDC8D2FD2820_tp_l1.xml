Etymology
</p>
      <p>
This species is dedicated to the memory of Mélissa Lagrède, a French caver and friend of Josiane Lips. Mélissa died in an accident inside a nearby cave on the very day the 
holotype
of this new species was collected. She also collected a 
paratype
in the same cave the day before she died. Noun in apposition.

Description

      <p>
BODY. Length is 
9 mm
in 
holotype
, 
10.4 mm
in female 
paratype
and 
6 mm
in male 
paratype
. Epicuticle smooth under optical microscope but reticulated at higher magnification, showing irregular polygonal structures of variable sizes (
Figs 31–33
). Body with apparently smooth clothing setae that in SEM have tiny expansions (micro–barbs) more abundant on other setae (macrosetae, marginal setae, style setae, tarsal setae and calcars) (
Figs 26–29
, 
36
, 
42–45
).

HEAD. In 
holotype
, one complete and intact antennae with 49 antennomeres; antennae slightly longer than body length (
Table 3
), with medial antennomeres 3 × as long as wide. Apical antennomere 4 × as long as wide, with irregular cupuliform organ containing ramiform, net-like complex with numerous perforations, occupying 1/10 of distal portion (
Figs 20–21, 23
). Distal and central antennomeres with two whorls of micro-barbed macrosetae (
Figs 26–29
); in addition, these have single distal whorl of up to 8–10 thin long gouge sensilla of 
85–95 µm
in length (
Figs 22, 24
), among them one small coniform sensillum (
10 µm
long). Proximal antennomeres with trichobothria on antennomeres 
3–5 in
a 2, 3, 1 pattern but with long flagellum (
500–800 µm
long in 
holotype
). Third antennomere with bacilliform sensillum (
25 µm
long) in ventral position (
Fig. 25
). Coniform protrusion of frontal process with one anterior and four posterior micro–barbed macrosetae. Three macrosetae along each side of insertion line of antennomere and 
x
setae with micro-barbs; ratios of length in female 
paratype
a
/ 
i
/ 
p
/ 
x
are 49/51/51/42, respectively. Suboval labial palps large, each with bacilliform latero-external sensillum near two simple
</p>
      <p>setae, in posterior position with two guard setae and up to 24 setae on anterior portion, which are followed by up to 130 neuroglandular setae on posterior portion.</p>

smp
(1+1

) macrosetae. All macrosetae slightly thin and micro-barbed, with a few longer and thin distal barbs; marginal setae longer than clothing setae. Legs elongated and metathoracic legs overpass end of abdomen. Tibia longer than femur or tarsus (
Table 3
). Femora III with one short dorsal macrosetae (
0.17 mm
in 
1.88 mm
femur of paratype-4158) (femora I–II with one dorsal macrosetae, less frequently without or with one submacrosetae instead). Calcar covered with thin abundant micro-barbs all over. Tibia I–III with one short completely micro-barbed ventral macroseta (in 
holotype
, prothoracic legs of tibia with three and two macrosetae). Each tibia with two ventral rows of thick micro-barbed setae, scattered around tibia thin micro-barbed setiform sensilla. Three dorsal and one ventral tarsal subapical setae with micro-barbs (
Figs 34, 36
). Subequal elbowed claws with lateral crest; basal and ventral portions of claws covered with very small, thin, spiniform formations. Laminar lateral processes of the pretarsus completely covered with what was initially thought to be dense pubescence, but under SEM high magnifications turned out to be thick micro-barbs (
Figs 34, 36–39
).

post
1–5 (5+5 (

) on VIII tergite; and 6+6 
post
on IX abdominal segment. Short micro-barbed abdominal macrosetae with few distal barbs on urotergites V– VII; urotergite VIII and abdominal segment with similar but longer macrosetae. Urosternite I with 12+12 macrosetae (
Fig. 41
); urosternites II to VII with 5+5 macrosetae; urosternite VIII with 1+1 macrosetae; urosternal macrosetae complete covered by micro-barbs including a few distal short barbs. Stylus with apical, subapical and ventromedial setae completely covered with both micro-barbs and one apical barb (
Figs 42–43
). Cerci 1.7 × as long as body length in two presumably regenerated cerci of 
paratype
, with six primary articles (
Table 4
). Length of cerci quickly increases from proximal to distal articles, covered with long setae, and macrosetae covered with micro-barbs; each primary article with single apical whorl of shorter and thinner setae also covered with micro-barbs (
Figs 44–45
).

SECONDARY SEX CHARACTERS. Female urosternite I with coniform appendages, each bearing up to 12 glandular 
a
