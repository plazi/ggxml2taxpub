      <p>
Body splayed and gracile, males: SVL 88.8–123.0 mm (mean ±SE: 109.3 ± 
1.4 mm
, n =34), TaL 
2.8–96.8 mm
(72.5 ± 
3.8 mm
); adult females: SVL 
86.5–126.5 mm
(112.4 ± 
1.3 mm
, n=43), TaL 
43.3–102.2 mm
(72.2± 
2.1 mm
); juveniles: SVL 55.0– 
84.8 mm
(74.8 ± 
3.1 mm
, n=11), TaL 44.2– 68.9 (58.7 ± 
2.7 mm
) (Supp. file 1: Table S2); head triangular, wider than neck, covered by uniform granular scales interspersed with tubercles in temporal and occipital regions; scales on rostrum slightly larger and flatter; enlarged supraorbital tubercles in a conspicuous row; middorsal portion of rostral partially sutured dorsomedially, bordered laterally by first supralabial on each side, dorsolaterally by prenasal on each side, and dorsally by 1 or 2 internasal and two supranasals; internasals 1 or 2; external nares bordered by 5–8 nasal scales (prenasal, anterior and posterior supranasals, 2 slightly enlarged postnasal, and 1–3 granular scales); preorbital scales 13–16; supralabials 8–12, grading into granular scales posteriorly; infralabials 8–11; eyes large, pupils vertical; eyelid fringe scales 46–56, those of upper eyelid slightly enlarged; outer surface of upper eyelid composed of granular scales, about one half the size of those on top of head and without enlarged tubercles; fold of skin originating in suborbital region extends posteroventrally across angle of jaw; external auditory meatus elliptical with long axis directed dorsoventrally; tympanum deeply recessed; mental triangular, bordered laterally by first infralabial on each side and posteriorly by 2–6 postmentals; postmentals bordered by 6–11 gular scales; gular region below lower jaws with enlarged tubercles; gular scales juxtaposed and granular, abruptly grading posteriorly into flat hexagonal pectoral scales and even larger ventral scales.
</p>
      <p>Neck narrower than body, covered with uniform granular scales interspersed with several sharply pointed conical tubercles on nape; tubercles on flanks conical, those of vertebral region somewhat more flat; dorsal body tubercles surrounded by 11–13 granular scales; dorsal tubercle rows at midbody 20–24; paravertebral tubercles between limb insertions 29–38, distinct vertebral row of tubercles absent; scale rows around midbody 119–144; ventral scales large; males with 24–32 precloacal pores in a transverse continuous series, females without precloacal pores (but pitted scales present); region posterior to vent covered by flat juxtaposed scales and greatly swollen, containing 1–3 enlarged tubercles on each side at level of vent; tail thick at base, light band on tail base in width of 9–13 granular scales with 9–10 tubercles in transversal series; ventral caudals of tail base larger than dorsal caudals.</p>
      <p>Limbs relatively long and thin, covered dorsally with granular scales interspersed with several tubercles and ventrally with flat juxtaposed to subimbricate scales; dorsal granular scales grade into slightly flattened subimbricate scales on top of pes and manus; hind limbs larger than forelimbs; axillary pockets deep; subdigital lamellae wide, 9–12 under first finger, 17–22 under fourth finger, 10–12 under first toe,</p>
