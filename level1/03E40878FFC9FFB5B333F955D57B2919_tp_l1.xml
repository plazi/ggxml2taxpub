It has a smooth cuticle, under optical microscope, covered by abundant short smooth clothing setae. The antennae are apparently intact with 26 antennomeres; the medial antennomeres are 3 × as long as wide, and the last antennomere has about eight spheroidal olfactory chemoreceptors; the third antennomere has a sensillum in ventral position (
c–d
macrosetae). The plain frontal process has one long anterior smooth macrosetae and two, almost two times shorter, posterior macrosetae; the three macrosetae have a few thin distal barbs along each side of the insertion line of antennomere longer than the smooth

macrosetae; all notal macrosetae are robust with a few short distal barbs; the marginal setae are thicker than the clothing setae with short distal barbs, whereas the lateral posterior marginal setae are larger with abundant small barbs. The metathoracic legs overpass the end of the abdomen; the femora have one dorsal robust macroseta with 2–3 distal barbs, the tibia has two short ventral macrosetae with 1–2 apical barbs and the calcars have 3–4 long barbs; the tarsus has two rows of smooth robust ventral setae, three long smooth dorsal and one distal ventral setae; the pretarsus is without lateral processes, with subequal elbowed claws and with a smooth ventral surface, ridged on the dorsal side, that looks like very small lateral crests under optical microscope, but they are not.

Urosternite I with 6+6, urosternites II–VII with 5+5, and urosternite VIII with 1+1 macrosetae; all urosternal macrosetae are robust with a few long barbs; robust smooth stylar setae. First urosternite appendages (female) are subcylindrical and long with an apical field of
