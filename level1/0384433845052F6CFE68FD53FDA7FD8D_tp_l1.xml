</p>
      <p>HEAD. Face about 0.65–0.75 × as high as wide. Malar space 0.6–0.7 × width of mandibular base. Gena 0.7 × as long as eye (maximum width, seen laterally); temple about 0.7 × as long as eye (seen dorsally), weakly narrowed behind eye, imaginary lines connecting outer side of eye and temple intersect at the level of the scutellum. OOD 0.65 × distance between lateral ocelli. Mandibular teeth subequal. Clypeus 0.5 × as high as wide, not produced in profile medially, matt and coriaceous, its apical margin sharp and gently rounded. Face and frons granulate and matt. Vertex and temples coriaceous and subpolished. Flagellum in examined specimens with 32 segments, flagellomeres in apical quarter about 0.75–0.8 × as long as wide.</p>
      <p>MESOSOMA. Pronotum medio-ventrally with longitudinal striae, dorsally coriaceous. Epomia indistinct. Mesoscutum and scutellum granulate and matt, scutellum without lateral carinae. Mesopleuron coriaceous and matt, with shallow and scattered punctures, especially on antero-ventral half; speculum smooth, anteriorly with fine longitudinal striae. Epicnemial carina only slightly sinuate subventrally, from subventrally to ventrally clearly and evenly raised, in middle with a shallow notch but not produced into lobes. Metapleuron coriaceous and matt. Fore wing with areolet small and petiolate, 2m-cu beyond its middle; 1cu-a opposite M&amp;RS. Hind wing with proximal abscissa of CU 4.5–5 × as long as cu-a, distal abscissa of CU unpigmented. Hind femur 4.5 × as long as its maximum width, the longer inner tibial spur about 0.5–0.6 × as long as hind basitarsus. Propodeum with area basalis rectangular, about 0.4 × as wide as area superomedia; area superomedia large, about 1.7 × as wide as long, granulate and matt, with few small striae on lateral margins, slightly depressed and open posteriorly. Area petiolaris slightly depressed and with irregular transverse striae. Rim of propodeal spiracle and carina connecting propodeal spiracle to pleural carina normal.</p>
      <p>METASOMA. Postpetiole coriaceous. Metasomal tergite II 1.4 × as long as apically wide. Ovipositor ratio 1.4–1.5.</p>
      <p>COLOUR. Black. Palps and tegulae yellowish-white. Mandibles (except black base and reddish teeth) and pedicel apically yellow. Scape and flagellum yellowish-brown, flagellum lighter distally. Pterostigma yellowish-brown. All coxae black, fore coxa yellow marked distally, all tibial spurs yellowish-white; fore and mid trochanters and trochantelli yellowish-red, fore and mid femora, tibiae and tarsi yellowishred. Hind trochanter and trochantellus brownish, hind femur red, hind tibia and tarsus yellowish-red, tibia with very small light spot at the base, very slightly brownish subbasally and apically.
