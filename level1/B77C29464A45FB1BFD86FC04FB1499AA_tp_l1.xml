Differential diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Pseudostrandesia ratchaburiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. complexa
(
Victor &amp; Fernando, 1981
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. phetchabunensis
Savatenalinton &amp; Martens, 2010
</tp:taxon-name>
. It differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. complexa
</tp:taxon-name>
by the more elongated Cp in the lateral view, the large β–seta on the Md-palp, the long g and h3 setae on the T2 and the morphology of the CR. It is obviously distinguishable from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. phetchabunensis
</tp:taxon-name>
by the presence of the antero-ventral flange of the LV.
