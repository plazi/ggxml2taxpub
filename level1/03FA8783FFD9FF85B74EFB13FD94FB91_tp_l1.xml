Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
This species is close to the 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. simlaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
owing to a similar structure, sculpture of the body and the fact that the females morphologically are difficult to distinguish, but 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. iridipennis
</tp:taxon-name>
has a slightly less transverse head (1.1 times as wide as long vs 1.2) and entirely red legs (at least femora black or brownish in 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. simlaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
).

Female

      <p>
Total body length 
4.5 mm
(
Fig. 11A
). Head weakly transverse, at most 1.1 times as wide as long (
Fig. 11B
); vertex not elevated as seen in frontal view; F1 and F2 transverse, 0.5–0.6 times as long as wide, F3 0.8 times as long as wide; clypeus with punctures separated by 1–3 puncture diameters; ocello-ocular area with fine punctures separated by 1–3 puncture diameters; face and gena with sparse pubescence. Mesoscutum and mesoscutellum with punctures (15–20 μm) separated by 1–4 puncture diameters (
Fig. 11D
); hypoepimeral area coarsely reticulate; metafemur weakly enlarged in proximal half, maximum width 0.35 times its length; legs red. Propodeal triangle (metapostnotum) with coarse longitudinal wrinkles and shiny interspaces. Metasomal terga scarcely punctate, T1 impunctate, remaining terga basally with sparse fine setal pores (
Fig. 11E
); marginal zones impunctate; terga red to red-brownish apically, pygidial plate 0.7 times as wide as metabasitarsus.

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
Since we could not clearly differentiate between females of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. iridipennis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. simlaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, except by their relative head length and coloration, more specimens should be studied (including the male finding) to make a decision on their synonymy.
</p>
      <p>
The specimens recorded as 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. iridipennis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Chapra (
India
) by 
Rajkumar &amp; Dey (2016: 1847
, pl. 3) belong to another species. Unlike the 
holotype
this specimen, re-described as 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. iridipennis
</tp:taxon-name>
, has more transverse head (1.3 times as wide as long) and possibly belongs to the undescribed female of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. chaprensis
Blüthgen, 1927
</tp:taxon-name>
.
