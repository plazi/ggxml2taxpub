Dire wolves are considered to be one of the most common and widespread large carnivores in Pleistocene America 
1
, yet relatively little is known about their evolution or extinction.Here,to reconstruct the evolutionary history of dire wolves,we sequenced five genomes from sub-fossil remains dating from 13,000 to more
</p>
         <p>
than 50,000 years ago. Our results indicate that although they were similar morphologically to the extant grey wolf,dire wolves were a highly divergent lineage that split from living canids around 5.7 million years ago.In contrast to numerous examples of hybridization across 
<tp:taxon-name>Canidae</tp:taxon-name>2
, 
3
, there is no evidence for gene flow between dire wolves and either North American grey wolves or coyotes.This suggests that dire wolves evolved in isolation from the Pleistocene ancestors of these species. Our results also support an early New World origin of dire wolves,while the ancestors of grey wolves,coyotes and dholes evolved in Eurasia and colonized North America only relatively recently.
</p>
         <p>
Dire wolves (
<tp:taxon-name>Canis dirus
</tp:taxon-name>
) were large (around 
68 kg
)wolf-like canids and among the most common extinct large carnivores of the American Late Pleistocene megafauna 
1
. Dire wolf remains are present in the North American palaeontological record from at least around 250,000 to about13,000years ago,at the end of the Pleistocene epoch,particularly in the lower latitudes 
4
(

). Other canid species that were present in Late Pleistocene North America include the slightly smaller grey wolf (
<tp:taxon-name>Canis lupus
</tp:taxon-name>
), the much smaller coyote (
<tp:taxon-name>Canis latrans
</tp:taxon-name>
) and the dhole (or Asiatic wild dog; 
<tp:taxon-name>Cuon alpinus
</tp:taxon-name>
), although dire wolves appear to have been more common overall 
1
. For example,more than 4,000 individuals have been excavated from California’s fossil-rich Rancho La Brea tar seeps alone,where they outnumber grey wolves more than100-fold 
5
, 
6
. Despite the abundance of dire wolf fossils,their origins,taxonomic relationships and ultimate driver of their extinction remain unclear. Dire wolves are generally described as a sister species to 
7
– 
10
, or even conspecific with, the grey wolf 
11
. The leading hypothesis to explain their extinction is that, owing to their larger body size compared with grey wolves and coyotes,dire wolves were more specialized for hunting large prey and were unable to survive the extinction of their megafaunal prey 
12
– 
14
. To test this hypothesis, we performed geomet- ric morphometric analyses of more than 
700 specimens
.Our results indicate that although specimens of dire wolves and grey wolves can be differentiated,their morphology is highly similar (

, Supple- mentary Information, Supplementary 

–6 and Supplementary Data 3–12).Although this morphometric similarity may be driven in part by allometry (

, Supplementary Information),the lack of dis- tinctiveness between grey wolves and dire wolves has been interpreted to be a result of a close evolutionary relationship 
9
, 
11
. Alternatively, a competing hypothesis maintains that these morphological similari- ties are the result of convergence,and that dire wolves instead are a species that belongs to a separate taxonomic lineage (classified in the monotypic genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Aenocyon
</tp:taxon-name>
, ‘terrible’ or ‘dreadful’ wolf 
15
).
</p>
         <p>
To resolve the evolutionary history of dire wolves, we screened 46 sub-fossil specimens for the presence of preserved genomic DNA (Supplementary Data 1). We identified five samples from 
Idaho
(Dire- AFR &amp; DireGB), 
Ohio
(DireSP), 
Tennessee
(DireGWC) and 
Wyoming
(DireNTC),dating to between 12,900 and more than 50,000years ago, that possessed sufficient endogenous DNA to obtain both mitochon- drial genomes(between around 1× and 31× coverage) and low-coverage nuclear genome sequences (approximately 0.01× to 0.23× coverage) using hybridization capture or shotgun sequencing methods (Supple- mentary Information).All of these samples displayed molecular dam- age profiles that are typical of ancient DNA (Supplementary Figs.8,9). Although we did not successfully sequence DNA from dire wolf specimens from the La Brea tar seeps, one specimen did contain type-I collagen (
COL1
) that was suitable for sequencing using pal- aeoproteomic methods (Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Information). Analyses of the dire wolf 
COL1
sequence suggested that they were not closely related to grey wolves,coyotes,African wolves(
<tp:taxon-name>Canis lupaster
</tp:taxon-name>
) or dogs(
<tp:taxon-name>Canis familiaris
</tp:taxon-name>
) (Supplementary Fig.7).These data,however, could not confidently resolve the relationships between more distantly related canids owing to a lack of lineage-specific amino acid changes among these species 
16
. Phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial genomes indicated that dire wolves form a well-supported monophyl- etic group that is highly divergent from grey wolves and coyotes (Sup- plementary Fig. 10; see Supplementary Data 13 and Supplementary Tables 2–4 for a list of the 13 species and their coverage used in this analysis),contradicting recent palaeontological analyses 
7
– 
9
(

). Canid mitochondrial phylogenies, however, may not represent the true evolutionary relationships of the species as both admixture and incomplete lineage sorting have been shown to affect canid phyloge- netic topologies 
3
,17

. To resolve the phylogenetic relationships of dire wolves,we analysed the nuclear genomic data of the dire wolves together with previously published genomic data from eight extant canids:grey wolf, coyote, African wolf, dhole, Ethiopian wolf (
<tp:taxon-name>Canis simensis
</tp:taxon-name>
), African wild dog (
<tp:taxon-name>Lycaon pictus
</tp:taxon-name>
), Andean fox (
<tp:taxon-name>Lycalopex culpaeus
</tp:taxon-name>
) and grey fox (
<tp:taxon-name>Urocyon cinereoargenteus
</tp:taxon-name>
—an outgroup).Of these species,the geographical ranges of grey wolves,coyotes,dholes and grey foxes overlapped with that of dire wolves during the Pleistocene epoch (

). We also gener- ated new nuclear genome sequences for a grey wolf from 
Montana
and the two endemic African jackals—the black-backed and side-striped jackal (
<tp:taxon-name>Canis mesomelas
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Canis adustus
</tp:taxon-name>
, respectively)—to ensure representation of all extant members of the ‘wolf-like canid’ clade (com- prising 
<tp:taxon-name>Canis
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Lycaon
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cuon
</tp:taxon-name>
and their extinct relatives) (Supplementary Data 13).Supermatrix analyses,based on nuclear sequence alignments of 70 kb to 28 Mb (depending on overall coverage for each dire wolf genome;Supplementary Tables 5,7) confirmed a distant evolutionary relationship between dire wolves and the other wolf-like canids(

, Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Figs.15,16).This analysis, however, could not definitively resolve whether dire wolves were the basal members of the wolf-like canid clade or the second lineage to diverge after the common ancestor of the two African jackals. We investigated canid phylogenetic relationships in greater detail using a range of species tree analyses 
18
, 
19
and 
D
-statistics(Supplemen- tary Information).These approaches produced concordant trees that support the monophyly of three primary lineages:dire wolves,African jackals and a clade comprising all other extant wolf-like canids(

, Supplementary Tables 6–8 and Supplementary Figs.11–16).Although our species tree analyses provided equivocal results regarding the relationships among these lineages,grey wolves (genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Canis
</tp:taxon-name>
)are more closely related to African wild dogs (genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Lycaon
</tp:taxon-name>
) (Supplementary Fig. 19), dholes (genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Cuon
</tp:taxon-name>
) (Supplementary Fig. 21) and Ethiopian wolves (Supplementary Fig. 22) than to either dire wolves or African jackals (both genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Canis
</tp:taxon-name>
). This finding is consistent with previously proposed designations of the genera 
<tp:taxon-name>Lupulella
</tp:taxon-name>20
for the African jackals and 
<tp:taxon-name>Aenocyon
</tp:taxon-name>15
for dire wolves. To assess the timing of divergence among the major wolf-like canid lineages,we performed a Bayesian clock-dating analysis using MCMC- tree 
21
. Although the dire wolf sequences are low coverage and include post-mortem damage, extensive simulations indicated that this is unlikely to affect the time of divergence estimates inferred by MCMC- tree (Supplementary Information,Supplementary Tables 9–11 and Sup- plementary Fig.17).This analysis confirmed that the initial divergences of the three primary wolf-like canid lineages occurred rapidly,which contributes to the poor resolution of the tree as a result of incomplete lineage sorting (Fig. 2a). The dire wolf lineage last shared a common ancestor with extant wolf-like canids around 5.7 million years ago(95% highest posterior density (HPD), 4.0–8.5 million years ago) (Fig. 2a), followed by the divergence of African jackals around 5.1 million years ago (95% HPD,3.5–7.6 million years ago) (Fig.2b).

         <p>
Given the tendency for sympatric canid species to interbreed 
2
, 
3
, 
22
, we tested for genomic signals of admixture between extant North American canids and dire wolves using 
D
-statistics 
23
(Supplementary Information) on a dataset that included 22 modern North American grey wolves and coyotes,three ancient dogs 
24
– 
26
and a Pleistocene wolf 
27
(Supplementary Data 13). Specifically, we computed statistics of the form 
D
(outgroup (grey fox); dire wolf; North American canid (grey wolf or coyote); African wolf/Eurasian wolf) and found no significant excess of shared derived alleles between dire wolves and any extant North American canid (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 18 and Supple- mentary Data 14).This result indicates that the dire wolves sequenced in this study did not possess ancestry from grey wolves,coyotes or their recent North American ancestors.Although we cannot exclude the possibility that some unsampled canid population has some dire wolf hybrid ancestry,the lack of a hybridization signal in our broad set of genomes suggests that admixture is unlikely to have occurred. Although we did not find evidence of recent admixture,we did find that African wild dogs share fewer derived alleles with dire wolves than with grey wolves,coyotes,African wolves,dholes or Ethiopian wolves (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig.20 and Supplementary Data 15, 16). This indicates that an episode of ancient admixture between the ancestor of dire wolves and the ancestor of wolves,coyotes and dholes occurred at least around 3 million years ago (based on the lower bound of the 95% HPD on the age of their common ancestor) (Fig. 2a), which may have contributed to the challenge of resolving the branching order of the basal wolf-like canid lineages (Fig.2a).
</p>
         <p>
Hybridization is common among wolf-like canid lineages when their ranges overlap.For example,modern grey wolves and coyotes hybridize readily in North America 
2
. Genomic data also suggest that gene flow occurred between dholes and African wild dogs during the Pleistocene epoch 
3
, millions of years after their divergence. Consequently, our finding of no evidence for gene flow between dire wolves and grey wolves,coyotes or their common ancestor—despite substantial range overlap with dire wolves during the Late Pleistocene—suggests that the common ancestor of grey wolves and coyotes probably evolved in geographical isolation from members of the dire wolf lineage.This result is consistent with the hypothesis that dire wolves originated in the Americas 
1
, 
6
, 
28
, 
29
, and probably belonged to the same lineage as the extinct Armbruster’s wolf (
<tp:taxon-name>Canis armbrusteri
</tp:taxon-name>
) 
7
.
</p>
         <p>
Long-term isolation of the dire wolf lineage in the Americas implies that other American fossil taxa, such as the Pliocene 
<tp:taxon-name>Canis edwardii
</tp:taxon-name>
, a proposed relative of the coyote 
7
, may instead belong to the dire wolf lineage. Thus, the diversification of the extant wolf-like canids probably occurred in parallel outside of the Americas, and perhaps began earlier than hypothesized. The living 
<tp:taxon-name>Canis
</tp:taxon-name>
species may have descended from Old World members of the extinct genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Eucyon
</tp:taxon-name>
, which first appeared in the fossil record of Africa and Eurasia at the end of the Miocene epoch 
30
. Geographical isolation since the late Miocene is consistent with our molecular estimates for the age of the dire wolf lineage, and may have allowed dire wolves to evolve some degree of reproductive isolation before the arrival of grey wolves,
</p>
         <p>
coyotes, dholes and 
<tp:taxon-name>Xenocyon
</tp:taxon-name>
(another extinct wolf-like canid) in North America during the Late Pleistocene.
</p>
         <p>
Despite their overall phenotypic similarities,grey wolves and coy- otes survived the Late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions whereas dire wolves did not.One possible reason may be that both grey wolves and coyotes possessed greater morphological plasticity and dietary flexibility, thus allowing them to avoid extinction and become the dominant terrestrial predators in North America 
14
, 
31
. This scenario is supported by the date that we obtained from the DireGWC specimen (
12,820–12,720
calibrated years before present), which suggests that dire wolves survived until at least the Younger Dryas cold reversal, a period that also witnessed the latest known dates for other specialized North American mega-carnivores such as the American lion(
<tp:taxon-name>Panthera
atrox
</tp:taxon-name>
) and giant short-faced bear (
<tp:taxon-name>Arctodus simus
</tp:taxon-name>
) 
32
, 
33
. Alternatively, grey wolves and coyotes may have survived as a result of their ability to hybridize with other canids.Through adaptive introgression with dogs,North American grey wolves are known to have acquired traits related to coat colour,hypoxia and immune response 
34
, 
35
.Specifically, enhanced immunity may have allowed grey wolves to resist diseases carried by newly arriving Old World taxa.Because our results demon- strate that dire wolves did not derive any ancestry from other wolf-like canid species,it is plausible that reproductive isolation prevented dire wolves from acquiring traits that may have allowed them to survive into the Holocene epoch.
