         <p> Introduction </p>
         <p> Marking behavior or abdomen dragging (we shall use the terms interchangeably), in which
            males walk up or down plant stems apparently depositing a sex-attractant pheromone from
            glands prominent only in the male ( ), is well known in <tp:taxon-name> Philanthus
            </tp:taxon-name> ( , , , , , , ). However, males belonging to the genus <tp:taxon-name>
               Cerceris </tp:taxon-name> , which is also placed in the
               <tp:taxon-name>Philanthinae</tp:taxon-name> , have only been recorded abdomen
            dragging once in the literature, based on a brief observation involving a single
            individual of <tp:taxon-name> C. nigrescens </tp:taxon-name> ( ). Other species of
               <tp:taxon-name> Cerceris </tp:taxon-name> have been observed nonaggressively
            patrolling areas (particularly those with flowering plants or near nests with emerging
            females) in search of receptive females ( , , ). Two European species of <tp:taxon-name>
               Cerceris </tp:taxon-name> have very distinctive cephalic glands that differ from
            those exhibited by members of the genus <tp:taxon-name> Philanthus </tp:taxon-name>
            suggesting that male <tp:taxon-name> Cerceris </tp:taxon-name> do not generally engage
            in the marking behavior of other <tp:taxon-name>Philanthinae</tp:taxon-name> ( ). Here
            we report on observations of <tp:taxon-name> C. clypeata </tp:taxon-name> over a period
            of several days in which several males regularly appeared to mark grass stems in a
            hayfield in northern Virginia. Male behavior of this very small species of
               <tp:taxon-name> Cerceris </tp:taxon-name> has not been reported previously although
            female nesting behavior has been described by . </p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="materials_methods">
         <title>N/A</title>
         <p>Materials and methods</p>
         <p> When a single male of <tp:taxon-name> C. clypeata </tp:taxon-name> was seen apparently
            marking grass stems in a hayfield in the middle of the day on 16 July 2018, the site was
            inspected at midday on 21 following days. However, a male or males were only present for
            eight of these days (rainy or cloudy days were apparently unacceptable to the wasps
            although they were also absent on five sunny, warm days). The area in which males were
            found was located at the edge of a hayfield on the farm at 38°52'27.22"N , 77°54'17.12"W
            . The grasses there were introduced species, including Johnson grass ( <tp:taxon-name>
               Sorghum halepense </tp:taxon-name> ). </p>
         <p>Five males were given distinctive color marks on the thorax with blue, white and pink
            Uniposca pencil-pens in order to attempt to follow known individuals at the marking
            sites.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="results">
         <title>N/A</title>
         <p>Results</p>
         <p>From one to three males occurred at the hayfield location during the 8 days when at
            least one male was present. During this time, a total of 5 sites were occupied at one
            time or another with the males flying out and returning to spots within a meter of their
            previous perches. Of the 5 painted males, one returned soon after application of the
            thoracic paint dot and for three consecutive days, one returned soon after being marked
            and for two consecutive days, one returned for a single day, and two did not return
            after being marked. The arrival of the first male at any site took place no earlier than
            1111 E.D.T. and the duration of occupation of a site could last as long as slightly more
            than three hours, although some individuals were present for less than an hour.</p>
         <p> When males first arrived, abdomen dragging behavior was frequent in which the male
            walked generally upward along a grass stem or leaf with the head and the tip of the
            abdomen touching the substrate (see Figure 1 , ). As time passed marking behavior became
            less frequent. Thus on 29 July when a male marked pink thorax on 27 July was watched
            from 1151 to 1406 E.D.T, the male flew out from its perch (Figure 1 ) and spent a few
            seconds flying through the site before returning to the perch or shifting to a new perch
            a few centimeters distant. The male did so without marking 16 times in the first half
            hour while apparently marking grass stems after its departure from its perch on 19
            occasions; the same male left its perch without marking 42 times in the last half hour
            of observation and marked only 5 times. Likewise, on 6 August when a male with a blue
            thoracic dot (added on 5 August) was watched between 1111 and 1317 E.D.T. the wasp left
            its perch without marking 67 times in the first half hour while marking 34 times; the
            same male flew from its perch without abdomen dragging 43 times in the last half hour
            while marking only 10 times. Occasionally the male marked several different plant parts
            during one flight out from its perch. </p>
         <p> Only three interactions between <tp:taxon-name> C. clypeata </tp:taxon-name> were seen
            during the study, two involving a resident male that pursued another individual presumed
            to be a conspecific male for a short distance and one that resulted in a brief grapple
            on the ground between the resident and the other wasp. No nests of the wasp were found
            near the marking sites and no copulations were observed. </p>

         <p>Discussion</p>
         <p> The behavior of the male <tp:taxon-name> C. clypeata </tp:taxon-name> was very similar
            to that of other philanthine wasps seen apparently marking plant stems and leaves at
            certain restricted locations that they often defended from other males ( , ). Males
            walked along stems in the middle of the day (as is true for many species of
               <tp:taxon-name> Philanthus </tp:taxon-name> , see ) with their head and tip of
            abdomen lowered to touch the plant, presumably brushing the stem or leaf with a
            pheromone scent produced by cephalic glands to attract females ( , ). Abdomen-dragging
            occurs more often early in the daily residence of a male rather than later in
               <tp:taxon-name> P. basilaris </tp:taxon-name> ( ) as in <tp:taxon-name> C. clypeata
            </tp:taxon-name> . Male tenure at marking sites is often short, lasting only a few days
            at most ( , ). Copulations are rarely, if ever, seen in any marking species ( , , this
            study), even in those species that mark territories near nesting females ( ). </p>
         <p> The occurrence of abdomen dragging by at least two species of <tp:taxon-name> Cerceris
            </tp:taxon-name> and several others in the <tp:taxon-name>Cercerini</tp:taxon-name>
            (especially <tp:taxon-name> Eucerceris </tp:taxon-name> spp.) ( , ) suggest that this
            behavior is widespread in the <tp:taxon-name>Philanthinae</tp:taxon-name> and perhaps is
            ancestral in this group. The fact that abdomen dragging is absent in many species of
               <tp:taxon-name> Cerceris </tp:taxon-name> is indicative of the loss of the
            application of a sex pheromone in some of the <tp:taxon-name>Cercerini</tp:taxon-name> ,
            in addition to the modification of the application brushes found in many members of this
            group ( ) and changes in the cephalic glands that produce the sex attractant pheromone (
            ). </p>
