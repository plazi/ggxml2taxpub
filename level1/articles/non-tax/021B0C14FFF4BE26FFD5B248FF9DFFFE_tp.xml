         <title> Abstract </title>
         <p> We compared DNA barcoding to “traditional” taxonomic tools in clarifying relationships
            in complexes of closely related, putative “species” of
               <tp:taxon-name>Elachistinae</tp:taxon-name> moths (Gelechioidea:
               <tp:taxon-name>Elachistidae</tp:taxon-name> ) occurring in Australia . A 705 bp
            fragment of the 3’­end of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) was used. This mtDNA
            fragment did not differentiate between all species­level taxa that could be defined by
            morphological and/or ecological differences. Different evolutionary rates of COI among
            closely related lineages were observed. Although our findings are based on the
            variability of the 3’ end of the COI gene and not the 5’ end barcode fragment, we are
            convinced that thorough exploration of traditional morphology and ecology is a
            prerequisite for exploring insufficiently known taxonomies by the barcode approach. The
            sole use of COI barcoding, whether considering COI­5’ or COI­3’ fragment, may fail to
            recognize closely related species. Our results discourage this approach for delimitation
            of closely related species, but its use is encouraged as an additional tool for
            exploring little known taxonomies or as an identification tool for previously thoroughly
            studied species complexes. </p>

         <title> Introduction </title>
         <p> DNA barcoding proposes the use of DNA sequences to identify and classify an organism.
            The potential of a 650 bp fragment of the 5’­end of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase
            subunit I (COI)­based species identification system was proposed and partially
            demonstrated by . Among the benefits of this particular gene is its ease of acquisition
            and alignment, in addition to the fundamental criterion, a high level of diversity.
            Hence, the COI­5’ fragment has been proposed to serve as the core of a global
            bio­identification system for animals ( ). The performance of this system remains
            unclear, however, when applied to species that by traditional taxonomy are classified as
            very closely related (e.g. Prendini 2005). As and have discussed, a major unresolved
            issue is how closely the molecular taxa correspond to what traditional biologists
            recognize as species, i.e., species defined by DNA barcodes might not always correspond
            with species recognized by traditional ecological and morphological criteria. The
            question remains as how to delimit the species in question. The sole use of barcoding
            could incorrectly identify two members of a species as separate species, or two separate
            species as the same. Moreover, the conceptual issue of definition of species remains
            intact: if a genomic integrity of a species is assumed, how is it defined or
            characterized (see for discussion)? </p>
         <p> In this paper we present examples from Australian complexes of
               <tp:taxon-name>Elachistinae</tp:taxon-name> moths that presently are unresolved
            species, and demonstrate discrepancies in delimitation of species using ’traditional’
            criteria (i.e., ecological and morphological) versus the mitochondrial COI­3’ fragment.
            We also demonstrate problems in applying the use of this genomic fragment as a DNA
            barcode of species. </p>

         <title> Taxonomy </title>
         <p> Our focal taxon is <tp:taxon-name> Elachista </tp:taxon-name> , a large genus of
               <tp:taxon-name>Lepidoptera</tp:taxon-name> (Gelechioidea:
               <tp:taxon-name>Elachistidae</tp:taxon-name> ). <tp:taxon-name> Elachista
            </tp:taxon-name> comprises 550 named and two hundred discovered, yet unnamed species
            worldwide (L. Kaila, unpublished). The larvae of <tp:taxon-name> Elachista
            </tp:taxon-name> are leaf­miners specialising on monocotyledenous plants, especially
               <tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Cyperaceae</tp:taxon-name>
            . Their phylogeny was examined previously in a morphological analysis that used 131
            characters with 171 informative character states derived from adult and pupal morphology
            and larval ecology ( ), and later revisited by a more extensive morphology­based data
            set by , and in preparation). </p>
         <p> The taxonomic knowledge of <tp:taxon-name> Elachista </tp:taxon-name> has a long
            history in Europe where highly skilled amateurs have contributed detailed knowledge on
            the life histories and identification of species. <tp:taxon-name> Elachista species
            </tp:taxon-name> are generally morphologically rather uniform and thus difficult to
            identify based on external examination ( and references therein). During the past two
            decades the taxonomy of the genus has been under revision worldwide by LK, resulting in
            nineteen revisionary works ( , , , , 1997, 1998ab, 1999abc, 2005, , , , , Kaila et al.
            2003, , , ). The taxa examined in the present paper are included in an ongoing revision
            of the fauna of Australia (L. Kaila, in preparation). </p>
         <p> The aim of the present study is to elucidate the taxonomic utility of a sequence
            fragment, the 3’ end of the COI gene, for a group of very closely related, putative
            species of the genus <tp:taxon-name>Elachista</tp:taxon-name> . The taxa were selected
            for the present study from complexes of closely related species or populations which
            show differences in host plant selection, larval mine architecture, external appearance
            of the adults, and to some extent, morphology of the adult genitalia. The morphological
            differences, however, are slight, sometimes overlapping, and frequently only one sex can
            be identified by genital characteristics. Based on this kind of evidence the specimens
            were preliminarily classified to “species,” which are assumed to be cohesive
            genealogical lineages. This practice is in accordance with the current (traditional)
            concept of delineating species in the <tp:taxon-name>Elachistinae</tp:taxon-name> ,
            which, however, should not be equated with the “correct” way in our opinion. It is here
            used as a starting point towards a more integrative taxonomic approach (cf. ). The
            “species” are grouped into three informal species complexes, referred below to as
            “yellow” (name derived from the characteristic yellowish wing colour), “ <tp:taxon-name>
               Ficinia </tp:taxon-name> ” (name derived from the host plant genus), and “zigzagger”
            (name derived from the peculiar zigzagging larval mine) complexes. </p>

         <p> Molecular study </p>
         <p> The specimens used for molecular analysis are listed in Table 1. All of them were
            collected as larvae by LK thus confirming the correct host plant association. The larvae
            were reared in laboratory conditions using standard methods. The samples cover a modest
            subset of the taxonomic diversity of Australian representatives of <tp:taxon-name>
               Elachista </tp:taxon-name> subgenus <tp:taxon-name> Elachista </tp:taxon-name> that
            could be obtained for the molecular study. Presently at least 140 <tp:taxon-name>
               Elachista species </tp:taxon-name> are recorded from Australia (L. Kaila,
            unpublished), of which fourteen are treated here. </p>
         <p> DNA was extracted usually from legs or head+thorax of single individuals from dry,
            pinned specimens (Table 1). They are preserved as DNA voucher specimens in the
            Zoological Museum of the Finnish Museum of Natural History (MZH) DNA voucher specimen
            collection, and labeled as listed in Table 1. DNA was extracted using the Nucleospin
            Tissue Kit (Machery­Nagel, Düren, Germany ) according to manufacturer’s protocols, and
            re­suspended in 50 µl of ultra­pure water. </p>
         <p> PCR’s were carried out in 25 µl reactions containing 1–2 µl DNA extract, 1 µl of each
            primer (at 10 pmol/ l), 0.25 µl of Amplitaq DNA polymerase (5U / µl), 2 µl 2.5 mM MgCl 2
            , 2.5 µl 10X Buffer II (Applied Biosystems) and 4 µl 200 mM dNTP (GeneAmp) and water.
            Thermocycler conditions were initial denaturing at 95 C 2 min, 29 cycles of 30 s
            denaturing at 94 C, 30 s annealing at 49 C, 2 min extension at 72 C, followed by a final
            extension of 8 min at 72°C. PCR products were purified using the GFX PCR Purification
            Kit (Amersham Biotech) and then sequenced (using the PCR primers) in both directions
            using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit vs. 1.1 (Applied Biosystems) at
            onefourth of the recommended volumes on ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer. The primers used
            for amplifying and sequencing the COI­3’ were C1­J­2183 (alias “Jerry”, 5’
            CAACATTTATTTTGATTTTTTGG 3’) and tl2­n­3014 (alias “Pat”, 5’ TCCAATGCACTAATCTGCCATATTA
            3’) ( ). </p>
         <p> Sequences were assembled and edited using Sequence Navigator (version 1.01). The
            alignment of the protein­coding COI was straightforward. Phylogenetic relationships of
            included terminals were estimated (using equal weights) using the parsimony program NoNa
            vs. 2.0 ( ) using the command line “hold 100000; hold*; hold/50, mult*100; max*;”.
            Bremer ( , ) values were estimated using NoNa and Jackknife support values using
            WinClada ( ). </p>
         <p> Morphological study </p>
         <p> Adult specimens and their pupal exuviae were examined externally using a
            stereomicroscope, in order to evaluate possible differences in their colouration and
            wing shape. Extensive series, whenever available, were dissected using standard
            procedure ( ). The genital morphology was examined using a Wild M10 stereomicroscope
            (maximum magnification 512x and Leitz Diaplan phase contrast compound microscope
            (maximum magnification 1560x ). The terminology of anatomy follows . </p>

         <title> Results </title>
         <p> Molecular study </p>
         <p> We obtained 705 nucleotides of the 3’ end of the COI gene spanning nucleotide positions
            2239 to 2944 in COI (numbering is based on <tp:taxon-name> Drosophila yakuba
            </tp:taxon-name> sequence; ) for 47 ingroup specimens belonging to 14 putative
            morphospecies and two outgroup taxa. The mean AT was 72.2 %. </p>
         <p> The number of parsimony informative sites was 120. Parsimony analysis using NoNa found
            two equally parsimonious trees (length 290 steps). Their strict consensus cladogram with
            Bremer support values and Jackknife support values is shown in Fig. 1 . COI resolves
            species groups well, but is invariant in four cases of putative recently diverged
            species within the ‘zigzagger ’complex, and within the two sections of “zigzaggers” at
            most three bp differences are observed. For species in the ‘yellow’ clade complex we
            obtained intraspecifically identical sequences that support morphological taxonomy. On
            the other hand, the amount of the intraspecific variation of included taxa varied
            considerably between the complexes. </p>
         <p> Uncorrected interspecific pairwise divergence between yellow 1 and yellow 2 was 4.54%,
            and that between <tp:taxon-name> Ficinia </tp:taxon-name> 1 and <tp:taxon-name> Ficinia
            </tp:taxon-name> 2 samples ranged from 3.69% to 4.40%. Between the taxa of the A section
            of the zigzagger complex these value ranged from 0.0% to 0.85%. Between the taxa of the
            B section of the zigzagger complex they ranged from 0.0% to 0.71%. The divergence
            between the taxa of A and B sections ranged from 3.55% to 4.11%. The divergence between
            the yellow and <tp:taxon-name> Ficinia </tp:taxon-name> complexes (yellow 1 vs.
               <tp:taxon-name> Ficinia </tp:taxon-name> 1) ranged between 5.96%–6.95%, and
            divergences between yellow and <tp:taxon-name> Ficinia </tp:taxon-name> complex taxa vs.
            zigzagger complex’s taxa were of the same magnitude. </p>
         <p> Uncorrected intraspecific pairwise divergences of the yellow 1 was 0.0%, within
               <tp:taxon-name> Ficinia </tp:taxon-name> ­group complex taxa the values ranged from
            0.28–1.56%. Within the A section of the zigzagger complex values ranged from 0.0% to
            0.43%, and within the B section values were 0.0% to 0.85%, respectively. </p>
         <p> The division of the zigzagger complex into A and B sections, based on the presence/
            absence of the female signum (for definition see ), was supported by the sequence data.
            Intra­ and interspecific uncorrected pairwise divergences between specimens and
            hypothetical taxa of the zigzagger complex were almost completely overlapping, with
            intraspecific divergences greater than interspecific in some cases. Therefore, within
            the zigzagger B complex of species the morphospecies B1 appears paraphyletic with
            respect to two other species, and B2 appears as polyphyletic. </p>
         <p>The intraspecific divergence ranges for zigzagger A and B complexes overlap with the
            interspecific ranges between taxa of these complexes; hence, intraspecific divergences
            are bigger than interspecific values in some instances.</p>
         <p> Study of morphology and ecology </p>
         <p> External appearance is similar between <tp:taxon-name> Ficinia </tp:taxon-name> complex
            species 1 and 2 ( Figs. 2 A–F ). The taxa exhibit differences in genitalia as follows.
            Males: The uncus lobes are smaller in sp. 1 than in sp. 2, the valva is medially
            narrowed in sp. 2, not in sp. 1, and the digitate process of sp. 1 is distally curved,
            blunt­tipped in sp. 2 ( Figs. 3 A, B ). Females: Sp. 1: basal dilation of the ductus
            seminalis is naked, and its colliculum is slightly longer than antrum, occupying half of
            the length of caudal part of ductus bursae. Sp. 2: basal dilation of the ductus
            seminalis is sparsely covered with small sclerotised internal granules; the colliculum
            of sp. 2 is almost twice as long as the antrum, occupying 2/3 of the length of the
            caudal part of ductus bursae ( Figs. 4 A, B ). The biologies of <tp:taxon-name> Ficinia
            </tp:taxon-name> 1 and 2 are similar ­ both species tunnel under the epidermis of the
            culm of <tp:taxon-name> Ficinia nodosa </tp:taxon-name> , making a straight yellowish
            mine. </p>
         <p> External appearance is similar between yellow complex species 1 and 2. ( Figs. 2 C, D
            ). The taxa exhibit differences in genitalia as follows. Males: the distal opening of
            the phallus is dorsally extended as a small and indistinctly delimited
            rounded–triangular extension in sp. 1; it bears a small but distinctive dorsolaterally
            directed triangular lobe in sp. 2 ( Fig. 3 C, D ). Females: the ostium bursae of sp. 2.
            is narrower than that of sp. 1. In sp.1 it occupies about 1/3 of the distance between
            apophyses anteriores, in sp. 2 about 1/4 of the distance between apophyses anteriores.
            The lateral margin of the antrum is somewhat convex in sp. 1, straight in sp. 2 ( Figs.
            4 D, E ). The biologies of yellow complex 1 and 2 are similar. Both species make a
            straight mine on the leaf of <tp:taxon-name>Lepidosperma</tp:taxon-name> ?elatius
            [nomenclature and taxonomy of the plant genus <tp:taxon-name> Lepidosperma
            </tp:taxon-name> ( <tp:taxon-name>Cyperaceae</tp:taxon-name> ) is somewhat unclear (J.
            Bruhl, personal communication)]. </p>
         <p> External appearance differs to some extent among the taxa of the zigzagger complex (
            Fig. 5 ). A2 and A6 are the largest, and A4 is the smallest and most narrow­winged. A1,
            A3, or A5 can hardly be distinguished from each other on the basis of their appearance
            only. All taxa of the A section are greyer than those of B section whose forewings are
            powdered with brownish scales as well. B1, B2, and B3 are similar to each other.
            Examination of a large number of samples of the B1–B3 taxa implies, however, the
            following trends: B2 tends to be the darkest, brownest, and most broad­winged of these
            taxa; and B3 has quite bright black markings in the distal part of its forewing. </p>
         <p> The male genitalia of taxa of the zigzagger complex are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. A 2
            seems consistently distinguishable from others by the thin basal half of the phallus (
            Fig. 6 B ). The cucullus of the valva is more expanded in A6 than in the other species.
            The juxta lobes of A5 differ in their shape from the other species ( Fig. 6 E ).
            Although the shape of the spinose knob of the gnathos is somewhat variable within the
            taxa, it nevertheless distinguishes A2 and B3 from others, as being basally broader in
            these taxa than in others. </p>
         <p> A summary of the further male genital characters of the taxa of the zigzagger complex
            is given in Table 3 . The females of this groupcomplex ( Figs. 8–10 ) are keyed here: </p>

         <p> 7. Females of <tp:taxon-name> Elachista </tp:taxon-name> zigzagger complex B1, B2 and
            B3 only identifiable from immature stages. </p>
         <p> There appear to be no differences in the immature stages or the life histories among
            yellow complex species or among the <tp:taxon-name> Ficinia </tp:taxon-name> complex
            species. The pupal exuviae of the taxa of the zigzagger complex are characterised by the
            dark brownish grey mesial area of the ventral side ( Fig. 11 ). There appear to be
            constant differences in this character among some taxa of this complex: A2 has most
            expanded dark area with forewing veins visible as pale only laterally; the A taxa have
            in general larger dark area than B taxa. The larval mines of the zigzagger complex taxa
            A1, A2, and B2 are shown in Fig. 12 . The biological traits of the taxa of the zigzagger
            complex are summarised here. Some differentiating traits are summarised in Table 3 . </p>
         <p>The taxon A1 inhabits shaded or half­open dry sites where its host plants,</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name> Lepidosperma concavum </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> L. laterale
            </tp:taxon-name> , grow. The egg is laid near base of the leaf near the leaf margin. The
            larva starts mining during summer and completes development in late autumn–early winter.
            The full­grown larva hibernates in the mine until August. The initial stage of the mine
            is narrow, about 15 cm long and visible on both sides of the leaf, with a characteristic
            pattern. The mine first runs about 4 cm straight upwards along the margin, then makes a
            100° angle and moves to the other edge where it runs along the edge another centimetre,
            and again moves back in 100° angle. It makes 4–6 such turns, after which the larva turns
            to mine downwards. Then the mine abruptly broadens, filling the whole width of the leaf
            forming a 3 cm long swollen chamber. The lower part of the chamber is yellowish, the
            upper part green. If the small larva is parasitised, the sharp angles of the mine are
            more wavy and undulating. The larva exits the mine during August. Over a hundred mines
            were examined. </p>
         <p> Larvae of A2 were found in moist sandstone sites with open stone surfaces surrounded by
            dense bush vegetation and small eucalypts. <tp:taxon-name> Lepidosperma concavum
            </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> L. viscidum </tp:taxon-name> have been recorded as
            the host plants. The egg is laid near base of the leaf near margin. The initial stage of
            the mine is narrow, about 20 cm long, otherwise similar to that of A3, but the intervals
            of the nearly right­angled turns are about 10–15 mm from each other, usually not quite
            reaching the margin of the leaf on one side. Every other across­leaf section of the mine
            is visible only on the upper side of the leaf, while the remaining are visible only on
            the lower side. Then the mine abruptly broadens encompassing nearly the entire width of
            the leaf, and the larva mines downwards making a 5–7 cm long swollen chamber. The larva
            feeds during autumn and early winter, and appears to hibernate as a full­grown larva
            within the mine. The larva exits the mine during August. The initial mines of two larvae
            have been observed in the same leaf, but under such conditions apparently only one of
            them is able to survive. About 50 mines were examined. </p>
         <p> </p>
         <p> Larvae of A3 were found in shaded and open forest in rather dry sites where its host
            plants, <tp:taxon-name> Lepidosperma curtisiae </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>
               Lepidosperma sp. </tp:taxon-name> nr. <tp:taxon-name> laterale </tp:taxon-name> ,
            grow. The egg is laid near the base of the leaf near the margin. The initial mine is
            narrow, 5–10 cm long in <tp:taxon-name> L. curtisiae </tp:taxon-name> , 15 cm in L. sp.,
            similar to that of A2. The mine runs, however, along margins of the leaf. The intervals
            of the nearly right­angled turns are about 5 mm from each other, and every second
            across­leaf section of the mine is visible only on the upper, every second on the lower
            side of the leaf. Then the mine abruptly broadens filling the whole width of the leaf,
            and the larva mines downwards making a 2–5 cm long swollen chamber. In <tp:taxon-name>
               L. curtisiae </tp:taxon-name> the leaf soon withers above the mine. The larva feeds
            during autumn and early winter, and appears to hibernate as a full­grown larva within
            the mine. It exits the mine during August. About 50 mines were examined. </p>
         <p> </p>
         <p> Larvae of A4 were found in an exposed site where its host plant, <tp:taxon-name>
               Lepidosperma sp. </tp:taxon-name> , grows. The unidentified host plant species is
            characterised by its cylindrical culm (flower stem) transsection. The initial mine is
            narrow, about 10 cm long. The initial mine resembles that of the other species in the
            zigzagger complex, making turns at right angle at intervals of 5 mm on its way upwards
            the culm. Finally the mine abruptly broadens, and the larva mines downwards making a 4
            cm long chamber which occupies the entire space of the culm. The larva feeds during
            winter and exits the mine during July. Fifteen mines were examined. </p>
         <p> Larvae of A5 were found in a shaded site where its host plant,
               <tp:taxon-name>Lepidosperma longitudinale</tp:taxon-name> , grows. The egg is laid
            near base of the leaf near margin. The initial mine is narrow, about 15 cm long. The
            mine first runs 1 cm straight upwards along the margin, then makes a right angle and
            moves to the other edge where it runs along the edge 7 mm , and again moves back in a
            right angle. The intervals of the right­angled turns are regular, 7 mm from each other,
            and every other across­leaf section of the mine is visible only on the upper side of the
            leaf, the remaining only on lower side. Then the mine abruptly broadens, and the larva
            mines downwards making a 4 cm long swollen chamber, which occupies two­thirds of the
            width of the leaf. The larva feeds during winter and larva exits the mine during July.
            Thirty mines were examined. </p>
         <p> Larvae of A6 were found in an open, moist site in a sparse stand of its host plant,
               <tp:taxon-name> Lepidosperma longitudinale </tp:taxon-name> . The egg is laid near
            base of the leaf near margin. The initial mine is narrow, about 25 cm long. The mine
            first runs 6 cm straight upwards along the margin, then makes a right angle and moves to
            the other edge where it runs along the edge 1 cm , and again moves back in a right
            angle. The intervals of the right­angled turns are regular, 1 cm from each other, and
            every second across­leaf section of the mine is visible only on upper, every second on
            lower side of the leaf. Then the mine abruptly broadens filling the whole width of the
            leaf, and the larva mines downwards making a 5 cm long swollen chamber which occupies
            most of the width of the leaf. The larva feeds during winter and exits the mine during
            August. Fifteen mines were examined. </p>
         <p> Larvae of B1 have been found in open and shaded sites mining leaves of various
               <tp:taxon-name> Lepidosperma species. </tp:taxon-name> The egg is laid near base of
            the leaf near margin. The initial mine is narrow, about 25 cm long. The mine first runs
            some centimetres straight upwards near the margin, then makes a 90–100° angle and moves
            to the other edge where it runs along the edge 0.5 cm , and again moves back in a
            similar angle. In narrow­leaved host plants this is repeated up to 10 times. In
               <tp:taxon-name> L. gladiatum </tp:taxon-name> the shape of the mine is different: the
            larva does not reach the edge of the leaf but mines within the median 2/3 of </p>
         <p> the leaf width. It makes a few turns of 100°, after which the turns become more
            frequent. The larva makes 100° angle turns in every 2–4 mm , after which the mine
            continues as irregularly undulating for some centimetres. Every second across­leaf
            section of the mine is visible only on upper, every second on lower side of the leaf.
            Finally the mine abruptly broadens and the larva mines downwards making a 5 cm long
            swollen chamber which occupies half of the width of the leaf. The larva feeds during
            winter and exits the mine during July­August. Over two hundred mines were examined. </p>
         <p> Larvae of B2 were found in shady lakeshore sites mining leaves of an unidentified very
            large <tp:taxon-name> Lepidosperma species </tp:taxon-name> characterised by the spongy
            matrix of its leaves. The initial mine is narrow, about 25 cm long. The mine first runs
            5 cm straight upwards near the margin, then makes a 100° angle and moves to the other
            edge where it runs along the edge 5 millimetres, and again moves back in a 100° angle.
            The larva makes a few such turns, after which the turns become more frequent, the larva
            mining parallel to the leaf edge 2 mm , and makes 110° angle turns whenever it
            encounters the leaf margin. This is repeated about five times. The mine runs within the
            epidermis, and is equally faintly visible in both sides of the leaf as a reddish brown
            line. Finally the mine abruptly broadens and the larva mines downwards making a 5 cm
            long swollen chamber which occupies half of the width of the leaf. The larva feeds
            during winter and exits the mine during July­ August. Sixty mines were examined. </p>
         <p> Larvae of B3 were found in open sandy site mining leaves of <tp:taxon-name>
               Lepidosperma gladiatum </tp:taxon-name> . The egg is laid near base of the leaf near
            margin. The initial mine is narrow, about 25 cm long. The mine first runs 10 cm straight
            upwards near the margin, then makes a 100° angle and moves to the other edge where it
            runs along the edge 1 cm , and again moves back in a 100° angle. The larva makes a few
            such turns, after which the turns become more frequent, the larva not mining parallel to
            the leaf edge at all, but makes 100° angle turns whenever it encounters the leaf margin.
            This is repeated about five times. Then the larva again changes the style as continuing
            near midrib of the leaf, the mine continuing as irregularly undulating for about five
            centimetres. Every other across­leaf section of the mine is visible only on the upper
            surface of the leaf, the remainder only on lower surface. Finally the mine abruptly
            broadens and the larva mines downwards making a 5 cm long swollen chamber which occupies
            half of the width of the leaf. The larva feeds during winter and exits the mine during
            July­August. Thirty mines were examined. </p>
         <p> Taxonomic conclusions </p>
         <p> Integrating the evidence from the 3’ end of CO1 mitochondrial DNA sequences, biological
            traits of larvae, and pupal and adult morphology, we conclude the following. Yellow 1
            and yellow 2 are distinct species supported by MtDNA and genital morphology.
               <tp:taxon-name> Ficinia </tp:taxon-name> 1 and 2 are distinct species based on
            similar reasoning. The A and B sections of the zigzagger complex are distinct,
            monophyletic entities. </p>
         <p>A1 merits species rank based on its characteristic larval mine and its female genital
            morphology; the genomic data neither strongly support nor contradict this
            conclusion.</p>
         <p>A2 and A3 are distinct from other taxa based on their characteristic larval mines and
            their male and female genital morphology; the mitochondrial data neither strongly
            support nor contradict this conclusion. The two species cannot be distinguished from
            each other based on mtDNA data (uncorrected pairwise divergence 0.0%). Characteristics
            of their adult external appearance, as well as both their male and female genitalia,
            suggest that they belong to separate cohesive genealogical units, i.e., are distinct
            species.</p>
         <p>A4 merits species rank owing to its life history, adult external appearance, and female
            genitalia; the mtDNA data neither strongly support nor contradict this conclusion.</p>
         <p>A5 merits species rank owing to its life history and male and female genitalia; the
            mtDNA data neither strongly support nor contradict this conclusion.</p>
         <p>A6 merits species rank owing to its life history, adult external appearance and male and
            female genitalia; the mtDNA data neither strongly support nor contradict this
            conclusion.</p>
         <p> As here delimited, B1 appears paraphyletic with respect to B2 and B3 on the basis of
            the mtDNA data. B2 appears polyphyletic. The samples LK 29 and 47, resolved as a
            separate clade and as sister clade of the remaining B section, are allopatric to the
            other B1 samples and also somewhat externally different. Their status as representing B1
            could (and perhaps should) be questioned. If they were excluded, B3 would be pulled off
            from the remaining B clade, though without molecular synapomorphies. B3 is distinct from
            others according to the male genitalia. B1 cannot be differentiated from B2 by
            morphology either. The sole difference among these taxa seems to be the characteristic
            mine structure of B2. It is, however, noteworthy that among B1 samples (as here
            delimited) there is more variation in this trait than in the other taxa. Therefore, the
            present evidence is not sufficient to delineate B1; the status of B2 is unclear. B3 is
            distinct, allopatric taxon in relation of the other B samples; its rank is a matter of
            opinion and should be consistent with the ranking of other similar taxa of
               <tp:taxon-name> Elachista </tp:taxon-name> . </p>

         <title> Discussion </title>
         <p> Barcoding as a method for recognizing taxa is independent of questions as to whether
            individual taxa are species, what species are or should be, and where they fit in a
            unified tree of life ( , ). We agree with this. The delimitation of species in
            problematic situations should be based on maximal evidence derived from different
            sources, including morphological and ecological data and molecular evidence from more
            than one genomic fragment as already suggested by , see also ). We suggest that the use
            of COI barcoding in species identification should be restricted to previously thoroughly
            studied specific cases, such as the pest ermine moths of the genus <tp:taxon-name>
               Yponomeuta </tp:taxon-name> ( <tp:taxon-name>Yponomeutidae</tp:taxon-name> ) (e.g. ). </p>
         <p> Our results support previous studies on the uninformativeness of the barcoding gene in
            providing information in cases with recently diverged species. Of the nine putative
            species in the complex of Australian zigzagger species, only two groups (A and B) were
            recovered with consistent robust molecular support. Based on morphological and
            biological evidence, both of these groups segregate into several species. The taxon
            zigzagger B2 displays a distinctive shape in its larval mine architecture, which
            supports its status as a distinct species; however, samples representing it (LK 55, 56,
            59 and 60) were not nested together in the COI tree ( Fig. 1 ). Another species group,
            the <tp:taxon-name> Ficinia </tp:taxon-name> ­complex of taxa, showed more intraspecific
            variation in their COI sequence within one putatively conspecific population (all larvae
            sampled from a single tussock of the host plant) than did putatively different species
            of the zigzagger species complex. These complexes are (very) closely related to each
            other, yet they show distinctly different rates of differentiation. This finding argues
            against generalisations about the utility of this single gene fragment in species
            delimitation, unless supported by other kinds of evidence. </p>
         <p> argued that DNA barcoding is not an end in itself, but may aid research and boost the
            rate of discovery. Our experience gives credit to the potential utility of routine
            barcoding as a one source of taxonomic information, as even our small sample detected
            one species (yellow complex 2) morphologically so close to others that it had remained
            unrecognised. After characterised by the COI sequence, diagnostic morphological features
            subsequently were recognised. Barcoding of a COI fragment is certainly a useful source
            of information, among others sources, to explore the taxonomy of insufficiently known
            organisms. Nevertheless, caution should be taken when interpreting the patterns observed
            from a single gene sequence. We emphasize that DNA taxonomy should be firmly anchored
            with morphological taxonomy and take into account biological traits of the organisms
            under study. Only in this way can pitfalls caused by features such as genetic
            polymorphisms older than the divergences of the species in question ( , ) be avoided.
