Abstract

</title>
         <p>
Phenotypes of distantly related species may converge through adaptation to similar habitats and/or because they share biological constraints that limit the phenotypic variants produced. Acommon theme in bats is the sympatric occurrence of cryptic species that are convergent in morphology but divergent in echolocation frequency, suggesting that echolocation may facilitate niche partitioning, reducing competition. If so, allopatric populations freed from competition, could converge in both morphology and echolocation provided they occupy similar niches or share biological constraints. We investigated the evolutionary history of a widely distributed African horseshoe bat, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinolophus darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
, in the context of phenotypic convergence. We used phylogenetic inference to identify and date lineage divergence together with phenotypic comparisons and ecological niche modelling to identify morphological and geographical correlates of those lineages. Our results indicate that 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
is paraphyletic, the eastern and western parts of its distribution forming two distinct non-sister lineages that diverged ~9.7 Mya. We retain 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
for the eastern lineage and argue that the western lineage, currently the sub-species 

R

. 

d. 
<tp:taxon-name>damarensis</tp:taxon-name>

, should be elevated to full species status. 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. damarensis
</tp:taxon-name>
comprises two lineages that diverged ~5 Mya. Our findings concur with patterns of divergence of other co-distributed taxa which are associated with increased regional aridification between 7-5 Mya suggesting possible vicariant evolution. The morphology and echolocation calls of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. damarensis
</tp:taxon-name>
are convergent despite occupying different biomes. This suggests that adaptation to similar habitats is not responsible for the convergence. Furthermore, 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
forms part of a clade comprising species that are bigger and echolocate at lower frequencies than 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
, suggesting that biological constraints are unlikely to have influenced the convergence. Instead, the striking similarity in morphology and sensory biology are probably the result of neutral evolutionary processes, resulting in the independent evolution of similar phenotypes.

Introduction

</title>
         <p>
Geographic variation in fitness-enhancing traits is often attributed to local selection on populations occupying diverse habitats [

– 

]. These traits can however also be highly convergent even in populations occupying different habitats. Phenotypic convergence by organisms in different habitats has often been attributed to adaptation to similar ecological niches [4,5]. Such convergence has often been used as evidence for adaptation but recently the causal relationship between convergence and adaptation has been questioned [

] with the realization that other factors such as random genetic drift can also lead to convergence [

]. This can make the interpretation of convergence and its biological significance problematical.
</p>
         <p>
For example, when species designations are predominantly informed by phenotypic traits, strong convergence in such traits can mask not only the existence of cryptic species but also the causes of speciation. Molecular tools have been instrumental in revealing cryptic biodiversity in such evolutionarily diverse groups as birds [

], mammals [

], echinoderms [

], anurans [

], fish [

, 

] and arthropods [

], with important consequences for regional biodiversity planning [

].
</p>
         <p>
Many phenotypically cryptic species uncovered so far cooccur e.g. [

, 

] raising questions about how they can co-exist given their convergent phenotypes. Competition theory holds that ecologically similar co-existing species must partition their resources [

, 

]. It is possible that very small differences in morphology, for example, can result in the use of different ecological niche space, allowing similar species to co-exist e.g. [17,18]. Alternatively, as has been discovered in bats, subtle niche partitioning amongst morphologically convergent species can be mediated by differences in their sensory biology [

– 

].
</p>
         <p>
Morphology in bats can be highly convergent [

– 

] because many of them occupy similar ecological niches [25,26]. Consequently many species designations based on shared morphology and ecology have been found, through the use of molecular techniques, to consist of both divergent clades as well as closely related species complexes [

, 

]. In recent years several morphologically cryptic bat species, confirmed by genetic analyses, have been uncovered largely as a result of differences in their sensory systems viz. the use of different echolocation call frequencies [19,20,28–31]. The evolution of highly convergent morphology in genetically distinct, yet sympatric, species with divergent echolocation frequencies is a recurrent theme in bats e.g. [19,20,24,29]. This has led to the suggestion that echolocation may be implicated in evolutionary diversification via partitioning of prey and/or habitat [

] or discrete frequency bands. Partitioning of the latter supposedly facilitates intraspecific communication [27,29,33-35] within areas where congenerics co-occur. Social information may be encoded in small intraspecific differences in frequency [

] such that divergence in sensory traits may permit the co-existence of species with similar morphology. Acoustic divergence in sympatry could be an example of character displacement under interspecific competition provided divergence occurred as a result of such competition [36,37]. If patterns of convergent morphology with divergent acoustic signals are the result of co-occurrence it might be expected that allopatric populations could converge in both morphology and acoustic signals provided they occupy similar ecological niches albeit in different habitats and/or selection for adaptation to local habitats is weak. Convergence in allopatry can also be facilitated by non-adaptive processes such as random genetic drift in combination with shared biological constraints. Constraints limit the variation that can be produced such that genetically divergent lineages converge upon the same phenotype even in the absence of selection [

].
</p>
         <p>
Significant convergence in morphology and sensory systems is characteristic of the horseshoe bats (
<tp:taxon-name>Rhinolophidae</tp:taxon-name>
) throughout their distribution in the Palaearctic, Indo-Malay and Afrotropic ecoregions. All species are placed in a single genus (
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinolophus
</tp:taxon-name>
) [

] and divided into two major phylogenetic clades defined by their geography: ‘African’ and ‘Oriental’ [

]. The African rhinolophids currently comprise 27 species [

] and at least one species with a wide geographic range has been found to include cryptic lineages [

].
</p>
         <p>
Here we investigate the evolution of phenotypic convergence in allopatry in a widely distributed southern African bat species, Darling’s horseshoe bat, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinolophus darlingi
Andersen, 1905
</tp:taxon-name>
. Convergence – the independent evolution of similar phenotypes amongst different evolutionary lineages [

] – predicts that two or more species under consideration would be more similar to each other than either is to their nearest common ancestor or to their closest relatives [

, 

]. We test these predictions using phylogenetic comparisons on morphological, echolocation, and environmental data, sampling across the range of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
in southern Africa. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinolophus darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
has a wide but clearly disjunct distribution in southern Africa where it spans the sub-continent from the mesic east to the xeric west across several biomes including woodland and grasslands in the east and arid savanna, Succulent- and Nama-Karoo, shrubland and desert in the west [41,42]. Several sub-species are currently recognised [

] and molecular evidence suggests that 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
may be polytypic. Individuals in the western half of 
South Africa
revealed withinregion sequence divergence at cytochrome b of 2.5% compared to between region divergence with individuals from eastern 
South Africa
and 
Swaziland
of 10 - 15% [

]. We therefore also included several other rhinolophid species in our analyses to test monophyly within 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
and to accurately establish the geographic boundaries of the lineages uncovered.

Sampling

</title>
         <p>
In the eastern part of its range 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
is distributed from south-western 
Malawi
, to north-western 
Mozambique
, throughout 
Zimbabwe
, north and eastern 
Botswana
and the north-eastern region of 
South Africa
including 
Swaziland
. In the west it is currently known from north-west 
South Africa
westward through 
Namibia
, and just entering into south-west 
Angola
(
Figure 1
; [

]). These geographically isolated distributions coincide with two of the currently recognized subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>

[

]. The 
holotype

d. 
<tp:taxon-name>damarensis</tp:taxon-name>

(
TM
9474) was from Oserikari, Damaraland, Okahandja District, in 
Namibia
(
Figure 1
). For this study, 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals were sampled together with several other rhinolophid species (
Table S1
and Appendix S 
1 in
File S1) at several sites in 
Namibia
, 
South Africa
and 
Zimbabwe
from 2008 to 2012 (
Figure 1
). Species identifications were based on Monadjem et al. [

]. Wherever possible one male and one female were taken as vouchers from each site sampled. All other bats were released unharmed back into their roosts after data and tissue sample collection. We also obtained morphometric data and tissue samples from museum specimens of

Phylogenetic reconstruction and dating

</title>
         <p>
We reconstructed the evolutionary relationships within and between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
(
sensu lato
) and several other rhinolophid species from Africa, Asia and Europe using the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene and the nuclear marker thyrotropin beta chain precursor (THY).

Sample collection and DNA sequencing.
Tissue samples for genetic analyses were taken from the tail membranes of captured bats using 
3 mm
diameter skin biopsy punches (stored in 70% ethanol), from pectoral muscle extracted prior to specimen preparation, or from dried skins of museum specimens.
</p>
         <p>
Total genomic DNA was extracted from samples using a DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen; Appendix S2 and File S1) following the manufacturer’s instructions and stored at 4°C. Two dried skin samples from museum 
holotype
specimens (
TM
9474 [

R

. 

d. 
<tp:taxon-name>damarensis</tp:taxon-name>

] and 
TM
2476 [

R
. d. barbetonensis

]) were also used in the study. The samples were extracted using a QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen) (see Appendix S 
2 in
File S1). In total we sequenced 77 individuals for the nuclear marker and 48 for the mitochondrial marker. Sample details and collection site coordinates are reported in 

Table S 
2

in File S1 (Appendix S 
1 in
FileS1).
</p>
         <p>
DNA extractions were diluted where necessary to achieve a final concentration of approximately 
40 ng
/μl (using the NanoDrop 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, 
USA
). To amplify the cyt b region we used published primers L1472ag (5´
-ATG ATA TGA AAA ACC ATC GTT G-
3´) and H15915 (5´
- TTT CCN TTT CTG GTT TAC AAG AC-
3´) [

]. For the museum specimens the degraded DNA template required the use of a primerless PCR followed by a PCR in which multiple primer pairs were used to successfully amplify the target region. These multiple primers were specifically developed for this study (see Table S4 and Appendix S 
1 in
File S1). The nuclear THY gene was amplified using published primers (5´
- GGG TAT GTA GTT CAT CTT ACT TC-
3´and 5´
-GGG ATC CTG GTA TTT CTA CAG TCT TG-
3´) from [

] which were modified from those developed by [

]. Optimal concentrations and temperature conditions for PCRs are given in the Information (Appendix S 
2 in
File S1). PCRs were performed on a GeneAmp 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) and checked under UV in 1% ethidium bromide agarose gel. Museum DNA template was successfully amplified using a combination of ‘primerless’ PCR reactions together with coldstart PCR design (Appendix S 
2 in
File S1). PCR products were purified using a Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System (Promega) and sequenced in both directions using BigDye 3.1 chemistry on an ABI 3730 XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems at Macrogen Inc., 
South Korea
).

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses.
DNA sequences were edited in SeqMan II v6.00 (DNASTAR Inc. 
USA
) and ChromasPro v1.5 (Technelysium PTY Ltd., 
Australia
) and consensus sequences compiled from the reverse and forward sequence files. The minimum overlap of the two sequences was 150bp for cyt b and 350bp for the THY sequences. The final alignment for both sets of sequences comprised 32 unique cyt b sequences (Genbank accession numbers given in Table S3 and Appendix S 
1 in
File S1) and 43 unique THY sequences (Genbank accession numbers given in Table S 
3 in
File S1). The alignments were edited manually and translated into amino acids to verify the reading frame in MEGA4 [

]. The translated alignments had no gaps or stop codons. Sequences from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hipposideros
</tp:taxon-name>
spp. and other rhinolophids were downloaded from Genbank [

] and used as outgroups in the phylogenetic analysis (Table S3 and Appendix S 
1 in
FileS1).
</p>
         <p>
Descriptive statistics for the two sequence data sets were calculated in MEGA4. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using Maximum Parsimony (MP), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference methods. For MP and ML, analyses were carried out in PAUP 4.0b10 [

] using PaupUp graphical interface [

]. Tree reconstruction using Bayesian inference was carried out in MrBayes v3.1.2 [

]. We also estimated the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for a number of clades of interest using BEAST v1.7.4 [

]. (Details for all analyses are given in Supporting Information, Appendix S2).

Echolocation

</title>
         <p>
Echolocation calls were recorded from hand-held bats of several species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rhinolophidae</tp:taxon-name>
(
Table S1
and Appendix S 
1 in
File S1). Each bat was positioned 
10 cm
in front of an Avisoft Ultrasound Gate 416 (Avisoft Bioacoustics, 
Germany
) microphone. Calls were recorded directly onto a notebook computer with Avisoft SasLab Pro software v5.1.23 using a sampling rate of 500,000 Hz. Recordings were slowed down by ten and were analysed using BatSound Pro v3.20, (Pettersson Elektronik AB, 
Uppsala
, 
Sweden
). The resting frequency (
RF
; 
Table S1
and Appendix S 
1 in
File S1) – the frequency of highest energy in the constant component of the calls emitted when stationary – was determined for each bat from the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) power spectrum (size 1024 samples; frequency resolution 684 Hz). The resting frequency for each bat was taken as the average resting frequency of five to ten high-quality calls (calls in which the amplitude of the signal was at least three times higher than that of the background noise as displayed on the oscillogram).

Morphometric measurements from vouchers and museum specimens

</p>
         <p>
Skull and post-cranial morphology.
Skull and post-cranial parameters were measured to the nearest 
0.01mm
, using digital callipers, on each voucher specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
. Several other rhinolophid species (
<tp:taxon-name>
R. blasii
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. capensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. clivosus
</tp:taxon-name>
) that are similar in size and/or use similar echolocation calls to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Table S1
and Appendix S 
1 in
File S1 Supporting Information) and are thus likely to be confused with it were also measured. The parameters we measured were forearm length (FA); tail length (TL); tibia length (TB); ear length (EL); standard skull measurements (following Csorba et al., 2003) and standard wing elements (
Table S1
and Appendix S 
1 in
File S1 Supporting Information; [

]).
</p>
         <p>
Noseleafs.
The shapes of noseleafs are highly variable even within bat lineages and are not useful as morphological correlates of genetic lineages [

]. We thus only compared the maximum width of noseleafs (NLW) amongst the genetic lineages identified in this study. Noseleaf width appears to have some value in characterizing species [

].
</p>
         <p>
Baculum morphology.
Bacula from several vouchers of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
captured in north western 
South Africa
(Vioolsdrif on the Orange River) were removed and photographed for comparison with bacula from museum specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
from central and eastern 
South Africa
(Taung, 
North West Province
and 
Gauteng Province
, respectively) and from 
Swaziland
(also in the eastern part of the sub-continent), as well as with those from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. blasii
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. capensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. clivosus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Preparation of the bacula followed the methods described by Goodman et al. [

]. Baculum images were taken with a Canon 350D camera attached via a LM-Scope Digital SLR Adapter to a Wild stereo microscope. Images were stacked using CombineZP software [

] for increased depth of field. Frames were aligned and balanced using the thorough routine, and stacked using pyramid weighted average.
</p>
         <p>The following nine measurements were taken from each baculum using a microscope with an eyepiece graticule: greatest width of the base viewed in the dorsal plane (WB-d); greatest width of the base viewed in the lateral plane (WB-l); greatest baculum length (GBL); greatest width of the shaft (GW); length from the tip to the point of the greatest shaft width (LTW); narrowest width of the shaft (NW); length from the tip to the point of the narrowest shaft width (LTN); greatest length of the incision on the dorsal side of the base (BIL); and the height of the base, from the midpoint in the dorsal plane of the upper edge of the base to the most extended point at the edge of the base (BH).</p>
         <p>
Statistical analyses of morphometric and echolocation data
</p>
         <p>
Aprincipal component analysis (PCA) on the combined external and skull data from vouchers and museum specimens was done to extract 24 independent and uncorrelated factors from the original set of 24 variables (
Table S1
and Appendix S 
1 in
File S1 Supporting Information; excluding NLW and PF) to meet the assumptions of discriminant function analysis (DFA). DFA was done on the factor scores of principal components with an Eigenvalue ≥ 1 (Kaiser’s criterion; [

]) to examine multivariate morphometric differences within and between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
and other cryptic rhinolophid species (Appendix S 
3 in
File S1 Supporting Information). Prior to PCA, variables were standardized using the z-transformation in Statistica v10 (computed as Std. Score = (raw score – mean)/Std. deviation; [

]). Initial classification of individual bats in DFA followed the taxonomy in Monadjem et al. [

]. In addition, on the basis of evolutionary relationships revealed in our phylogenetic construction, the 
type
localities and geographic ranges of the subspecies [

], we classified all 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
specimens from the more arid western half of the subcontinent (i.e. 
Namibia
, and central, north-western and south-western 
South Africa
) as 

R

<tp:taxon-name>damarensis</tp:taxon-name>

and those from the more mesic eastern half of the subcontinent (i.e.

) as

Amultivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was done on nine measurements of 22 bacula from individuals of the various species included in the DFA (see 
Table S1
and Appendix S 
1 in
FileS1 Supporting Information).
</p>
         <p>
Factorial analysis of variance (factorial ANOVA) was done on the echolocation data (
Table S1
and Appendix S 
1 in
File S1 Supporting Information) with resting frequency as the dependent variable and species (as identified in 
Figures 2
and 
3
) and sex as the categorical predictors. Noseleaf widths were also compared with a similar factorial ANOVA. All morphometric and echolocation analyses were done in Statistica v10 [

Phylogenetic reconstruction

</p>
         <p>In the cyt b sequences 42 % of the 951 cyt b sites were variable and 34% parsimony informative.</p>
         <p>
The topology of the cyt b phylogenetic tree in 
Figure 2
was recovered repeatedly using all three methods of analyses (MP, ML and Bayesian inference). Discrepancies occurred only in the internal topology of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hipposideros
</tp:taxon-name>
spp. outgroup in the ML and MP analyses in which 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. pratti
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. ruber
</tp:taxon-name>
are sister taxa in a clade which is a sister clade to 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. bicolor
</tp:taxon-name>
. Furthermore, the position of the Asian species 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. affinis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. hipposideros
</tp:taxon-name>
was unresolved in both ML and MP analyses but not in the Bayesian analysis. The MP analyses contained several polytomies so that the Asian clade could not be resolved from the African/European clade, the two European species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. euryale
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. mehelyi
</tp:taxon-name>
, were not resolved within the African/European clade and the two African species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. eloquens
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. fumigatus
</tp:taxon-name>
were not resolved within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
damarensis
</tp:taxon-name>
/ 
<tp:taxon-name>
fumigatus
</tp:taxon-name>
clades. However, resolved nodes were generally well supported (high minimum bootstrap values of 70% in ML and 65% in MP analyses and posterior probabilities of 0.80–1.0 for the majority of nodes for the Bayesian inference) throughout the tree and we were able to date the major nodes of interest. The analysis revealed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
(
sensu lato
) is a paraphyletic taxon; eastern and western populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
are placed in two non-sister clades which diverged ~9.68 Mya (Node B, 
Figure 2
; 95% HPD: 5.87– 10.04). The eastern population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
is nested within the classic 
<tp:taxon-name>
fumigatus
</tp:taxon-name>
clade which includes 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. fumigatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. hildebrandtii
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. eloquens
</tp:taxon-name>
. Since the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
is in 
Zimbabwe
we refer to this eastern population as 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
. The second clade comprised individuals sampled in the western regions of 
South Africa
and 
Namibia
. This group of individuals included the 
holotype
of the subspecies 

R

. 

d. 
<tp:taxon-name>damarensis</tp:taxon-name>

(
TM
9474) collected from Oserikari, 
Namibia
. We thus refer to this clade as the 
<tp:taxon-name>
damarensis
</tp:taxon-name>
clade. The 
<tp:taxon-name>
damarensis
</tp:taxon-name>
clade consists of two lineages, northern and southcentral, which diverged ~4.8 Mya (Node A, 
Figure 2
; 95% HPD: 2.69–7.52). The northern lineage is restricted to northern 
Namibia
while the southern lineage includes individuals from central 
Namibia
and north-western, south-western and central 
South Africa
(
Figure 2
)
</p>
         <p>
The THY marker showed substantially less nucleotide variability. From 77 individuals 43 unique sequences were identified with 37% of the sites variable and 18% parsimony informative. All three phylogenetic inference methods failed to resolve clear relationships using the THY data set, even at higher taxonomic levels. The resulting trees had numerous polytomies and low bootstrap values (data not shown). The combined cyt b + THY analysis, using a subset of 13 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals together with 15 additional rhinolophid species for which both markers were available, confirmed the relative topology of the two clades as recovered in the cyt b tree (

1 in
File S1 Supporting Information) had Eigenvalues ≥ 1 and explained 98% of the variance. Classification success was&gt; 80% for all groups. Principal component 1 (associated mainly with size) loaded highest on Root 1 and Principal component 2 (associated with palate length and inter-orbital width) loaded highest on Root 2 (

Several size-related variables, including forearm, skull length, mandible length and length of several digits were good discriminators between the other species (
<tp:taxon-name>
R. clivosus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. capensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>
damarensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
lineages (Root 1, 
Figure 3
); the species with the largest dimensions for these variables (
<tp:taxon-name>
R. clivosus
</tp:taxon-name>
) was placed on the extreme right of Root 1 (
Figure 3
; 
Table S1
and Appendix S

File S1 Supporting Information) and the species with the smallest dimensions (
<tp:taxon-name>
R. blasii
</tp:taxon-name>
) on the extreme left of Root 1 (
Figure 3
; 
Table S1
and Appendix S

<tp:taxon-name>
damarensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
clades. Although 
<tp:taxon-name>
damarensis
</tp:taxon-name>
was slightly bigger (e.g. in forearm and skull length) than 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
, the ranges of their forearms and skull lengths overlapped (
Table S1
and Appendix S

File S1 Supporting Information). Palate length and interorbital width (
Table S1

File S1 Supporting Information) were largely responsible for the separation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. capensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from the other species along Root 2 (

<tp:taxon-name>

Baculum morphology.
The shape and length of the bacula (
Figure 4
) largely supported the clades revealed in the phylogeny (
Figure 2
). The baculum of individuals from the 
<tp:taxon-name>
damarensis
</tp:taxon-name>
clade (
Figure 4a
) had a short, dorso-ventrally flattened basal cone with dorsal and ventral incisions and the sides of the shaft tended to be more convex before tapering to a point (
Figure 4c
). The baculum of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
damarensis
</tp:taxon-name>
specimen from the centre of 
South Africa
(Taung, 
TM
48040; 
Figure 4b
) was similar to those from north western 
South Africa
(Vioolsdrif) but was slightly shorter and the shaft tip appears to be narrower. The cone formed by the base was also more flattened.
</p>
         <p>
There were significant difference in bacula measurements between the species (
Figure 4c
; 
Table S1
and Appendix S 
1 in
File S1 Supporting Information; MANOVA F 
(35.6, 36)
= 8.38, p &lt;0.001) and the bacula of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi

were shorter (mean = 
2.58 mm
) than that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
damarensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(mean = 
3.33 mm
; post-hoc Tukey HSD tests p = 0.01; see Table S6 and Appendix S

0.86 mm
) than that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
damarensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(mean = 
1.29 mm
; p = 0.02; see Table S6 and Appendix S 
1 in

0.33 mm
) than that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
damarensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(mean = 
0.70 mm
; p = 0.006; see Table S6 and Appendix S

Areas with a high probability of occurrence for

and the driest parts of north-western, south-western and central

         <p>
The distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Figure 5a

500mm
(
Figure 6a i

500–1100mm
(
Figure 6a

         <p>
We explored the evolutionary history and ecology of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
(
sensu lato
) in the context of phenotypic convergence across its distributional range in southern Africa. Phylogenetic inference indicates that 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. darlingi
</tp:taxon-name>
is in fact polyphyletic, comprising two non-sister lineages with disjunct distributions in southern Africa (
Figures 1
and

). Despite the genetic divergence between these two lineages echolocation frequencies as well as skull and post-cranial morphology, with the exception of the bacula, are highly convergent.
