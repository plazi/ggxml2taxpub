            Trees grow tall where resources are abundant, stresses are minor, and competition for
            light places a premium on height growth , . The height to which trees can grow and the
            biophysical determinants of maximum height are poorly understood. Some models predict
            heights of up to 120 m in the absence of mechanical damage , , but there are historical
            accounts of taller trees . Current hypotheses of height limitation focus on increasing
            water transport constraints in taller trees and the resulting reductions in leaf
            photosynthesis . We studied redwoods ( Sequoia sempervirens ), including the tallest
            known tree on Earth (112.7 m), in wet temperate forests of northern California. Our
            regression analyses of height gradients in leaf functional characteristics estimate a
            maximum tree height of 122–130 m barring mechanical damage, similar to the tallest
            recorded trees of the past. As trees grow taller, increasing leaf water stress due to
            gravity and path length resistance may ultimately limit leaf expansion and
            photosynthesis for further height growth, even with ample soil moisture. </p>

         <p> According to the cohesion-tension theory, water transport in plants occurs along a
            gradient of negative pressure (tension) in the dead, tube-like cells of the xylem, with
            transpiration, water adhesion to cell walls, and surface tension providing the forces
            necessary to lift water against gravity . Height growth may slow if the xylem tension
            and therefore leaf water potential ( W ) predicted for great heights, &amp;2 2 MPa (ref.
            7), reduces sufficiently the positive pressure (turgor) necessary for expansion of
            living cells or increases the risk of xylem cavitation—cavitation is the formation of
            embolisms that reduce hydraulic conductivity and can cause branch dieback and plant
            death , . Many trees respond to W below 2 1 MPa by decreasing the aperture of
            microscopic pores (stomata) in leaves through which water vapour is lost in
            transpiration and carbon dioxide (CO ) is gained in photosynthesis . Reduced stomatal
            conductance can decrease cavitation risk and turgor loss, but it also limits
            photosynthesis. Thus, as trees grow taller, maintenance of favourable water status might
            progressively slow height growth by reducing photosynthetic carbon gain , . </p>

         <p> We accessed the crowns of redwoods to measure water stress and photosynthesis and to
            collect samples for laboratory analyses. Within individual trees, the xylem pressure of
            small, foliated branches measured during the dry season (late September to early
            October) was strongly correlated with height ( Fig. 1a ). The gradient before dawn, when
            transpiration was negligible, averaged 2 0.0096 ^ 0.0007 MPa m for five trees over 110 m
            tall ( R . 0.97, P , 0.0001), nearly identical to the hydrostatic gradient due to
            gravity (2 0.0098 MPa m ) as predicted by the cohesion-tension theory . The slope of the
            xylem pressure–height relationship was slightly steeper (2 0.0106 ^ 0.0022 MPa m ) at
            midday when the evaporative gradient and transpiration were high. The minimum xylem
            pressure (that is, maximum tension) recorded in the highest branches sampled (108 ^ 1.2
            m) averaged 2 1.84 ^ 0.04 MPa. The importance of height per se for water potential was
            evident in that nearly two-thirds of the midday xylem pressure was due to gravity. </p>

         <p> Reduced water potential due to soil drought causes a decline in the turgor of living
            plant cells that is necessary for cell growth and leaf expansion . To determine if this
            also occurs as water potential declines with height, we estimated turgor at dry-season
            water potentials from pressure–volume measurements. Turgor (in MPa) declined linearly
            with height, h , as turgor ¼ 2 ð 0:0 0 74 ^ 0:0 0 0 4 Þ h þð 1:30 ^ 0:0 7 Þ , n ¼ 4
            trees, ranging from 0.93 MPa at 50 m to 0.48 MPa at 110 m. At night when xylem pressure
            increased, the turgor gradient was less steep, turgor ¼ 2 ð 0:0 0 44 ^ 0:0 0 23 Þ h þð
            1:39 ^ 0:19 Þ , and turgor was 0.3–0.4 MPa higher than at midday. </p>

         <p> Given the role of turgor in leaf expansion, its reduction with height may underlie the
            distinct vertical gradient in leaf structure in redwoods ( Fig. 2 ). Leaf shape varied
            from large and expanded in the lower crown to small and scale-like at the treetop. We
            quantified this variation in terms of the leaf mass:area ratio (LMA, g m ), which
            increased exponentially over a fourfold range with height ( Fig. 1b , LMA ¼ (37.1 ^
            12.3)exp(0.0260 ^ 0.0030) h , 0.88 # R # 0.99, 0.0001 # P # 0.003, n ¼ 5 trees). At 112
            m, LMA was similar to the highest published value for terrestrial plants12.
            Height-related variation in LMA has been attributed to light level in forest canopies ,
            . In our study trees, we found that the direct site factor (DSF), an index of direct
            solar radiation based on hemispherical photographs, decreased by 14% of the value at 110
            m for a 10-m decrease in height. Relative to water potential, the influence of light on
            LMA was small, however; DSF added only 4% to the explained variation of within-crown LMA
            in a multiple regression analysis including DSF ( P ¼ 0.0025) and predawn xylem pressure
            ( P , 0.0001) as independent variables (adjusted R ¼ 0.88, n ¼ 33 samples from five
            redwoods over 110 m tall). The following observations ( Fig. 3 ) also support the
            hypothesis that water relations are more important than light environment in determining
            leaf structure in redwood: (1) leaves of a 2-m-tall epiphytic redwood rooted in soil
            near the top of a 95-m-tall redwood were much more expanded than leaves of the host tree
            in the same light environment, and (2) when a fallen branch from the upper crown of a
            tall redwood was potted in wet soil and allowed to root with the branch exposed to high
            light, the new leaves produced were much more expanded than the existing leaves. It is
            likely that in very tall trees, components of water potential, notably turgor, are
            important determinants of LMA and related anatomical features, just as they are along
            soil moisture gradients12. </p>

         <p> To assess further the physiological consequences of declining water potential with
            height, we measured stable carbon isotope composition ( d C) and leaf photosynthesis.
            The d C value (‰) of plant tissues expresses the photosynthetic discrimination against
            CO compared with 12CO and is a common metric of long-term water stress, ranging from 2
            20‰ to 2 34‰ in plants such as redwood that have the C photosynthetic pathway15. When
            water stress reduces stomatal conductance, CO concentration in the intercellular air
            spaces of leaves (Ci) declines, and this lessens the enzymatic discrimination against CO
            , causing d C to increase. In redwood, foliar d C (‰) was correlated with height ( Fig.
            1c , exponential fits of the form d C þ 31 ¼ b exp( b 0 h ), b ¼ 0:681 ^ 0:434, b 0 ¼
            0.033 ^ 0.005, 0.78 # R # 0.94, 0:0 0 0 1 # P # 0:002). The highest d C was always
            observed at the treetop and averaged 2 22.2 ^ 0.6‰ at $110 m. This is the highest
            published foliar d C for tall trees and is close to the apparent limit for C plants – .
            We also found a significant relationship of d C (‰) to height for the treetop foliage of
            13 trees from 85 m to 110 m tall plus 3 trees taller than 112 m ( Fig. 1c, d C þ 31 ¼
            1.928exp(0.0131 h ), R ¼ 0.321, P ¼ 0.022, n ¼ 16). That d C was higher (less negative)
            at the tops of trees than at the same height within tree crowns probably indicates the
            effect of shading in reducing foliar d C (ref. 15). Nonetheless, patterns both within
            and among trees demonstrate a strong increase of d C with height in redwood, indicative
            of increasing water stress. </p>

         <p> High values of d C occur when stomatal conductance is strongly limiting to
            photosynthesis, as in plants experiencing low water potentials due to soil moisture
            stress15, . Rather than soil moisture stress, however, it is likely that in tall trees
            the reduction in water potential due to gravity and path length resistance causes
            stomatal conductance to increasingly limit photosynthesis with height , . The treetop d
            C of about 2 22‰ corresponds to a flux-weighted Ci of,160 p.p.m. during the assimilation
            of CO into new biomass. This is similar to the average daily Ci estimated from our in
            situ gas exchange measurements near the tops of two 112-m-tall trees during autumn (170
            ^ 11 p.p.m.). Thus, integrated d C and </p>

         <p> Laboratory gas exchange measurements of foliage cut from different heights and
            re-hydrated to uniformly high water potentials enabled us to examine the consequences of
            height for photosyn- thesis in the absence of a direct influence of low water potential.
            Light-saturated photosynthesis per unit leaf area ( P max,a) did not vary with height (
            R ¼ 0.012, P ¼ 0.78), averaging 5.6 m mol CO m s . Photosynthesis per unit leaf mass ( P
            ) max,m decreased with height ( Fig. 1d, P max,m ¼ 2 0.455 h þ 55.3, R ¼ 0.88, P ¼
            0.0002), however, indicating a lower potential photosynthetic return on biomass invested
            in leaves at greater heights. The P max,m of 110-m foliage was 28% of that at 80 m and
            only 16% of that at 50 m. Because light levels decline exponentially with depth in
            forest canopies , actual differences in photosynthesis per unit biomass are probably
            smaller than indicated by our measurements at light saturation. Nonetheless,
            photosynthetic capacity per unit foliar mass declines with height, and we hypoth- esize
            that this results from the observed changes in leaf structure. High LMA is associated
            with high tissue density and increased allocation of biomass to structure, including
            thicker cell walls12, . These changes can increase internal resistance to CO diffusion
            within leaves , , reducing photosynthesis and contributing to high d C values. We
            speculate that the universal influence of gravity on water potential gradients in tall
            trees underlies structural changes in photosynthetic tissues that, along with increased
            stomatal regu- lation, reduce photosynthesis and carbohydrate availability for height
            growth. Our studies of the tallest redwoods reveal gradients in physio- logical and
            structural features that support hypotheses of height limitation due to hydraulic
            constraints , . Water potential, turgor, leaf structure, carbon isotope composition, and
            photosynthesis all change with height as they do along gradients of soil moisture
            stress, consistent with a general role for water availability in determining leaf
            functional traits12, . Height gradients of these variables also allowed us to address
            the potential biophysical limit to height in redwood. To estimate a maximum height in
            the current environ- ment barring mechanical damage, we calculated the height at which
            the functional variables we examined would reach a limit value ( Table 1 ). Low water
            potential affects growth severely when the formation of embolisms by cavitation reduces
            hydraulic conductivity . Whereas it is not uncommon for shorter trees to operate at
            water potentials that cause considerable loss of hydraulic conductivity, cavitation
            avoidance may be critical for height growth in tall trees. Great height may prevent
            recovery of lost hydraulic function by embolism dissolution, the standard model for
            which requires that xylem pressures rise to within a few tenths of 0 MPa (ref. 24),
            higher than is possible in a water column held by tension above a few tens of metres.
            Our measurements of xylem vulnerability to cavitation in upper crown branches (109 m) of
            five trees over 110 m tall indicate that loss of hydraulic conductivity begins as xylem
            pressure drops to 2 1.9 MPa (Supplementary Information), slightly lower than the lowest
            pressure we recorded at the tops of the tallest trees at midday. The xylem
            pressure–height relationship ( Fig. 1a , Table 1 ) estimates a pressure of 2 1.9 MPa at
            122 m, increasing to 132 m for a limit value of 2 2.0 MPa. It is likely that lower water
            potentials and cavitation do occur in tall redwoods, mature individuals of which may
            experience severe droughts during life spans of up to 2,200 years (refs 25, 26). It may
            be during such episodes that the upper crown dies back, as evidenced by our observations
            that nearly all very tall redwoods have multiple tops, the original leader having died
            and been replaced repeatedly. Surveys of several hundred terrestrial plant species
            across diverse biomes report values of LMA from 20 g m for thin planar leaves of
            herbaceous species to a maximum of 833 g m for the scale-like leaves in Juniperus
            monosperma , a short coniferous tree of arid regions and, like redwood, a member of the
            Cupressaceae12, . Using 833 g m as the maximum possible for redwood, the LMA–height
            relationship ( Fig. 1b , Table 1 ) estimates a maximum height of 122 m. If the limiting
            value of LMA is allowed to increase by 10%, the maximum height increases to 126 m. For C
            plants, the apparent limit of foliar d C is the approxi- </p>

         <p> mately 2 20‰ reported for plants of arid environments – . The overall within-crown d
            C–height relationship ( Fig. 1c , Table 1 ) estimates a d C of 2 20‰ at 130 m. The
            sensitivity of this estimate to the limiting d C value is low; heights of 134 m and 125
            m are estimated for d C of 2 19‰ and 2 21‰, respectively. A linear extrapolation of
            maximum photosynthesis versus height ( Fig. 1d , Table 1 ) predicts that P max,m in
            saturating light would decline to 0 at 125 m. Carbon import from elsewhere in the tree
            may support early growth of new leaves, but the trend in foliar d C with height ( Fig.
            1c ) indicates at most a minor quantitative significance of carbon subsidies from the
            lower crown. Taken together, these height trends in ecophysiological variables indicate
            that the maximum height of redwood at our study site in current environmental conditions
            is 122 to 130 m. The reduction in water potential with height reduces leaf expansion and
            photosyn- thesis, the latter directly via increased stomatal regulation, as evidenced by
            d C, and indirectly by altering leaf structure (LMA), which in turn may further
            constrain carbon balance. Several additional lines of evidence support a limit to tree
            height for redwood that is taller than today’s tallest trees and near the estimates from
            our regression analyses. First, our measurements indicate that the tallest redwoods are
            growing by up to 0.25 m yr . Second, over 95% of the original old-growth redwood forest
            has been logged , and it is likely that redwoods taller than today’s giants were felled
            . Third, we analysed the height gradient in foliar d C reported for Douglas-fir ( d C ¼
            0.060 h 2 27.5, R ¼ 0.999, P ¼ 0.005) and estimated by linear extrapolation that d C
            would reach 2 20‰ at 125 m. Finally, the maximum tree height we predict for redwood and
            Douglas-fir is similar to the 126 m of the tallest reliably measured gymnosperm of the
            past, a Douglas-fir . The tallest redwoods today stand in large reserves where intact
            forest structure sustains moist conditions and buffers trees against wind. The trees in
            this study, which include the first, second, fourth, sixth and eighth tallest known
            individuals on Earth, all occur within the largest contiguous old-growth redwood forest
            remaining (Humboldt Redwoods State Park, California), a reserve protecting 89 of the 116
            tallest redwoods. (Measurements of redwoods throughout the species’ range in California
            have found 116 indi- viduals over 107 m; C. Atkins and M. Taylor, personal communi-
            cation.) At reserves further north and closer to the coast, stronger storms may explain
            the lower heights (,100 m), yet similar relationships of water potential and d C to
            height as we observed in the tallest redwoods. At the drier inland margin of redwood’s
            natural distribution in northern California, maximum tree height is lower (,80 m), yet
            treetop values of minimum water potential (2 1.9 MPa) and maximum d C (2 22‰) are
            similar to those at 110 m in the tallest redwoods. Thus a similar physiological ceiling
            may be reached at different physical heights depending on water availability, with storm
            damage reducing realized heights at sites that are otherwise optimal. Tree height should
            also vary over time as climate fluctuates, and linking top dieback dates and growth
            rates to past climate may reinforce our physiological interpretation of height
            limitation. Climate and atmospheric change will affect the height to which redwoods
            grow, the outcome depending on the combined effects of elevated atmospheric CO
            concentration and altered temperature and moisture on tree water relations and carbon
            balance . A </p>

         <p>We accessed tree crowns by shooting arrows trailing filament over branches with a
            powerful bow. Rope was then hauled over the branches and climbed via mechanical
            ascenders. Access to the treetop was achieved by arborist-style techniques. Heights were
            measured by lowering weighted fibreglass measuring tapes from the treetop to average
            ground level.</p>

         <p> Water potential of small branches (#15cm length) located within 1 to 3 m of the main
            trunk was measured using a pressure chamber (PMS Instruments). Measurements of
            photosynthesis used a portable photosynthesis system (LI6400,LiCor) with a 2 cm £ 3 cm
            chamber with red/blue LED light source. Photosynthesis was measured under controlled
            conditions: air temperature, 22 ^ 1 8C; CO concentration, 365 ^ 10 p.p.m.; vapour
            pressure deficit, 1.2 ^ 0.2 kPa; light, $1,400 m mol photons m s ). Samples used for
            laboratory measurements of photosynthesis and pressure–volume relationships were cut
            from different heights, then re-cut immediately under water, allowed to re-hydrate
            overnight, and then measured. This produced high water potentials (2 0.6 ^ 0.3 MPa) and
            allowed comparisons of photosynthetic capacity without the influence of height- related
            variation in water potential. During these measurements, the Ci values did not differ
            significantly in foliage from different heights (239 ^ 16 p.p.m., P ¼ 0.42). Turgor was
            estimated by the pressure–volume method . </p>

         <p> To determine LMA,projected surface areas of 10 second-year internodes from each sample
            height were measured using a digital surface-area meter (Delta T Instruments). Samples
            were oven-dried at 70 8C, weighed, and mean LMA calculated as g m . Area and mass
            measurements included the entire foliated internode. </p>

         <p> d C of foliage samples was analysed at the Colorado Plateau Stable Isotope Laboratory
            (http://www4.nau.edu/cpsil/). In 2000, second-year internodes were collected at
            different heights, dried (70 8C), ground to 40 mesh, and then a subsample was
            pulverized, encapsulated in tin, and combusted (CE Instruments NC2100) at 1,000 8C. The
            resultant CO was purified and its CO /12CO ratio was analysed by isotope-ratio mass
            spectrometry (Delta Plus XL, ThermoQuest Finnigan) in continuous-flow mode. The d C
            values were expressed as the relative abundance of C versus 12C compared with a standard
            (Pee Dee Belemnite): d C ¼ ( R / R 2 1)1,000‰, where R and R are sam std sam std the
            C/12C ratios in sample and standard,respectively.The standard deviation of repeated
            measurements of secondary standard material was,0.1‰ (external precision). </p>
