SM1: Introductory details to the descriptions of 10 new bird taxa

</p>
         <p>Frank E. Rheindt, Dewi M. Prawiradilaga, Hidayat Ashari, Suparno, Chyi Yin Gwee, Geraldine W. X. Lee, Meng Yue Wu, Nathaniel S. R. Ng</p>
         <p>
The following supplementary sections (SM2 – SM11) provide the scientific descriptions of 10 new bird taxa. We adopt a baseline taxonomy following Eaton et al. (

). ZooBank Life Science Identifiers (LSID) are given for each newly described taxon to comply with Article 8.5.3 of the Code of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (
6 5
). The LSID for this publication is: urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:8114B399-C68D-43C2-B6D3- B51AA898431E.
</p>
         <p>The supplementary section for each of the 10 new taxa (SM2 to SM11) is made up of the following eight to nine sub-sections: The first sub-section provides detailed information regarding the holotype, including collection, sampling and storage details, biometric measurements and observations regarding the condition of the bird at the time of collection. Abbreviation used: MZB – Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense, Cibinong, West Java, Indonesia.</p>
         <p>
The second sub-section (“description of holotype”) is an in-depth characterization of the plumage and bare parts coloration of each of the ten holotype specimens. Color descriptions follow a widely used color chart system (

).
</p>
         <p>The third sub-section contains the “diagnosis”. Diagnoses are an integral component of any zoological taxon description and provide information on how the new taxon differs</p>
         <p>from closely related taxa. All comparative museum specimen material inspected for the purposes of taxon description and diagnosis are listed in table S2.</p>
         <p>The fourth sub-section titled “etymology” provides a rationale for our naming choices. We additionally provide grammatical information to ensure taxonomists know whether each name is declinable or inalienable in the case of future genus shifts.</p>
         <p>The fifth sub-section provides a brief statement on “individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon”, i.e., intra-taxonic variation. In some of our descriptions, variation within a newly described taxon is poorly known or seemingly absent, but in other cases, our specimen material allows for a more substantive characterization.</p>
         <p>The sixth sub-section is on the “history of discovery” of each taxon, describing how exactly it first came to the attention of ornithological science. While some of these taxa had not been known to modern ornithologists before our own field efforts, others had previously been seen and reported on, but without an effort to collect material for a formal description.</p>
         <p>The seventh sub-section delivers information on “distribution and status”, including details about the possibility of finding some of these taxa on small neighboring islands, and more in-depth assessments of their ecological requirements and conservation status.</p>
         <p>The eighth – often most voluminous – sub-section contains detailed information on the “taxonomic rationale” for assigning species or subspecies rank to each of the taxa. Going far beyond the plumage and biometric information given in the holotype sub-sections, this part provides in-depth details on bioacoustic and/or genetic analyses. The exact content and scope of this section differs considerably among taxa:</p>
         <p>
(1) Genetic information is provided for each of the five new species descriptions (SM2 to SM6) and compared to closely-related species to shed light on their taxonomic status. In the case of the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura
</tp:taxon-name>
fantail (SM2), taxonomic rationale is based on our previously published genomic comparisons within the
</p>
         <p>
genus (
7 2
). In the case of the two new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf warblers (SM5 to SM6), we present a novel genetic dataset containing thousands of genome-wide loci in addition to DNA sequence data from a mitochondrial coding gene. In the case of the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
grasshopper-warbler (SM3), we bring entire novel mitochondrial genomes to bear on its taxonomic status. Finally, in the case of the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeater (SM4), comparisons of DNA sequence data from a mitochondrial coding gene are presented.
</p>
         <p>
(2) In-depth bioacoustic analyses are provided for four of the five new species descriptions (SM2–SM3, SM5–SM6). Only in the case of the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeater (SM4) did we dispense with the analysis of bioacoustic data because members of this genus utter complex repertoires of poorly characterized song and call notes that have previously been associated with pronounced analytical complications (

).
</p>
         <p>
(3) In the case of the five new subspecies to science (SM7 to SM11), our sub-sections on taxonomic rationale are briefer, given that subspecies designation is the conservative option requiring less in-depth justification. However, we do present extensive genetic information, including thousands of genome wide loci and mitochondrial sequences, to investigate the level of differentiation of the two new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoiler subspecies (SM7 to SM8). Also, for the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
jungle-flycatcher (SM9), we make reference to a bioacoustic and mitochondrial dataset we recently published elsewhere (

). This leaves only two of our new subspecies descriptions, the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ficedula
</tp:taxon-name>
flycatcher (SM11) and the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Turdus
</tp:taxon-name>
thrush (SM10), entirely based on the morphological evidence we collected.
</p>
         <p>A final – ninth – sub-section was added to SM3–SM4, SM6 and SM8 to outline the methodology applied in bioacoustic and/or genetic analyses. Such a separate methodological</p>
         <p>
sub-section is only given where needed, i.e. in cases involving extensive analyses requiring the communication of substantial detail. This sub-section is shared in the two cases involving the description of pairs of congeneric taxa (i.e., the two new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers SM5–SM6 and the two new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers SM7 – SM8).

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Crown, nape, ear coverts and neck sides are mid-brown (7.5YR 4/2), with a distinct cinnamon-chestnut forehead extending over eye (7.5YR 4/8). Black rictal bristles. Nape color slowly grading into warmer cinnamon-rufous (2.5YR 4/10) across mantle, scapulars and rump to the basal 60% portion of tail. The outer remiges are mostly dark dusky-brown (7.5YR 2/1), becoming paler and more olive-brown (7.5YR 4/2) towards the inner remiges. All remiges have narrow but intense rufous outer edging concolorous with rump and lower back color. The wing coverts are almost identical to the inner remiges in color, with an increasing intensity and width of bright-rufous feather tipping towards the median and lesser coverts. The distal 40% of the tail is greyish-black (N2), with paler rufous tips (5YR 5/6) on the underside only. Chin and throat form a white triangle delimited below by a conspicuous large black breast patch. A diffuse band of grey coloration (N5) with a black scaly appearance created by black feathers with narrow grey edging demarcates the black breast patch on its lower side. The belly is pale buff (7.5YR 9/8), grading into a richer, fuller hue on the flanks and undertail coverts (7.5YR 5/6). The iris is dark-brown, the bill black with a pinkish base to the lower mandible, and the tarsus on the live bird was described as pinkish- horn.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A mid-sized, rufous-toned 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura
</tp:taxon-name>
typical of a radiation of fantails distributed throughout Australasia. It most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
(

57

), and constitutes the third member of this radiation. Its plumage distinctions from the other two species are subtle yet consistent. However, the most characteristic distinction is its unique courtship vocalization (
7 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, the new species differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Sula Islands in its much narrower, less distinct rufous tips to the underside of the rectrices, in its more distinct black scaling below the black breast patch, and in its more strongly cinnamon-buff (less white) central underparts. The new species’ throat is cleaner white, less interspersed with dusky tips to the feathers.
</p>
            <p>
The new species differs from all three subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi in its wider black portion of the tail and its warmer brown crown and upper mantle. When compared to the geographically most closely adjacent subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni toradja
</tp:taxon-name>
from eastern and central Sulawesi, the new species additionally differs in its cleaner white throat and slightly less conspicuous scaling below the black breast patch, while it is additionally distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
of the Lompobattang Massif in South Sulawesi by its blacker breast patch and by the richer chestnut (less cinnamon) coloration of its brighter body parts (such as supercilium, rear upperparts, flanks and vent).

Etymology

</p>
            <p>The new species’ epithet is in honor of the late Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie (deceased 11 Sep 2019), the third president of the Republic of Indonesia. President Habibie was known as a keen environmentalist and contributed greatly to the science and conservation of nature in Indonesia.</p>

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The only three specimens (all adult; one female, two males) exhibit limited variation in terms of extent of breast patch and black mottling below breast patch that may have been caused by the preparation of the specimens.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new species has doubtless been known to the local inhabitants of Peleng Island for a long time. Mochamad Indrawan was presumably the first outside ornithologist to see this new bird when encountering a dead individual during his work on Peleng in the mid-2000s and re- encountering the species in the wild on several undated occasions (

49

). During a field trip between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently observed the species near the type locality (

49

), where we returned from 18-23 Dec 2013 to collect the type and the accompanying individuals (

19

).

            <p>
Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new species is restricted to montane forest on the island of Peleng, the largest landmass in the Banggai Archipelago, at elevations not lower than 750m (

19
, 
49

) (

). Over two longer visits to the highlands of Peleng, we found that the species becomes gradually more common towards higher elevations before it seems to drop out somewhere slightly below the tallest peak on Peleng at 1,022m. The new species is replaced on Sulawesi to the west by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
, and on the Sula Archipelago to the east by 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Its occurrence on other islands of the Banggai Archipelago is highly unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
must be considered threatened given the small extent of its occurrence and the continuing loss of its habitat. Only 25,071 ha of land on Peleng fall above the approximate 750m elevational cutoff, most of it formerly constituting a single contiguous block of highland forest (

). However, our own observations in combination with satellite imagery indicate extensive forest loss to small-scale agriculture and logging by burgeoning village communities. Google Earth’s present coverage of the area is mixed, with large swathes covered by insufficient or outdated (e.g., 2004) imagery. However, given current satellite coverage, a conservative estimate is that 9,987 ha (~40%) from within the elevational range of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
have either been completely deforested or constitute young regrowth or unviable forest fragments surrounded by clearings. This would leave only 15,084 ha of more or less undisturbed primary or older secondary forest. Recent observations indicate, however, that this extent of forest loss is probably an underestimate. After the first discovery of this species and a number of other new bird taxa on Peleng (

49

), the island became a destination for an average of 1-3 international adventure and birdwatching tour groups per year, which considerably helped spur the local economy of the village near the type locality (name withheld). While this sort of ecotourism has a positive impact on the natural environment in many reported cases, on Peleng the sudden influx of tourist dollars led to observations of increased logging and expansion of infrastructure, prompting the rapid destruction of forest at the original type locality over the last five years. In the near future, it will be of paramount importance for the survival of Peleng’s unique montane fauna to find ways in which the influx of eco-tourism dollars can create incentives for conservation.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
Based on its plumage coloration, the new species is clearly a member of the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, hitherto known from Sulawesi and the Sula Archipelago (

57

). The discovery of a new constituent of this radiation on the Banggai Archipelago closes the geographic gap between Sulawesi and Sula. Most previous taxonomic treatises (e.g. 
6 1, 7 5
) have regarded all members of this radiation as conspecific, and indeed plumage differences are relatively minor and have long been interpreted as consistent with a subspecific treatment. However, recent research into patterns of bioacoustic and genomic differentiation among rusty-bellied fantails from Sulawesi, Sula and Banggai has produced strong evidence in favor of species level treatment of all three island populations (
7 2
).

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="biology_ecology">
            <p>
Vocalizations
: Bioacoustically, the courtship vocalization (=song) of the new species from Peleng is the most distinct of any member of the radiation. A detailed characterization of this song has been published elsewhere (

49

). In fact, when we first found the species in the field, the bird stood out through its unusual, simple descending song that lacks the typical complex tinkling quality of its congeners (

49

). Quantitative bioacoustic comparisons revealed that the unusual vocal features of the new Peleng species have led to an acoustic leapfrog pattern in rusty-bellied fantails in which the two terminal (=easternmost and westernmost) species (i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) are more similar to each other in courtship vocalizations but are geographically divided by the new species with its unusual song (
7 2
). The great vocal distinctness of the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
is surprising because it belies its geographic proximity to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
(Sulawesi)
</tp:taxon-name>
across a combined lowland and sea gap of less than 40km and its frequent land connection to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
(Taliabu)
</tp:taxon-name>
across Pleistocene land bridges during times of global cooling (

49

). Vocal behavior is known to be an important feature in species cohesion and reproductive isolation in songbirds (
7 6, 77
), and has been shown to be more important as an indicator of species limits than plumage traits in some passerine lineages (

78

). Therefore, recent authors have accepted the unmistakable vocal uniqueness of the new Peleng fantail as an indication of its status as an undescribed new species (
57, 7 2
).

Genomic data
: In a previously published analysis (
7 2
), we conducted a comparison of&gt;11,000 genome-wide markers with a complete representation among 16 individuals spanning all three species within the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. In this analysis, the new species from Peleng emerged as most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (both subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
toradja
) and less closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sula. This phylogenomic result is significant considering that – among all pairwise vocal comparisons – the greatest bioacoustic differentiation is found between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and the new species, with strong vocal distinctions in both non-courtship vocalizations and courtship songs (
7 2
). Therefore, the relatively shallowest genomic differentiation among the three island populations corresponds to the deepest bioacoustic divergence.
</p>
            <p>
Although the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
emerged as most closely related within the radiation, comparisons of genome-wide data allow for the designation of both taxa as independent species: the basal split between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other taxa is mainly based on a genomic signal contained in ~20% of the genetic variance across study loci, whereas the second most dominant genomic signature – contained in ~14% of the genetic variance across markers – predominantly represents the deep divergence between the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
[

in (
7 2
)]. The presence of a significant proportion of genomic locus cohorts displaying deep differentiation between the new species and either of its two neighbors was in agreement with gene flow analyses (‘ABBA-BABA tests’) that pointed to a history of rare introgression between the new species and its neighbors (
7 2
), perhaps during episodes of unusual climate forcing dispersal between islands. Such secondary introgression is not unusual among congeneric bird species (

79

) and is not in conflict with species level treatment.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>
The entire crown from forehead to nape is rich earthen-brown (7.5YR 3/3) with slightly darker feather margins creating a scalloped appearance. A thin off-white supercilium is pronounced from bill base to just behind eye, from where it slowly tapers out. Lores are dark brownish-black (2.5Y 1.5/1). Ear coverts are of a medium earthen-brown tone (5YR 3/1) with fine pale shaft streaks giving a grizzled appearance, grading into a more greyish-brown tone (10YR 6/1) in the moustachial and malar region. The mantle and scapulars down to the uppertail coverts are largely concolorous with the crown but lack the scalloping created by darker feather margins. The remiges are mostly a rich cold dark-brown (2.5YR 2/1) but have warmer outer webs concolorous with mantle. The upperwing coverts are similarly two-toned, being mostly concolorous with mantle but some showing darker outer webs concolorous with most of remiges. As typical for the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
, the rectrices are narrow and dark- brown, very close in color to the remiges (2.5YR 2/1). The tail feathers are mostly worn, although one in the centre appears to be a new replacement.
</p>
            <p>The white chin and throat are quite sharply demarcated from the face. The lower throat and upper breast, still white, are interspersed with fine dusky speckling increasing towards the breast and lower throat sides where the color grades into a solid mid-grey (N5) with only few inconspicuous dusky speckles. The grey breast color then grades into a tawny- ochraceous belly color (7.5YR 4/6), first through tracts of grey feathers which have warm- ochraceous edging, then through tracts of largely ochraceous feathers that still have a grey feather centre, eventually to all-ochraceous feathers. The belly color becomes darker and richer on the undertail coverts and flanks (7.5YR 3/4).</p>
            <p>The bill is black with an inconspicuous paler tip. The gape on the live bird was slightly enlarged light yellow. The iris is dark brown. The tarsus and toes were described on the live bird as maroon-horn with paler, more yellowish toepads.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A rich dark-brown forest warbler typical of the montane resident 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. As is usual across this cryptic genus, the new taxon is most conspicuous not on the basis of its plumage but its vocalizations.
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, it is most similar in size and shape to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
of Sulawesi. However, in comparison to the new taxon, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
has less distinct speckling on the breast, has a more uniform crown that is less scalloped, paler and warmer brown upperparts, greyer underparts with brown mostly only on flanks, and has a less pointed, wider tail.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram differs in its less distinct central breast spotting, greyer (less whitish) supercilium, and more extensive grey on breast reaching further onto upper breast, neck sides and auriculars.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru differs in its much whiter breast, with off-white reaching onto mid-belly, whereas only the lower flanks and lower belly are warm-brown. Although the central breast of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
has a mid-grey tinge, its underparts are much paler than the new species’ fairly uniform grey lower breast, which grades into a fairly dark homogeneous warm-brown belly.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is quite different from the smaller 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. montis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Java. The latter is much paler cinnamon-brown on upperparts, crown and especially remiges and rectrices, and is uniformly buff-white below with extensive dark-brown speckling from chin to upper belly, lacking the new species’ grey tones on the breast and dark warm-brown tones on the belly.

            <p>
The name 
<tp:taxon-name>
portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
– past participle of Latin ‘portendere’ – roughly translates as “the predicted one” or “the foretold one” and relates to the unusual circumstances of discovery when FER first heard the new warbler and recognized it to be a novel species of

multiple days before a visual confirmation was obtained.

            <p>Currently only one adult specimen is available (i.e., the holotype), and photos of up to two more adults suggest that this is probably a sexually monomorphic species with limited plumage variation.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
FER was the first person to discover 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on 9 April 2009 near its type locality when he heard an unmistakable insect-like sound that he attributed to a hitherto unnamed taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
grasshopper-warbler. Having been exposed to the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on a visit to Sulawesi only two weeks prior, and having had previous field experience with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru and Seram, respectively (
8 0
), FER was aware that the song of this population – albeit superficially reminiscent of the others – is distinct at the species level. Even so, because of the retiring nature of this bird and ill-timed heavy rain, it took FER another two hiking expeditions to the highlands of Taliabu to finally confirm on 15 April 2009 that this song was indeed uttered by what he perceived as an “unusually dark” individual of grasshopper-warbler (

48

). We encountered this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected a single specimen, now the holotype.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is presumably restricted to montane forest at the highest elevations of the island of Taliabu (

19
, 
48

) (

). All our records are from elevations above 1,050m on the more mountainous western half of the island of Taliabu, which reaches its highest altitude of ~1,415m at an unnamed peak near our collection locality (

). The new species inhabits a peculiar type of dwarf montane forest typical of these elevations.
</p>
            <p>
The occurrence of the new species on neighboring islands is highly doubtful. Of the three major islands that form the Sula archipelago, Taliabu is the largest and tallest. The smallest main island, Sanana, barely reaches above 600m elevation. The highest elevation on its larger neighbor Mangole is 1,127m – theoretically within the elevational range of this grasshopper-warbler – but the area of land above 1,050m on Mangole is only ~36 ha, which is too small an area to allow for the survival of a highly montane bird species throughout evolutionary time scales. On the neighboring Banggai archipelago, the situation is similar: the only island high enough to allow for the theoretical possibility of grasshopper-warbler breeding occurrence is Peleng (highest elevation ~1,022m), but extensive fieldwork around this highest area has not revealed the presence of any resident grasshopper-warblers (

19
, 
49

).
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
must be a rare bird: Taliabu’s area above 1,050m amounts to ~16,690 ha of formerly forested land in the interior of the island’s western half, over 97% of which forms one contiguous block (

). However, satellite imagery predominantly from 2004 indicates that a total of ~1,023 ha (~6.1%) of this area had been affected by logging operations that have degraded the forest and removed its undercover, presumably rendering the affected areas unsuitable, or nearly so, for the grasshopper-warbler. In the one-and-a-half decades since the satellite images were obtained, extensive additional logging is likely to have occurred. Another 940 ha (~5.6%) of the area above 1,050m have succumbed to a series of catastrophic forest fires in 1982 and 1983, and now constitute open grassland habitat unsuitable for this warbler (

). Our surveys showed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
does not occur in the extensive recently generated grasslands in the highlands of Taliabu (

48

). This leaves 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
with less than 15,000 ha of suitable habitat, an area likely to further diminish in size with ongoing habitat destruction and the impacts of global warming leading to an upward elevational shift of habitat zones.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We include this new taxon within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
following the phylogenetic demonstration that the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bradypterus
</tp:taxon-name>
(previously used for this Southeast Asian clade of warblers) is restricted to Africa (
8 1, 8 2
). Its inclusion within 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
is the reason why we follow the recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] of using the English moniker ‘grasshopper-warbler’ rather than the term ‘bush-warbler’, which is more appropriately reserved for members of a radiation in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Cettiidae</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
is renowned for its cryptic and conservative coloration that has confounded plumage-based classifications for decades and led to delays in the recognition of species-level taxa until bioacoustic and molecular methods have been applied (
8 3, 8 4
). In Wallacea, members of a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from Sulawesi and the Moluccas were previously united into a single polytypic species 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
(
6 1, 7 5
), but have recently been divided into three constituent island species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru, on the basis of their strikingly different songs (

57

). Our new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is geographically surrounded by constituents of this radiation and is a member of it both on the basis of morphological characters (see Diagnosis) and bioacoustic ones.
</p>
            <p>
Although plumage distinctions are not as important in the genus, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by comparatively unique, dark-brown upperparts that stand in contrast to the generally paler and warmer-brown upperparts of neighboring species. However, we mainly attribute species status to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on the basis of its unique song and genetic differentiation. We here provide an excerpt of ongoing analyses as relating to the bioacoustic and mitogenomic differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>

from neighboring species.

Bioacoustic evidence
: A total of 41 suitable, high-quality, homologous 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
song recordings from the field were gathered for analysis from various sources, encompassing all three previous species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation plus the new species. These recordings were measured for 11 suitable bioacoustic parameters, and resultant measurements were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and a conservative vocal diagnosability criterion (

85

), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Further details regarding all analyzed recordings, such as GPS locations, dates, times, and names of recordists, are listed in table S3, while more details on bioacoustic methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
Based on the Isler Criterion, eight out of eleven song parameters measured were diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and two other taxa: 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (table S4). Four out of eleven parameters were Isler-diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (table S4). The ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) can be adopted to ascertain if the level of vocal divergence between these archipelagic taxa is comparable in magnitude to divergences across unequivocal species-level divisions. When comparing Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler song against that of the Friendly Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
, a geographically distant species from montane Borneo that has never been included in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, only two parameters emerged as Isler-diagnosable (table S4). Using this result as a yardstick for what constitutes species level vocal differentiation, the magnitude of vocal divergence between Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
on Seram, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
on Buru, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on Sulawesi is extremely high, indicating they all have diagnosably distinct vocalizations that are best reflected in species rank.
</p>
            <p>
Principal component analysis of the vocal measurements underscores the vocal distinctness of Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from the other three Wallacean species (

). A cumulative proportion of variance of 73.3% is accounted for in the first two principal components, suggesting a strong vocal differentiation between Taliabu and the remaining taxa (

).
</p>
            <p>
Mitogenomic evidence
: Using whole-genome sequencing and laboratory approaches for the use of ancient DNA, we created an alignment of whole-mitochondrial sequences spanning ~15,000 base pairs (bp) across 11 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals belonging to all four constituent island forms of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, and used three different phylogenetic tree-building methodologies to investigate relationships and levels of divergence. More details on the methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
All three phylogenetic trees produced indicated identical topologies with high bootstrap support (

), suggesting that the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is an independent lineage most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (mitogenomic divergence ~2%), and much more distantly related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (divergence ~4.8–5%) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (divergence ~7.7–8%). Mitogenomic divergences roughly correlate with those from the COI barcoding gene, although they do not have to be equal in magnitude.
</p>
            <p>
Integrating the vocal and mitogenomic evidence, it is clear that bioacoustic differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, the two species which emerged most closely related on the mitogenomic tree (

), far exceed those between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and a geographically distant species (
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
) that has never been closely associated with the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. Our combined evidence therefore supports the treatment of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
as a well-diverged small-insular endemic species.

Bioacoustic sampling:
We obtained 41 homologous recordings, which were either recorded by us in the field, or privately sourced from avid field ornithologists (including Robert O. Hutchinson and Ross Gallardy), or collected from publicly accessible online databases, namely the Avian Vocalization Center (AVoCet at http://avocet. integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu), the Xeno-Canto Sound Library (www.xeno-canto.org), the Macaulay Sound Library (www.macaulaylibrary.org), and the Internet Bird Collection (www.hbw.com/ibc).
</p>
            <p>Although slight variation in recording quality exists in the equipment used, inspection and comparison of spectrograms from different devices showed that this variation is comparable to that amongst recordings made by one sole recordist using the same device. In addition, although there is some variability in background noise, spectrogram inspection suggested that measurements of vocalizations would not be affected. Measurements of the recordings were performed using the program Raven Pro Version 1.5 (Bioacoustics Research Program, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA) on its default settings. The following eleven parameters were chosen for bioacoustic analysis, with each parameter averaged over all the measurements across one recording:</p>
            <p>1. Total number of elements per motif (with an element being a syllable represented by a trace on the spectrogram, and a motif being a collection of elements always repeated together)</p>
            <p>2. Number of introductory elements per motif (with introductory elements being brief, truncated, and usually fainter elements preceding the main body of the song)</p>
            <p>
3. Number of main elements per motif (with main elements taking up the bulk of the song, in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
typically in the form of shrill, insect-like trills)
</p>
            <p>4. Total duration of a motif</p>
            <p>5. Total duration of introductory elements</p>
            <p>6. Total duration of main elements</p>
            <p>7. Duration of break between introductory and main elements</p>
            <p>8. Minimum frequency of a motif</p>
            <p>9. Maximum frequency of a motif</p>
            <p>10. Bandwidth (i.e., maximum minus minimum frequency)</p>
            <p>11. Peak frequency of a motif (i.e., the frequency at which the amplitude of the sound is</p>
            <p>highest)</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic analysis:
The vocal diagnosability criterion outlined by Isler et al. (
8 5
), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, was used to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Besides other oscine passerines (
73, 8 6
), this criterion has been employed as a bioacoustic species delimitation method across Asian birds such as owls (

58
, 
87

), pigeons (

50
, 
52
, 
88

), and nightjars (

89

). The Isler criterion has two parts which must be fulfilled in order to infer diagnosability. Firstly, the range of measurements of a parameter between two taxa must not exhibit overlap, and secondly, the data have to satisfy the following equation: 
xa
+ 
taSDa ≤xb–tbSDb,
where (
x
) refers to the respective means of measurements in taxon a and b, and 
ti
refers to the t-score at the 95th percentile of the t distribution for 
n-1
degrees of freedom. This is a stricter statistical test than the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (
8 5
) as it employs the standard deviation of the sample points instead of the taxon mean, allowing for the diagnosis of distinctions between taxa under more rigorous conditions. Successful Isler diagnosability is defined here as the presence of at least one vocally diagnostic parameter between taxa.

DNA extraction methods:
Fresh tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
was DNA- sequenced along with the following number of toepad scrapings of historical museum specimens: three of the Buru Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, three of the Seram Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and four of the Sulawesi Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
. All museum samples had been kindly contributed by the American Museum of Natural History (for voucher numbers, see 

and table S5). DNA extraction was carried out with the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extraction of the historic museum specimens’ toepad scrapings was conducted by trained personnel (CYG) in a room dedicated to ancient DNA extraction to preclude DNA contamination. The toepads were rinsed with water four times before extraction to ensure preservatives were removed, and DTT was added to facilitate digestion of keratin present in toepads. The concentrations of the DNA extracts were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay.
</p>
            <p>
DNA sequencing methods:
The holotype’s DNA extract was sheared into smaller fragments of ~250 base pairs (bp) using 13 cycles of 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off on a Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode, USA). Whole-genome library preparation for the holotype was carried out using a NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, USA) for Illumina according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the museum toepad extracts, the shearing step was omitted as the ancient DNA is already degraded and NEBNext FFPE DNA repair mix (New England Biolabs, USA) was added to each ancient DNA sample prior to library preparation to fix damage common to degraded DNA such as deamination, nicks and gaps. In addition, size selection of library preparation products was omitted for the toepad samples to reduce DNA loss from bead selection. A total of five PCR cycles were run on the holotype’s DNA extract and 12 PCR cycles on the toepads’ extracts. Whole-genome library preparation of toepad samples was carried out in a room with a PCR hood dedicated to ancient library preparation work. The concentrations and peak fragment sizes of the libraries were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay and an Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer (Agilent, USA), respectively. The peak fragment sizes of the historic museum samples and the fresh holotype (including adaptors and unique indexes) were ~230bp and ~380bp, respectively. All prepared libraries were sent to NovogeneAIT Genomics Singapore for Illumina sequencing using a HiSeq 4000 platform to produce 150bp paired-end reads.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial genome alignment
: Trimmomatic (version 0.33) (

90

) was used to remove adaptors and filter low quality reads (below 15 Phred quality score). We applied the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (version 0.7.15-r1140) (
9 1
) to align reads to a mitochondrial reference genome, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella pryeri
</tp:taxon-name>
(Genbank accession no.: NC_029151), with a minimum mapping quality score of 30. Samtools (version 1.9) (
9 2, 9 3
) was run to convert the SAM output files from the alignment to a BAM format for downstream analysis. Then Picard (version 2.18.21; http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) was employed to insert read groups and remove PCR duplicate artifacts. The BAM files were then imported into CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0.4 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com) for remapping to the same reference genome using the following mapping parameters: mismatch penalty of 1, insertion penalty of 1, and deletion penalty of 1. The reads were locally realigned at indel regions, and the consensus sequences were extracted at a minimum coverage threshold of 100. A mapping summary produced by Qualimap (version 2.2.1) (
9 4
) indicated that our mitochondrial genome coverage ranged between ~290–2920x for museum samples and ~6430x for the holotype (table S5). Sequences are deposited with GenBank at accession numbers 
MN597052
- 
MN597062
.
</p>
            <p>
Phylogenetic analysis
: The consensus sequences were exported in FASTA format and visually realigned in MEGA7 (

95

), producing a final whole-mitochondrial alignment of ~15,000bp. MEGA7 was used to construct a neighbor-joining tree based on uncorrected p- divergences and a maximum parsimony tree. Additionally, we ran raxmlGUI 1.5 beta (

96

) to construct a maximum likelihood tree using the GTRGAMMA model as specified by jModelTest (version 2.1.7) (

97

). All tree-building analyses were conducted with 10,000 bootstrap replicates. Pairwise uncorrected p-divergences across the mitogenomic alignment were calculated in MEGA7 with 10,000 bootstrap replicates.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Head and mantle down to uppertail coverts and to central belly are bright scarlet-red (7.5R 4/14) with subtle blackish suffusion owing to individual feathers having broad red distal half followed by black and then increasingly greyish basal half; jet-black narrow orbital ring and loral line. Upperwings, sides of mantle, scapulars and rectrices are matt black, with the remiges appearing slightly duskier black because of narrow olive edging to outer webs; underwing coverts and outer webs of the underside of remiges are whitish; a blackish-grey (N1.5) wedge extends from vent up to central belly.

The diagnosis refers to the adult male plumage only. Female 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals of the Wallacean radiation are generally very similar across species, and more research is needed to identify good distinguishing marks.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is an obvious, bright scarlet-and-black representative of the Wallacean grouping of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters that have often been united within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
complex (
6 1, 7 5
), but have been considered a radiation of independent species by more recent authors [e.g. (

57

)]. Within this radiation, the new species most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species has a more extensive and brighter red body and blacker wings, scapulars, and tail. Scarlet feathers in the new species are mostly black and grey at the base, with only the distal half scarlet, and with a sharp contrast between scarlet and black, lacking 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
’s narrow yellow bands in between the red and black portions of each individual feather that render the latter’s overall body more orange-tinted. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the red is not as extensive on the underparts, and the abdomen and vent are paler buff-white versus blackish-grey in the new species.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species is paler and greyer (not black) on vent and abdomen. It also has a smudgier scarlet body coloration (caused by the black and grey basal halves of individual feathers), with dark smudges especially pronounced on face and on breast sides, as compared to more uniform red underparts, head and mantle in 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
. Black lores in the new species are wider and not as clearly delimited as in 
<tp:taxon-name>

.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis

Etymology

</p>
            <p>We name this species after the village of Wahe (1.716°S, 124.843°E), which is the gateway to the highest elevations on Taliabu where it most commonly occurs. The species epithet is an indeclinable noun in apposition.</p>

Individual, age-related and sexual variation within taxon

</p>
            <p>
Two adult male specimens (holotype and 34.356) are virtually identical in coloration. Two additional male specimens (34.373 and 34.403), most likely immatures, are similar but have the scarlet body color replaced with a more rose-red hue (5R 4/14); they also do not exhibit any distinct olive margins of remiges. No comparative specimen material exists for adult females of the new species, which are generally similar among all regional 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species. Photos confirm that the female of the new species resembles other regional species (data not shown). One juvenile specimen (34.407) lacks red coloration and is generally drab grayish-brown (paler on underparts), becoming more intense earthen-brown on the mantle, rump and upperwing coverts, with the underside of remiges and rectrices mid-grey.

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
was first spotted by a University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 led by P.J. Davidson. Participants of this exploratory survey were probably the first ornithologists to visit the highlands of Taliabu between 600-800 m elevation (
64, 9 8
), where they found the new species predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m). FER then encountered the species commonly during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu between 4-18 April 2009 (

19
, 
48

), where we returned between 6-16 December 2013 to collect the holotype and accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has thus far only been found on the island of Taliabu within the Sula Archipelago. On Taliabu, we have recorded it from sea level to 1,300m (

19
, 
48

), and it presumably occurs further up all the way to the highest elevation at ~1,415m. The species inhabits forest canopy and edge habitat, and is a nectarivore and frugivore that has been photographed feeding at flowers (

48

). Akin to multiple other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species in Wallacea (

57

), the new species is seen far more often at higher elevations (roughly above ~800m) than in the lowlands. Davidson et al. (

64

), who first sighted this species, exclusively found it at higher elevations, mostly around ~800m, and we recorded it as “abundant” above 800m, whereas we have only had a handful of sightings in the lowlands. It is unknown to what extent elevational differences in abundance reflect the difficulty of detecting a canopy bird in tall lowland forest as compared to stunted montane forest. However, although detection difficulties may help mask its true abundance in the lowlands, we do not believe it is possible for the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
to be equally common across elevations given that other small canopy birds do not escape detection in the lowlands and are recorded commonly. In fact, the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
may even be a breeding endemic to montane elevations and only venture into the lowlands seasonally, following tree flowering and fruiting events. This potential seasonal displacement would explain why some expeditions have completely overlooked it in the lowlands while others have recorded it on occasion.
</p>
            <p>
It is contentious whether the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
is endemic to Taliabu, or also occurs on the other two main islands of the Sula Archipelago (Mangole and Sanana). The latter two have received even less ornithological attention than Taliabu, and to the best of our knowledge, the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has never been recorded there on recent ornithological expeditions (D. Yong, pers. comm.; J.A. Eaton, pers. comm.). Sanana is relatively low-lying (up to ~600m) and therefore likely to lack a number of Taliabu’s montane species. Mangole reaches its highest peak at 1,127m, but areas above 800m are confined to ~328 ha only, which gives it a comparatively small area of true montane forest. The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
’s level of dependence on vegetation at high elevations probably determines whether it would be capable of occurring on Mangole or even Sanana. Future fieldwork on those two islands will shed light on whether the new species occurs there or not.
</p>
            <p>
FER and Filip Verbelen first discovered a new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
population in the mountains of Peleng in the neighboring Banggai Archipelago during a visit between 23-30 March 2009 and recorded it as reasonably common at elevations between 700-900m in the western Peleng highlands (

49

). On our collecting expedition, we only had one aural encounter of this 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
on Peleng on 21 Dec 2013, indicating that the population might have been seasonally displaced or more retiring (

19

). However, photographic evidence from the 2009 visit indicates that the Peleng population has a plumage coloration that is very similar – if not identical – to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and quite different from 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
. As this Peleng population remains uncollected, future fieldwork will hopefully produce specimens allowing a determination whether there are differences between the Peleng birds and 
<tp:taxon-name>

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu is obviously a member of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, which used to be considered a single wide-ranging polytypic species for a long time (
6 1, 7 5
), but has now been divided into multiple monotypic island endemics by most recent authors on the basis of extensive plumage differences [e.g. (
57, 8 0, 99
)]. Within this radiation, its plumage most closely resembles that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, but is discrete from both of them in multiple characters (see Diagnosis). Its morphological differences from both 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
exceed those between other closely related species pairs within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. dammermani
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
(

73

). Therefore, its diagnosis here as a species level taxon rests on Mayr and Ashlock’s (

70

) yardstick approach, by which species status is conferred on the basis of divergences that exceed those of species pairs in which biologically important differences have been unequivocally demonstrated.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters have a wide vocal repertoire that is oftentimes problematic in the context of bioacoustic analysis (

73

). The Taliabu 
<tp:taxon-name>Myzomela</tp:taxon-name>
was hardly vocal during our encounters, and we do not consider vocalizations a fruitful taxonomic avenue in delimiting this new species from others. Instead, we have generated mitochondrial sequence data to further shed light on the new species’ taxonomic status.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial evidence
: Our mitochondrial tree analysis was based on sequences of the coding gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), comparing 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
to a great majority of members of the eastern and central Indonesian radiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters. Results indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
is most closely related to geographically adjacent species such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (

). Our analysis does not provide resolution on whether either 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
constitute the sister species to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
, and in fact, the latter two may well be sister to each other instead (

), rendering 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
a more basal species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from adjacent Buru is not represented in our mitochondrial dataset, and likely forms part of this group. Based on plumage coloration, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
is frequently considered to constitute the sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, and the two are sometimes merged under one species [e.g. (

99

)]. Therefore, we assume that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
– albeit closely related – will probably not emerge as the direct sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
in future analyses.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial ND2 divergence values between 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
and its two most closely related relatives (

<tp:taxon-name>M. elisabethae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chloroptera</tp:taxon-name>

) range between 3.5%–4.3% (

), well above the mitochondrial divergence threshold of 2-3% widely postulated in the literature (
10 0, 10 1
), providing additional support for species level recognition of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>The crown (from forehead to nape) is cold brown (2.5Y 2/2), delimited below by a narrow long white supercilium from bill base to napeside. Lores dark greyish brown (2.5Y 3/1) extending to just behind eye in the form of an eyestripe cutting through a broken white eye ring formed by small feathers peripheral to the eye. Black rictal bristles. Ear coverts and malar, facial and moustachial regions show white-and-dusky grizzling. Most of upperparts, including mantle, scapulars and rump, are mid-olive (5Y 4/4), while remiges are distinctly darker-olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). The white chin and throat are characterized by sporadic dusky speckles and lemon streaks increasing towards the lower throat, and grading into a fully lemon to sulphur yellow breast and belly (5Y 9/12). The yellow on the breast and belly has an olive-mottled appearance because of olive feather tips (5Y 4/4), especially pronounced towards the flanks, and white feather bases, especially pronounced towards the abdomen. The vent is solid lemon-yellow (5Y8/7). Iris dark-brown; bill black. Tarsus, toes and claws pinkish-grey with toepads paler yellowish.</p>

Etymology

            <p>
The new species name is derived from “suara merdu” in Bahasa Indonesia, translating as “melodious voice”, referring to the pleasing vocalizations of this bird that FER heard hours before the first individual was seen, allowing for predictions prior to visual confirmation that this would be a new

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
During a visit to the highlands of Peleng between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently encountered this species at elevations between 700-900m (

49

). When hiking up to these elevations for the first time and hearing the melodious warble of this taxon in the distance, its superficial vocal resemblance to other members of the Wallacean 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation prompted FER to predict that this would be a new leaf-warbler taxon long before they laid their eyes on it. Once they first saw it, it was noticeable for its unusual behavior of frequently climbing along larger branches and trunks of trees in the manner of a treecreeper (
<tp:taxon-name>
Certhia
</tp:taxon-name>
). On our collecting expedition to Peleng between 18-23 Dec 2013, the species was less commonly encountered (

19

), probably because of seasonality.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new leaf-warbler is restricted to the highland forests of western Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago at elevations above 700m, reaching the highest island altitude above 1000m (

). Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago must be in serious doubt because only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, of which only 5 ha of land lie above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. Beyond the Banggai Archipelago,

Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). Underparts from chin to vent are largely lemon to sulphur yellow, with white feather bases creating a more lemon-yellow hue on throat, breast and belly (7.5Y 8/8) and olive feather tips (5Y 4/4) generating a more olive- mottled appearance on flanks, while the undertail coverts are largely uniform lemon (5Y 9/12).</p>

<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
A University of East Anglia expedition by Davidson et al. (

64

) was the first to find a resident population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers on Taliabu, which they encountered commonly in montane forest and which they considered to represent an undescribed taxon. Rheindt (

48

) then studied this leaf warbler during his visit between 4-18 April 2009, and we found them again during our expedition between 6-16 Dec 2 013 and collected two (

19

).

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>
Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new warbler inhabits disturbed and undisturbed montane forest on Taliabu from 700m up to probably the highest elevations above 1,400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). It may also occur on the large neighboring island of Mangole, which rises to 1,127m and should harbor enough area of montane forest habitat above 700m to sustain a population. However, a lack of fieldwork in the mountains of Mangole means that there is no information available on its montane avifauna. The smallest main constituent of the Sula Archipelago, the densely populated island of Sanana, is unlikely to sustain any 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers as it barely reaches above 600m, which seems to be too low for this species. The species is replaced on the Banggai Archipelago by the newly described 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
(see SM5), while 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
replace it in various parts of Sulawesi. Given its more relaxed elevational requirements and its tolerance for disturbed habitat, this species is probably not as immediately endangered as some of the other montane Taliabu avifauna.

and 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
)


</p>
            <p>
The leaf-warbler genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
constitutes a large Old World radiation of small passerines that is exceptionally well-studied in phylogenetic terms (
10 6-1 09
). Recent demonstrations of genus paraphyly in combination with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
[summarized in (
10 8
)] have prompted a variety of new generic treatments, including a division into two re-defined genera [
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
; see (

57

)], but we here follow the latest phylogenetic treatise that suggests a merger of all 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
into a single genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
10 8
).
</p>
            <p>
Despite the genus’s well-known evolutionary history, a sizeable sub-clade of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Australasian (including Indonesian) Archipelago has largely been omitted from modern molecular insights. Notable exceptions include the first-ever example of a new avian species description (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. rotiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) partly based on genome-wide DNA data from the Timor region (
11 0
). However, most island populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
in this region have been merged into a limited number of ‘wastebasket species’, e.g. Mountain Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trivirgatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and Island Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
, although vocal and plumage differences among them often far exceed those documented among the better- studied continental groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
8 0
). As a consequence, some modern treatments [e.g. (

57

)] have adopted a ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) in which pairwise plumage and vocal differences between archipelagic taxa that are comparable in magnitude to those between better-studied continental species pairs (or exceed them) are interpreted as being indicative of species status. In this way, a number of highly distinct island taxa have been elevated to species level, such as Buru Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. everetti
, Seram Leaf Warbler
</tp:taxon-name>
               <tp:taxon-name>
P. ceramensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[a treatment that had previously been suggested on the basis of vocal and plumage comparisons; see (

80

)], and a number of additional Wallacean taxa. Our description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
follows this framework of affording species rank to taxa when vocal and plumage characters indicate deeper divisions. We also bring genome-wide DNA data to bear on the taxonomic classification of these two new species. However, following the yardstick approach as applied under the Biological Species Concept, we believe that biological characters, especially bioacoustic ones, will be the most important indicators when conferring species status in 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers.

<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and

differ from each other and from surrounding taxa in a number of important traits (see Diagnosis for each taxon) which are far more salient than the plumage differences of often identical-looking species pairs on the Asian continent that are otherwise vocally and phylogenetically deeply diverged [e.g. the three members of the Arctic Warbler

trio; (

)]. Most importantly, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
has a contrastingly white throat and supercilium and a grey-and-white grizzled auricular patch where all other surrounding taxa are much more yellowish, rendering it instantly recognizable in large series of specimens. In contrast, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is superficially reminiscent of Sulawesi Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
in its overall more yellowish coloration, displaying a phenotypic leapfrog pattern that has been documented from the Taliabu-Peleng-Sulawesi island trio on multiple previous occasions (
50, 7 2
). However, this superficial resemblance notwithstanding, it has important distinctions in bare-parts coloration and overall pigmentation (see Diagnosis), apart from obvious vocal differences.

Bioacoustic evidence
: In bioacoustic terms, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by melodious jumbles of 1–1.5sec, mostly at 2000–6000 Hz, with short individual high notes between 5000–7000 Hz occasionally interspersed. Song motifs generally lack repetitive element sequences or trills (

). In contrast, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by 1.5–3sec strophes mostly between 2000–6500 Hz (typically of a wider frequency range than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
) that constitute a melodious jumble often followed by a final repetitive phrase, which can sometimes be omitted (

). In this respect, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is slightly more reminiscent of the East Sulawesi population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng (despite the geographic proximity of the latter two). The 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
population on Gunung Tumpu (East Sulawesi) is often characterized by strong repetitive series at a very broad frequency range (2500–7000 Hz), mostly preceded by a variable but simple melodious series of elements between 2000–5000 Hz and a brief nasal note separating this variable series from the repetitive series (

). Depending on the presence or absence of components, the song rendition (=motif) can be 1.5–4sec long. In summary, the songs of these three forms (

<tp:taxon-name>P. suaramerdu</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. emilsalimi</tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
), while highly variable, are predictably different and strongly indicative of species status when put into the context of song differences among other 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
species (

).

Genomic evidence
: We generated a set of ~4,100 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment spanning almost 3 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial cytochrome- 
b
(cyt- 
b
) sequences, to shed light on the differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in separate Methods paragraphs below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three taxa (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
from East Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population-genomic space based on ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (

). The main division according to genomic PCA occurred between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
versus the other two taxa (PC1 in 

). The same relationship was strongly reflected in maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of concatenated genome-wide sequence alignments of almost 3 million base pairs length as well as in maximum-parsimony (MP) analysis of a concatenated set of ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (topology 1 in 

). In contrast, mitochondrial cyt- 
b
gene analysis and species-tree inference of genome-wide SNPs recovered a topology in which 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
were strongly supported sister lineages, with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
being more basal (topology 2 in 

). Depths of uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence (as determined by cyt- 
b
distances) were comparatively low across all three leaf-warblers (0.7-1.6%; 

).
</p>
            <p>
In summary, our phylogenomic analyses demonstrated considerable incongruence among tree topologies, including a strong mito-nuclear discordance that calls into doubt the reliability of mitochondrial divergence values in this dataset. For instance, the deepest genomic divergence was detected between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other two species (PC1 in 

), whereas on mitochondrial cyt- 
b
evidence 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
displayed some of the most shallow divergences from the other taxa (

). The use of mitochondrial divergences in species delimitation suffers from multiple confounding biases (
79, 10 0, 10 1
), especially when dealing with complexes containing closely-allied allopatric taxa that have a propensity for secondary gene flow (
11 2-11 4
). The best explanatory hypothesis for the pronounced mito- nuclear discordance in this dataset is that occasional overwater dispersal followed by hybridization and gene flow may have led to the introgression of foreign alleles in one or the other species, obfuscating clean branching patterns. Gene flow during sporadic hybridization is known to artifactually reduce mitochondrial divergences, masking deeper levels of genomic differentiation (

79

). Hence, introgression can account for the presence of relatively low mitochondrial divergences in a group of species characterized by comparatively deep genomic divergences and pronounced levels of bioacoustic differentiation [(

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted DNA from the fresh muscle tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and the three specimens collected by us (including the holotype) of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
, along with one individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
that we had collected on Mt Tumpu on the eastern peninsula of Sulawesi (

19

). Additional tissue samples were obtained from the American Museum of Natural History, New York (AMNH): three samples of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
from South Sulawesi and an outgroup sample of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus pallescens
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Solomon Islands. The AMNH samples were only used for phylogenomic rooting. DNA extraction was performed using the Exgene Clinic SV kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul) following the manufacturer’s instructions. We eluted the DNA in two consecutive rounds of 100μl molecular grade water. We prepared double-digest restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing (ddRADSeq) libraries using the same protocol as Garg et al. (
11 5
) with EcoRI and MspI as restriction enzymes. We quantified DNA and library product concentrations using the Qubit 2.0 Broad Range DNA Assay (Invitrogen, California), and used a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Iowa) to perform final quality checks on the library product. The genomic libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform at the Singapore Center for Environmental Life Science Engineering. Filtering and demultiplexing of the genomic data in STACKS 1.34 followed the same general procedures as detailed by Ng et al. (
7 2
), and are the result of comprehensive trials using a wide variety of different parameters and settings at each step of the analysis. DNA data is deposited with Genbank at BioProject accession number PRJNA566263.
</p>
            <p>
SNP calling and genomic supermatrix generation:
Reference genome alignment was performed using BWA 0.7.12 (
9 1
) and samtools 0.1.19 (http://samtools.sourceforge.net) (
9 2, 9 3
) on the Greenish Warbler (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
) genome (
11 6
), the most closely related available full genome. We performed SNP calling in STACKS 1.34 as per Ng et al. (
7 2
). We required loci to be present across all individuals, and retained one random SNP per locus to exclude obviously linked SNP loci. Subsequently, we used PLINK 1.9 (
11 7
) and Bayescan 2.1 (
11 8
) to filter SNPs for linkage disequilibrium and signs of selection. Data format manipulation and conversions were performed with PGDSpider (
1 19
). The final filtered dataset totaled 4,104 SNPs. In addition, we created concatenated SNP datasets for each group for use in downstream maximum parsimony analysis.
</p>
            <p>
Following the procedures used by Ng et al. (
7 2
), we generated a concatenated read supermatrix without missing data using pyRAD (
12 0
). We stipulated a minimum required locus coverage of 20, and kept the clustering threshold within and between reads at the default of 0.88. The final concatenated read supermatrix amounted to 2,861,661 bp in length, generated from 19,985 loci.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial sequence generation:
We sequenced cyt- 
b
using the primers H16065 (
12 1
) and L14995 (
12 2
), with 40 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 72°C. We conducted PCR product cleanup with ExoSAP-IT 
®
and used the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) for cycle- sequencing. Sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer using capillary electrophoresis. We assembled cyt- 
b
sequences with CodonCode Aligner 4.1 and aligned them with ClustalW (
12 3
). The final cyt- 
b
alignment was 1,100bp long, indel- free and fully translatable. Mitochondrial sequences have been deposited with Genbank at accession numbers 
MN518858
- 
MN518862
.
</p>
            <p>
Population structure inference:
In order to test for the presence of geographic structuring across East Sulawesi, Peleng, and Taliabu, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the genomic SNP data. PCA was performed using ade4 (
12 4
) and factoextra (
12 5
), both available as R packages (
12 6
).
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial tree inference:
We constructed phylogenetic cyt- 
b
trees using two methods: maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML). We ran MP analyses using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
), performing 10,000 bootstrap replicates. For ML analyses, we first used jModelTest v2.1.6 (

97

) and determined that the Jukes-Cantor model (
12 8
) was the best performing substitution model. We then ran RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) using the extensive subtree-pruning-regrafting tree search algorithm.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic tree inference:
We applied three different genomic tree inference analyses: coalescent-based species tree inference (applied to the SNP dataset), maximum likelihood tree inference (applied to concatenated read supermatrix), and maximum parsimony tree inference (applied to the concatenated SNP dataset). We performed species tree inference using SNAPP (
1 29
) as implemented in BEAST 2.3.0, performing two iterations using default settings. Tracer 1.6 was used after each iteration to ensure that the runs had reached convergence, after which LogCombiner v2.3.0 and DensiTree (
13 0
) were used to process results. We carried out ML tree inference using RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) on the concatenated read supermatrix using the general-time-reversible gamma-invariant (GTRGAMMA) model and performed 1,000 rapid bootstrap searches. Finally, we conducted conventional MP analysis on the concatenated SNPs of each taxon set, using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
) and running 10,000 bootstrap replicates to evaluate branch support.

            <p>Crown bright rufous (7.5YR 6/10) from nape to forehead, including single rows of feathers below the eye. Posterior auriculars are mid-brown (7.5YR 3.5/3) grading into a pale orange- rufescent (7.5YR 7/6) frontwards towards the malar and moustachial regions. Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts are bronzy olive (2.5Y 3/4), the remiges and rectrices slightly darker and with more coppery edging (10YR 4/6). Dull white on breast reaches to chin, with an orange-rufescent tinge (7.5YR 7/6) surrounding the breast laterally and ventrally. Yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, with a rufescent-orange suffusion to flanks (7.5YR 7/6). Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Dark-horn mandible. Yellow-orange tarsus on live bird.

One of the phenotypically most distinct subspecies of the Mountain Tailorbird or Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Uniquely among all subspecies, the new taxon has a rufescent suffusion on throat and breast, becoming especially pronounced on breast sides and auriculars (from where it grades into the rufous crown), rendering the bird’s anterior aspect much warmer-tinged than all other subspecies. The upperparts, especially upper wings, are also warmer bronzy and the flanks tinged more rufescent than all other subspecies, making this the most reddish-looking taxon in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. It additionally differs from most other subspecies (except those from Sulawesi and Peleng) in the rufous crown’s more posterior extension to the nape and in the absence of a pale supercilium.
</p>
            <p>
It further differs from

cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis

malayanus
(Malay Peninsula) and all subspecies further to the north and west in the absence of a strong grey hindcollar band and/or strongly grey breast sides. In many aspects, the new taxon is similar to the set of subspecies on Sulawesi (
riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow on belly and lower breast (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near- complete absence of yellow, respectively). For additional differences from the new subspecies on Peleng, see SM8.

Davidson et al. (

<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoiler (then called an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird) for Taliabu, and characterized the population as inhabiting montane forest above 500m and possibly in need of taxonomic description. FER found this population commonly in disturbed montane forest to over 1,100 m, with a few records in dense secondary bamboo thickets down to 50m (

48

), and our collecting expedition re-encountered this form abundantly at elevations around 1,300m (

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, this new subspecies is currently only known from Taliabu in the Sula Archipelago. There, it inhabits disturbed situations (forest edge, bamboo thickets) mostly in the mountains, with the highest record at 1300m, but presumably ranging to the highest point at over 1400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). On other islands, mountain leaftoilers rarely range lower than ~500m (

57

), but Rheindt (

48

) exceptionally recorded the new taxon on Taliabu from an extensive bamboo thicket at ~50m, demonstrating that this population may tolerate lower elevations. The presence of this leaftoiler on the other two main Sula islands, Mangole and Sanana, is likely, especially on the former, which rises to over 1,100m, but perhaps also on the latter, which reaches to a little over 600m. However, it has probably been overlooked owing to a lack of fieldwork at higher elevations on these two islands. On the Banggai Archipelago, the species is represented by another novel subspecies (see below) that replaces 
sulanus
there. Its predilection for disturbed forest situations and wide elevational tolerance as compared to other insular mountain birds probably means that it is currently not of conservation concern.

Crown and nape rich rufous (2.5YR 4/10), slightly darker posteriorly, and not extending as far onto the nape as in the new Taliabu subspecies (
P. c. sulanus
; see SM7). Short blackish eyestripe. Facial region from auriculars to lores dusky-grey (N3) with an increasing rufous suffusion (concolorous with crown) towards the malar and moustachial regions. Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts olive with a slight bronzy hue (5Y 3/4), colder-colored than in the new subspecies from Taliabu (
P. c. sulanus
). Remiges and rectrices are darker and duskier, but with outer edging nearly concolorous with mantle. Underparts are bicolored, with a white chin to breast, and a lemon-yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, and with a dusky olive suffusion on the flanks. Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Tarsus dark-yellow. On the live bird, the upper mandible was black with a yellow tip, and the lower mandible was black with a yellow base and tip. The iris color was not clearly discerned on the live bird.

            <p>
A distinct new subspecies of Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(or ‘Mountain Tailorbird’), differing from adjacent subspecies to the east and to the west in important discrete characters.
</p>
            <p>
The lack of a supercilium and the posterior extension of the rufous crown coloration onto the mid-nape set this subspecies apart from most other subspecies, except those from Sulawesi and Taliabu, which have an equally or sometimes even slightly more extensive rufous crown. It further differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis
(Borneo), 
malayanus
(Malay Peninsula) and all subspecies further west and north in the absence of a strong grey hindcollar band and/or strongly grey breast sides; from 
<tp:taxon-name>
batjanensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(Bacan Island) in its lemon-yellow belly lacking a strong olive suffusion; and from 
dumasi
(Seram and Buru) in its much less brown-colored upperparts. In many aspects, the new taxon is similar to the set of subspecies on Sulawesi (
riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow belly (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near-complete absence of yellow, respectively).
</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies shares many unique traits with the new subspecies from Taliabu 
sulanus
(see SM7), but differs significantly in its darker chestnut crown and its less reddish overall appearance, largely lacking a rufescent suffusion to the breast and flanks, and showing much less rufescent on the auriculars; its flanks are also much colder olive-washed (versus warmly rufescent-washed), and the upperparts and especially upper wings are colder bronze-olive. On live birds, the legs are much darker and less intensely colorful than those of birds from Taliabu.

Typical of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers, this new taxon is restricted to forest edge situations, treefall gaps and bamboo thickets in montane forest on the island of Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago. During our combined visits to the island (

19
, 
49

), we recorded this new taxon from 750m to the highest point at over 1000m elevation. It may, therefore, not range as low as the new taxon from neighboring Taliabu, although future fieldwork may well produce lower elevational records. Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago is unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new subspecies. Despite its very small range, its predilection for disturbed forest situations probably means that it is not particularly negatively affected by the current degradation that is impacting most highland forests of western Peleng.

Taxonomic rationale (combined for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus sulanus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
P. c. relictus
)


</p>
            <p>
The Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
was previously thought to be an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird and then called Mountain Tailorbird. We here acknowledge the distant relationship to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbirds (
13 1
) and therefore follow the recent trend of calling members of this species ‘leaftoilers’ rather than tailorbirds [e.g. (

57

)], a fitting translation from their re- instated scientific genus name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
. As for the species name 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, we follow the recently proposed emendation (

6

) of the original spelling of the name (‘ 
cuculatus’
) on the basis of information in the original description showing that the name was meant to refer to the birds’ hooded appearance (from Latin cucullus – hood).
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: The new subspecies 
sulanus
from Taliabu is arguably one of the most distinctly-colored, if not the single most distinctly-colored subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(see Diagnosis) and is therefore well-deserving of subspecies status. Its reddish-suffused anterior body renders it instantly recognizable among any series of specimens. Although not as unique in morphology, we also describe 
relictus
from Peleng at the subspecific level mainly on the basis of its distinct coloration. In plumage distinctness, 
relictus
far exceeds several other previously recognized subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, such as 
P. c. cinereicollis
.
</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic evidence
: We have been unsuccessful in procuring a sufficiently large sample set of song recordings of the two new subspecies, precluding rigorous bioacoustic analysis. However, we note that the songs given by these two subspecies in the field did not strike us as very different from the songs of other subspecies we are familiar with. Song playback with recordings from several other islands elicited a ready response at least in 
P. c. relictus
. Based on our bioacoustic experience with Indonesian passerines, we do not have the impression that song differences of the two new subspecies would warrant anything but a subspecific treatment at the present time.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic evidence
: We created a set of ~8,500 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment of over 2 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase intron 2 (ND2) sequences, to investigate levels of differentiation among 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in a separate Methods paragraph below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three subspecies (
P. c. stentor
from eastern Sulawesi, 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng and 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population- genomic space (

). The main genomic division according to a PCA based on ~8,500 SNPs occurred between 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu versus the other two subspecies (PC1 in 

). In contrast to the leaf-warbler analysis (see SM6), this main genomic division among leaftoilers was also supported by the mitochondrial tree and the genomic ‘species tree’ (

), consistently placing 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng close to 
P. c. stentor
from Sulawesi, although the concatenated tree built from genome-wide loci was in conflict, placing 
P. c. relictus
closer to 
P. c. sulanus
. Coincidentally, the majority tree with a basal placement of 
sulanus
(topology 1 in 

) is also the arrangement that would be supported by the extraordinarily divergent plumage of 
sulanus
, making it unique among all leaftoiler subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
Pairwise divergences between the subspecies (as determined by ND2 distances) were relatively low (0.3-1.7%; 

), at levels generally accepted to be below the species threshold for birds [(~2-3%; (
100, 10 1
)], consistent with the current proposed subspecies status. These ND2 divergences further supported the majority tree (topology 1 in 

) by consistently rendering 
P. c. sulanus
as the most deeply diverged subspecies (up to ~1.7%), whereas 
P. c. relictus
and 
P. c. stentor
emerged as only 0.3% diverged.
</p>
            <p>
In summary, mitochondrial sequence analysis, PCA of genome-wide SNPs and ‘species-tree’ analysis all agree in placing 
P. c. sulanus
basal to the other two subspecies, an arrangement supported by its distinct plumage. Therefore, we have no reason to suspect bias in the mitochondrial divergence depth (unlike in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
, see SM6), which supports our bioacoustic assessment that both 
relictus
and 
sulanus
are at the subspecies level. Future studies of the uniquely colored 
P. c. sulanus
may yet challenge this assessment.
</p>
            <p>
Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted genomic DNA of all tissue material available for 
P. c. sulanus
(n=5) and 
P. c. relictus
(n=2), along with two samples of 
P. c. stentor
that we had independently collected on Mt Tumpu on the adjacent eastern Sulawesi peninsula (

19

). Tissue of a single individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cettia parens
</tp:taxon-name>
from Makira in the Solomon Islands, provided by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was also extracted to serve as an outgroup in phylogenomic rooting. Laboratory and analytical protocols followed our procedures outlined in SM6 (under 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
), utilizing the same reference genome (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
), but using a minimum stack depth of 5 in STACKS 1.34 and a minimum required locus coverage of 5 in pyRAD due to differences in sequencing quality. The final filtered dataset for the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers totaled 8,515 SNPs and the final concatenated read supermatrix was 2,002,726 bp long, generated from 13,194 separate loci. For mitochondrial analysis, we sequenced ND2 using the primers L5219Met and H6313Trp (
13 2
) with 35 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 50-53°C, but otherwise following the procedures as outlined in SM6. The final ND2 alignment for the leaftoilers was 1,015bp long, indel-free and fully translatable. All DNA data has been deposited with Genbank at accession number PRJNA566263 and 
MN518850

Hartert, 1920 (‘extremely neglected’) from Selayar Island, were based on the impression that the description of these birds had escaped the attention of researchers for too long. The presently described taxon, only discovered in the 21

century, fulfils that criterion even more adequately, so we take pleasure in naming it 
omississimus
(‘the most neglected’), superlative of ‘omissus’.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The immature plumage remains undocumented. The only two male specimens known to exist (holotype and MZB.Ornit.34.488) show minimal plumage variation, the only difference perhaps being the latter specimen’s slightly brighter, more brilliant rump and darker, more blackish tarsus and claws in life.</p>
            <p>As compared to males, the three female specimens have a duller blue supercilium (but still discernible), lack a black chin, have prominent rufous spectacles over a narrow blackish stripe through the cere, the rufous continuing to the lower sides of the face where it is finely speckled dark (in two of three females the speckling continues to the throat sides), and have much less dark blackish-blue auriculars, contrasting less with the rufous throat. The female’s upperparts are less brilliant blue. One of the three female specimens is slightly paler on the tarsus and claws.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new subspecies was first reported by Indrawan et al. (
13 3
), who documented the sighting of a female on 15 May 2001 and a male on 29 July 2001 at 50-100m elevation around Benteng on the main island of Togian, and pointed out that this new population may be an undescribed subspecies. Following their footsteps, Filip Verbelen (pers. comm.) made the first sound recordings of the new population in December 2008 when studying a few individuals on Kadidiri, a tiny forested tourist resort island off the coast of Togian measuring ~4km in length and less than 1km in width. A few days later, F. Verbelen moved to Batudaka, one of the three main islands of the archipelago, where he found additional individuals in coastal forest near the capital town of Wakai. FER visited Batudaka Island from 23-27 April 2009 and observed this new population. On our collecting trip, we visited Batudaka from 24-28 Dec 2013 and found this taxon to be common in the forests outside the capital town of Wakai, collecting the present material in the process (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>The new subspecies is known from the Togian Archipelago in the Gulf of Tomini, a satellite group of islands between the northern and eastern peninsulas of Sulawesi. More specifically, to the best of our knowledge the new subspecies has so far been found on the two main islands of Togian and Batudaka, as well as on the tiny islet of Kadidiri off Togian, where it is common in remnant forest and edge from near sea level to at least ~200m elevation. However, it is likely that the birds occur up to the highest elevations at ~430m on these islands. More field research is required to map this subspecies’ occurrence on other islands in this archipelago. Its presence on some of the larger, forest-covered islands in close proximity to Batudaka and Togian, such as Talatakoh, Waleakodi and Waleabahi, is virtually guaranteed, given its occurrence on tiny Kadidiri. However, its presence on slightly more distant islands, such as Puah (at ~18km from the main archipelago) and Unauna (at ~28km from the main archipelago) is less certain, although these latter islands are connected to the main archipelago by shallow sea-beds not exceeding 120m depth, indicating that they would have been connected with one another during glacial sea level recessions.</p>
            <p>
On the main island of Sulawesi, the newly described 
omississimus
is replaced by the nominate taxon 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Unusually, however, the nominate form on Sulawesi is a hill and montane forest denizen, occurring from 500-2300m elevation and shunning lowland forest habitats in stark contrast to the new subspecies.
</p>
            <p>The new subspecies appears to be moderately tolerant to habitat disturbance where small-scale timber extraction leads to a secondarization of primary forest. However, the taxon disappears where forest is converted into agricultural land. Although Togian’s forests are quickly dwindling, with most remnants by now secondary and restricted to inland locations away from the coast, far more than half of the islands should still be suitable for the new taxon, making it safe for the time being.</p>

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The proposed English name of this new taxon follows a recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] to call members of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
‘jungle-flycatchers’ rather than ‘blue-flycatchers’ because molecular data (
13 4
) and bioacoustic considerations (
57, 7 4
) strongly suggest a merger of many members of the previously recognized jungle-flycatcher genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinomyias
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Given that numerous species in the resultant genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
are no longer blue but entirely brown, the name ‘blue-flycatcher’, while formerly appropriate, is no longer suitable for this genus.
</p>
            <p>
Although distinguishable from other subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
in terms of plumage characters (see Diagnosis), 
omississimus
is quite similar to them in general coloration. At any rate, plumage coloration is not an ideal taxonomic indicator in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
jungle-flycatchers, many of which boast a highly conserved male plumage sporting blue upperparts and reddish underparts. Other characters, such as bioacoustic and genetic ones, may be more conducive to guiding taxonomic decision-making in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
We recently published a bioacoustic comparison on the basis of six vocal parameters among members of the greater 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, showing that the song of the newly described 
omississimus
from Togian exhibits considerable vocal overlap with the songs of all three analyzed subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
, while distinctly differing from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. kalaoensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[see 

in (
7 4
)]. This vocal evidence along with Togian’s proximity to Sulawesi suggest a placement of 
omississimus
as a subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Based on a lack of deep differentiation in both bioacoustic and genetic evidence, we propose to classify this new taxon at the subspecies level. Upon first discovery in the field, we were generally impressed by its lowland forest occurrence, which stands in contrast to the montane forest requirements of the nominate subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi. This pronounced difference in habitat preference was given much weight in supporting species- level recognition of the new Togian population in a recently published field guide to the region (

57

). However, given Gwee et al.’s (
7 4
) newly published data, the latter treatment has ultimately proved erroneous.

(North Sumatra) in its lack of strong blackish tones in the plumage. It conspicuously differs from the larger, longer-winged 
celebensis
and 
hygroscopus
from nearby Sulawesi as well as from Greater Sundaic 
indrapurae
, 
javanicus
, 
stresemanni, biesenbachi, fumidus, seebohmi
and 
whiteheadi
in its lack of solid white or rufous on the belly; its uniform dark-brown coloration in which only the underparts show a faint warm tinge; and its unmarked dark-brown vent. The new subspecies has a darker hood and breast than the above-mentioned taxa except for the intensely rufous-bellied 
fumidus
and perhaps 
hygroscopus
. It also differs from 
deningeri
from Seram in its paler, browner (less black) body color, with a darker non-contrasting hood, and differs from 
schlegelii
and 
sterlingi
(both from Timor) in its less olive overall coloration and lack of rufous belly and vent.
</p>
            <p>
Within Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely resembles the much larger and longer-winged 
versteegi
and 
papuensis
from Papua but is dark slaty-brown (versus black) in overall body color and has an unmarked vent. The lower underparts have more extensive and paler-cinnamon feather margins in the new subspecies versus narrower, more rufous feather margins in the Papuan forms.
</p>
            <p>
Among geographically more distant Island Thrush subspecies from outside of Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely approaches three taxa from the Solomon Islands (
bougainvillei, kulambangrae, sladeni)
and two taxa from the Bismarck Archipelago (
heinrothi, beehleri
), but lacks those subspecies’ blackish overall body color. It also superficially resembles 
nigrorum
from Negros (Philippines), but the latter subspecies’ lower belly grades into whitish on the vent while the new subspecies is uniformly dark on those parts. Furthermore, another Philippine subspecies, 
kelleri
from Mt Apo (Mindanao), is similar to the new subspecies but becomes darker brown towards the front of the head while the new subspecies has a nearly uniform head coloration becoming slightly paler on the forehead.

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The subspecies name, translated from Bahasa Indonesia “it likes the rain” (=suka hujan), refers to the circumstances surrounding the bird’s discovery. On FER’s first expedition to the highest parts of Taliabu (

48

), heavy persistent rain impeded bird observations, leading to a decision to abort the expedition ahead of schedule. On his premature descent, FER then spotted a hardy individual of the new thrush, perched in the pouring rain, leading him to change plans yet again and mount a subsequent second and eventually third expedition to these elevations in better weather. This latter third expedition then allowed for a more detailed documentation of Taliabu’s distinct novel montane avifauna (

19
, 
48

). The name 
sukahujan
is treated as an inalienable noun in apposition.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>All nine specimens procured resemble one another considerably in coloration. The greatest variation occurs in the tone of the lower breast and abdomen, which is intermediate in the holotype but ranges from all-drab brownish grey throughout with almost no warm edging (in MZB.Ornit.34.416) to more extensive cinnamon feather edging (in most adult females, especially MZB.Ornit.34.409), the latter leading to an overall warmer underparts impression. Females are variably slightly less slaty on upperparts and crown, and one adult individual (MZB.Ornit.34.416) of unknown sex has a male-like slaty tone on upperparts but a female- like crown color that is more suffused with dull brown. Two juveniles (MZB.Ornit.34.410; MZB.Ornit.34.417) exhibit noticeable mottling on their mantle and underparts coloration, caused by dark brownish-black feather margins contrasting against the paler (on underparts sometimes warm cinnamon) feather centers.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new taxon was first discovered on 8 and 9 April 2009 by FER near its type locality on the occasion of a hike to the highest elevations on Taliabu that was cut short by heavy rainfall. Subsequent sightings on 14 and 15 April 2009 were made in the same area on the occasion of a return visit (

48

). We found this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected the type along with the accompanying specimens.

<tp:taxon-name>
T. poliocephalus

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
With approximately 50 subspecies, the Island Thrush 
<tp:taxon-name>
Turdus poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
is arguably the most polytypic bird species on Earth (
13 5
). Attempts to separate this variable species complex into smaller species-level lineages [e.g. (
13 6
)] have been called into question by genetic data showing that plumage characters are not a good predictor of close relationships in this complex (
13 7
). Hence, modern sources generally continue to unite all or most subspecies into one polytypic species. Not unlike some Philippine subspecies previously under study (
13 7
), the new subspecies from Taliabu is phenotypically extremely different from neighboring forms but more closely resembles certain geographically distant subspecies. It is presently best accommodated at the subspecies level. Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic inquiries are needed in the future to assess whether any internal species limits must be drawn within the complex. Such future analyses may well elevate the Taliabu Island Thrush to species level. However, such analyses are currently hampered by a lack of crucial comparative DNA material.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Forehead to crown and nape dark slaty blue (2.5PB 2/2) with slightly scaly appearance generated through narrow black feather centres; the same color, but without the scaly appearance, then continues through mantle and scapulars to rump. A white supercilium starts above the centre of the eye and ends just shy of the bill base, becoming narrower towards the front. A black facial patch centred in the loral region and below the supercilium to the chin (with narrow rows of black feathers above the bill base) grades into dark slaty blue coloration (2.5PB 1.5/2) towards the auriculars and the malar and moustachial regions, merging with the nape and mantle. Upperwing coverts largely concolorous with crown, with vestiges of an extremely indistinct brighter carpal patch visible with difficulty on this specimen. Remiges are dark slaty brown (10YR 2.5/1), the larger primaries with warmer, paler outer edging (10YR 4/2). Breast intensely rufous (7.5YR 7/12), becoming slightly paler on throat and upper flanks, and becoming pale cinnamon-whitish on belly and lower flanks (7.5YR 9/4), and eventually off-white on undertail coverts. Tail dull black on upper side, blackish-grey (N2) on underside, with indistinct white base to outermost rectrices. Iris dark-brown; legs light-pink; black bill with pinkish gape flange on live bird.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
An unequivocal member of the Snowy-browed Flycatcher 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ficedula hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
, and one of its most easterly outposts, with minor plumage distinctions in the male and major plumage distinctions in the female, a combination of which conclusively demarcates this new taxon from other subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
The male subtly differs from adjacent insular subspecies to the south and to the west, namely from the two Sulawesi subspecies (
jugosae, annalisa
), from 
sumatrana
(Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo), from 
vulcani
(Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores), and from 
alifura
(Buru), in the reduction of white patches at the base of the outer tail feathers, and in the slightly less extensive rufous underparts, replaced on the belly by pale cinnamon- whitish. In contrast, males of the only subspecies to the east and north (
pallidipectus
from Bacan Island) are markedly paler on the underparts than the males of this new subspecies, and have more contrastingly olive flanks. The white supercilium in males of the new subspecies is narrower than that of at least 
sumatrana, vulcani
, and 
alifura
.
</p>
            <p>
The female is highly distinct from most subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
in her bluish (versus olive, brown or grey-brown) upperparts coloration, extensive cold-brown mottling on breast (versus little to none), and a washed-out face pattern ghosting that of the male, with a whiter (versus rufous) brow. The only other subspecies that equals female 
F. h. betinabiru
in her bluish tinge to the upperparts is 
alifura
from adjacent Buru, in which the back color is ever so slightly brighter-blue. Compared to the new subspecies, the female of 
alifura
exhibits a more rufous (less white) eye brow, and brighter and more extensive rufous underparts with less brown mottling.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>
Only adult specimens have been procured, although a photo of a 
pullus
near the nest suggests an early juvenile plumage similar to other subspecies. Among adults, tarsus color as recorded in the field on live birds appears to vary individually from light-pink to pinkish-horn.
</p>
            <p>There is minor variation among the nine adult male specimens procured in the lower extent of the rufous breast, the intensity of the cinnamon wash to the belly, thickness of the supercilium and the extent of vestigial white patches on the basal outer rectrices. There is minor variation among the five adult female specimens in the intensity of brown mottling on the underparts, width and paleness of the supercilium and the presence or absence of a slight brownish tinge to the lowermost mantle portion.</p>

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies of Snowy-browed Flycatcher was first encountered by the University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 (
64, 9 8
). Members of that survey found the new taxon predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m) and suggested that it may be a novel subspecies. FER then saw one adult male at 1100m during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu on 5 April 2009 (

48

). We returned to this general area between 6-16 December 2013, where we found 
betinabiru
as one of the most common constituents of the forest interior understorey avifauna and collected the type and accompanying individuals at ~1300m (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
Subspecies 
betinabiru
is currently only known from the understorey of dense montane forest in the highlands of Taliabu at above 800m elevation (
19, 48, 64, 9 8
). Extensive logging has occurred across the highlands of Taliabu, with some parts of the mountains additionally affected by large-scale forest fires (see Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler account in SM3; 

). As an understory inhabitant, 
betinabiru
would be particularly susceptible to this kind of habitat degradation and is therefore probably declining. Nevertheless, it remains extremely common where good habitat persists, as indicated by our high mistnet capture rates (

19

).
</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, Snowy-browed Flycatchers have not been detected on the two other main islands of the Sula Archipelago, although their occurrence is possible at least on Mangole, which rises to 1,127m, while very unlikely on Sanana, which does not rise taller than ~600m. If confirmed on Mangole, it is likely that the local population would refer to the same subspecies 
betinabiru
.
</p>
            <p>
On the adjacent Banggai Archipelago, a single Snowy-browed Flycatcher was recorded once in April 2009 at 800-900m on the tallest island of Peleng (

49

). To the best of our knowledge, there have not been subsequent records from this island despite extensive fieldwork. In the absence of photos or closer details about the single Peleng record, it is impossible to ascertain whether the Peleng population is ascribable to 
betinabiru
, to one of the two Sulawesi races (
annalisa, jugosae
) or to a novel unnamed subspecies.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We describe this new taxon on the basis of its characteristic plumage (especially in females). These plumage distinctions certainly warrant a description at the subspecific level as they exceed those of several more poorly marked subspecies within this complex (e.g. 
annalisa
[Stresemann, 1931], which only subtly differs from 
jugosae
[Riley, 1921]). Bioacoustic variation in this species complex is poorly explored, but the high-pitched courtship vocalization of the new subspecies superficially resembles that of many other subspecies, and playback of songs from other subspecies elicits a ready response from members of this population. Genetic differences between the new taxon and other subspecies remain unexplored.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Crown, nape, ear coverts and neck sides are mid-brown (7.5YR 4/2), with a distinct cinnamon-chestnut forehead extending over eye (7.5YR 4/8). Black rictal bristles. Nape color slowly grading into warmer cinnamon-rufous (2.5YR 4/10) across mantle, scapulars and rump to the basal 60% portion of tail. The outer remiges are mostly dark dusky-brown (7.5YR 2/1), becoming paler and more olive-brown (7.5YR 4/2) towards the inner remiges. All remiges have narrow but intense rufous outer edging concolorous with rump and lower back color. The wing coverts are almost identical to the inner remiges in color, with an increasing intensity and width of bright-rufous feather tipping towards the median and lesser coverts. The distal 40% of the tail is greyish-black (N2), with paler rufous tips (5YR 5/6) on the underside only. Chin and throat form a white triangle delimited below by a conspicuous large black breast patch. A diffuse band of grey coloration (N5) with a black scaly appearance created by black feathers with narrow grey edging demarcates the black breast patch on its lower side. The belly is pale buff (7.5YR 9/8), grading into a richer, fuller hue on the flanks and undertail coverts (7.5YR 5/6). The iris is dark-brown, the bill black with a pinkish base to the lower mandible, and the tarsus on the live bird was described as pinkish- horn.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A mid-sized, rufous-toned 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura
</tp:taxon-name>
typical of a radiation of fantails distributed throughout Australasia. It most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
(

57

), and constitutes the third member of this radiation. Its plumage distinctions from the other two species are subtle yet consistent. However, the most characteristic distinction is its unique courtship vocalization (
7 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, the new species differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Sula Islands in its much narrower, less distinct rufous tips to the underside of the rectrices, in its more distinct black scaling below the black breast patch, and in its more strongly cinnamon-buff (less white) central underparts. The new species’ throat is cleaner white, less interspersed with dusky tips to the feathers.
</p>
            <p>
The new species differs from all three subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi in its wider black portion of the tail and its warmer brown crown and upper mantle. When compared to the geographically most closely adjacent subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni toradja
</tp:taxon-name>
from eastern and central Sulawesi, the new species additionally differs in its cleaner white throat and slightly less conspicuous scaling below the black breast patch, while it is additionally distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
of the Lompobattang Massif in South Sulawesi by its blacker breast patch and by the richer chestnut (less cinnamon) coloration of its brighter body parts (such as supercilium, rear upperparts, flanks and vent).

Etymology

</p>
            <p>The new species’ epithet is in honor of the late Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie (deceased 11 Sep 2019), the third president of the Republic of Indonesia. President Habibie was known as a keen environmentalist and contributed greatly to the science and conservation of nature in Indonesia.</p>

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The only three specimens (all adult; one female, two males) exhibit limited variation in terms of extent of breast patch and black mottling below breast patch that may have been caused by the preparation of the specimens.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new species has doubtless been known to the local inhabitants of Peleng Island for a long time. Mochamad Indrawan was presumably the first outside ornithologist to see this new bird when encountering a dead individual during his work on Peleng in the mid-2000s and re- encountering the species in the wild on several undated occasions (

49

). During a field trip between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently observed the species near the type locality (

49

), where we returned from 18-23 Dec 2013 to collect the type and the accompanying individuals (

19

).

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>
Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new species is restricted to montane forest on the island of Peleng, the largest landmass in the Banggai Archipelago, at elevations not lower than 750m (

19
, 
49

) (

). Over two longer visits to the highlands of Peleng, we found that the species becomes gradually more common towards higher elevations before it seems to drop out somewhere slightly below the tallest peak on Peleng at 1,022m. The new species is replaced on Sulawesi to the west by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
, and on the Sula Archipelago to the east by 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Its occurrence on other islands of the Banggai Archipelago is highly unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
must be considered threatened given the small extent of its occurrence and the continuing loss of its habitat. Only 25,071 ha of land on Peleng fall above the approximate 750m elevational cutoff, most of it formerly constituting a single contiguous block of highland forest (

). However, our own observations in combination with satellite imagery indicate extensive forest loss to small-scale agriculture and logging by burgeoning village communities. Google Earth’s present coverage of the area is mixed, with large swathes covered by insufficient or outdated (e.g., 2004) imagery. However, given current satellite coverage, a conservative estimate is that 9,987 ha (~40%) from within the elevational range of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
have either been completely deforested or constitute young regrowth or unviable forest fragments surrounded by clearings. This would leave only 15,084 ha of more or less undisturbed primary or older secondary forest. Recent observations indicate, however, that this extent of forest loss is probably an underestimate. After the first discovery of this species and a number of other new bird taxa on Peleng (

49

), the island became a destination for an average of 1-3 international adventure and birdwatching tour groups per year, which considerably helped spur the local economy of the village near the type locality (name withheld). While this sort of ecotourism has a positive impact on the natural environment in many reported cases, on Peleng the sudden influx of tourist dollars led to observations of increased logging and expansion of infrastructure, prompting the rapid destruction of forest at the original type locality over the last five years. In the near future, it will be of paramount importance for the survival of Peleng’s unique montane fauna to find ways in which the influx of eco-tourism dollars can create incentives for conservation.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
Based on its plumage coloration, the new species is clearly a member of the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, hitherto known from Sulawesi and the Sula Archipelago (

57

). The discovery of a new constituent of this radiation on the Banggai Archipelago closes the geographic gap between Sulawesi and Sula. Most previous taxonomic treatises (e.g. 
6 1, 7 5
) have regarded all members of this radiation as conspecific, and indeed plumage differences are relatively minor and have long been interpreted as consistent with a subspecific treatment. However, recent research into patterns of bioacoustic and genomic differentiation among rusty-bellied fantails from Sulawesi, Sula and Banggai has produced strong evidence in favor of species level treatment of all three island populations (
7 2
).

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="biology_ecology">
            <p>
Vocalizations
: Bioacoustically, the courtship vocalization (=song) of the new species from Peleng is the most distinct of any member of the radiation. A detailed characterization of this song has been published elsewhere (

49

). In fact, when we first found the species in the field, the bird stood out through its unusual, simple descending song that lacks the typical complex tinkling quality of its congeners (

49

). Quantitative bioacoustic comparisons revealed that the unusual vocal features of the new Peleng species have led to an acoustic leapfrog pattern in rusty-bellied fantails in which the two terminal (=easternmost and westernmost) species (i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) are more similar to each other in courtship vocalizations but are geographically divided by the new species with its unusual song (
7 2
). The great vocal distinctness of the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
is surprising because it belies its geographic proximity to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
(Sulawesi)
</tp:taxon-name>
across a combined lowland and sea gap of less than 40km and its frequent land connection to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
(Taliabu)
</tp:taxon-name>
across Pleistocene land bridges during times of global cooling (

49

). Vocal behavior is known to be an important feature in species cohesion and reproductive isolation in songbirds (
7 6, 77
), and has been shown to be more important as an indicator of species limits than plumage traits in some passerine lineages (

78

). Therefore, recent authors have accepted the unmistakable vocal uniqueness of the new Peleng fantail as an indication of its status as an undescribed new species (
57, 7 2
).

Genomic data
: In a previously published analysis (
7 2
), we conducted a comparison of&gt;11,000 genome-wide markers with a complete representation among 16 individuals spanning all three species within the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. In this analysis, the new species from Peleng emerged as most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (both subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
toradja
) and less closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sula. This phylogenomic result is significant considering that – among all pairwise vocal comparisons – the greatest bioacoustic differentiation is found between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and the new species, with strong vocal distinctions in both non-courtship vocalizations and courtship songs (
7 2
). Therefore, the relatively shallowest genomic differentiation among the three island populations corresponds to the deepest bioacoustic divergence.
</p>
            <p>
Although the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
emerged as most closely related within the radiation, comparisons of genome-wide data allow for the designation of both taxa as independent species: the basal split between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other taxa is mainly based on a genomic signal contained in ~20% of the genetic variance across study loci, whereas the second most dominant genomic signature – contained in ~14% of the genetic variance across markers – predominantly represents the deep divergence between the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
[

in (
7 2
)]. The presence of a significant proportion of genomic locus cohorts displaying deep differentiation between the new species and either of its two neighbors was in agreement with gene flow analyses (‘ABBA-BABA tests’) that pointed to a history of rare introgression between the new species and its neighbors (
7 2
), perhaps during episodes of unusual climate forcing dispersal between islands. Such secondary introgression is not unusual among congeneric bird species (

79

) and is not in conflict with species level treatment.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>
The entire crown from forehead to nape is rich earthen-brown (7.5YR 3/3) with slightly darker feather margins creating a scalloped appearance. A thin off-white supercilium is pronounced from bill base to just behind eye, from where it slowly tapers out. Lores are dark brownish-black (2.5Y 1.5/1). Ear coverts are of a medium earthen-brown tone (5YR 3/1) with fine pale shaft streaks giving a grizzled appearance, grading into a more greyish-brown tone (10YR 6/1) in the moustachial and malar region. The mantle and scapulars down to the uppertail coverts are largely concolorous with the crown but lack the scalloping created by darker feather margins. The remiges are mostly a rich cold dark-brown (2.5YR 2/1) but have warmer outer webs concolorous with mantle. The upperwing coverts are similarly two-toned, being mostly concolorous with mantle but some showing darker outer webs concolorous with most of remiges. As typical for the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
, the rectrices are narrow and dark- brown, very close in color to the remiges (2.5YR 2/1). The tail feathers are mostly worn, although one in the centre appears to be a new replacement.
</p>
            <p>The white chin and throat are quite sharply demarcated from the face. The lower throat and upper breast, still white, are interspersed with fine dusky speckling increasing towards the breast and lower throat sides where the color grades into a solid mid-grey (N5) with only few inconspicuous dusky speckles. The grey breast color then grades into a tawny- ochraceous belly color (7.5YR 4/6), first through tracts of grey feathers which have warm- ochraceous edging, then through tracts of largely ochraceous feathers that still have a grey feather centre, eventually to all-ochraceous feathers. The belly color becomes darker and richer on the undertail coverts and flanks (7.5YR 3/4).</p>
            <p>The bill is black with an inconspicuous paler tip. The gape on the live bird was slightly enlarged light yellow. The iris is dark brown. The tarsus and toes were described on the live bird as maroon-horn with paler, more yellowish toepads.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A rich dark-brown forest warbler typical of the montane resident 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. As is usual across this cryptic genus, the new taxon is most conspicuous not on the basis of its plumage but its vocalizations.
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, it is most similar in size and shape to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
of Sulawesi. However, in comparison to the new taxon, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
has less distinct speckling on the breast, has a more uniform crown that is less scalloped, paler and warmer brown upperparts, greyer underparts with brown mostly only on flanks, and has a less pointed, wider tail.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram differs in its less distinct central breast spotting, greyer (less whitish) supercilium, and more extensive grey on breast reaching further onto upper breast, neck sides and auriculars.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru differs in its much whiter breast, with off-white reaching onto mid-belly, whereas only the lower flanks and lower belly are warm-brown. Although the central breast of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
has a mid-grey tinge, its underparts are much paler than the new species’ fairly uniform grey lower breast, which grades into a fairly dark homogeneous warm-brown belly.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is quite different from the smaller 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. montis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Java. The latter is much paler cinnamon-brown on upperparts, crown and especially remiges and rectrices, and is uniformly buff-white below with extensive dark-brown speckling from chin to upper belly, lacking the new species’ grey tones on the breast and dark warm-brown tones on the belly.

            <p>
The name 
<tp:taxon-name>
portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
– past participle of Latin ‘portendere’ – roughly translates as “the predicted one” or “the foretold one” and relates to the unusual circumstances of discovery when FER first heard the new warbler and recognized it to be a novel species of

multiple days before a visual confirmation was obtained.

</p>
            <p>Currently only one adult specimen is available (i.e., the holotype), and photos of up to two more adults suggest that this is probably a sexually monomorphic species with limited plumage variation.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
FER was the first person to discover 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on 9 April 2009 near its type locality when he heard an unmistakable insect-like sound that he attributed to a hitherto unnamed taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
grasshopper-warbler. Having been exposed to the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on a visit to Sulawesi only two weeks prior, and having had previous field experience with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru and Seram, respectively (
8 0
), FER was aware that the song of this population – albeit superficially reminiscent of the others – is distinct at the species level. Even so, because of the retiring nature of this bird and ill-timed heavy rain, it took FER another two hiking expeditions to the highlands of Taliabu to finally confirm on 15 April 2009 that this song was indeed uttered by what he perceived as an “unusually dark” individual of grasshopper-warbler (

48

). We encountered this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected a single specimen, now the holotype.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is presumably restricted to montane forest at the highest elevations of the island of Taliabu (

19
, 
48

) (

). All our records are from elevations above 1,050m on the more mountainous western half of the island of Taliabu, which reaches its highest altitude of ~1,415m at an unnamed peak near our collection locality (

). The new species inhabits a peculiar type of dwarf montane forest typical of these elevations.
</p>
            <p>
The occurrence of the new species on neighboring islands is highly doubtful. Of the three major islands that form the Sula archipelago, Taliabu is the largest and tallest. The smallest main island, Sanana, barely reaches above 600m elevation. The highest elevation on its larger neighbor Mangole is 1,127m – theoretically within the elevational range of this grasshopper-warbler – but the area of land above 1,050m on Mangole is only ~36 ha, which is too small an area to allow for the survival of a highly montane bird species throughout evolutionary time scales. On the neighboring Banggai archipelago, the situation is similar: the only island high enough to allow for the theoretical possibility of grasshopper-warbler breeding occurrence is Peleng (highest elevation ~1,022m), but extensive fieldwork around this highest area has not revealed the presence of any resident grasshopper-warblers (

19
, 
49

).
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
must be a rare bird: Taliabu’s area above 1,050m amounts to ~16,690 ha of formerly forested land in the interior of the island’s western half, over 97% of which forms one contiguous block (

). However, satellite imagery predominantly from 2004 indicates that a total of ~1,023 ha (~6.1%) of this area had been affected by logging operations that have degraded the forest and removed its undercover, presumably rendering the affected areas unsuitable, or nearly so, for the grasshopper-warbler. In the one-and-a-half decades since the satellite images were obtained, extensive additional logging is likely to have occurred. Another 940 ha (~5.6%) of the area above 1,050m have succumbed to a series of catastrophic forest fires in 1982 and 1983, and now constitute open grassland habitat unsuitable for this warbler (

). Our surveys showed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
does not occur in the extensive recently generated grasslands in the highlands of Taliabu (

48

). This leaves 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
with less than 15,000 ha of suitable habitat, an area likely to further diminish in size with ongoing habitat destruction and the impacts of global warming leading to an upward elevational shift of habitat zones.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We include this new taxon within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
following the phylogenetic demonstration that the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bradypterus
</tp:taxon-name>
(previously used for this Southeast Asian clade of warblers) is restricted to Africa (
8 1, 8 2
). Its inclusion within 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
is the reason why we follow the recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] of using the English moniker ‘grasshopper-warbler’ rather than the term ‘bush-warbler’, which is more appropriately reserved for members of a radiation in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Cettiidae</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
is renowned for its cryptic and conservative coloration that has confounded plumage-based classifications for decades and led to delays in the recognition of species-level taxa until bioacoustic and molecular methods have been applied (
8 3, 8 4
). In Wallacea, members of a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from Sulawesi and the Moluccas were previously united into a single polytypic species 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
(
6 1, 7 5
), but have recently been divided into three constituent island species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru, on the basis of their strikingly different songs (

57

). Our new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is geographically surrounded by constituents of this radiation and is a member of it both on the basis of morphological characters (see Diagnosis) and bioacoustic ones.
</p>
            <p>
Although plumage distinctions are not as important in the genus, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by comparatively unique, dark-brown upperparts that stand in contrast to the generally paler and warmer-brown upperparts of neighboring species. However, we mainly attribute species status to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on the basis of its unique song and genetic differentiation. We here provide an excerpt of ongoing analyses as relating to the bioacoustic and mitogenomic differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>

from neighboring species.

Bioacoustic evidence
: A total of 41 suitable, high-quality, homologous 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
song recordings from the field were gathered for analysis from various sources, encompassing all three previous species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation plus the new species. These recordings were measured for 11 suitable bioacoustic parameters, and resultant measurements were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and a conservative vocal diagnosability criterion (

85

), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Further details regarding all analyzed recordings, such as GPS locations, dates, times, and names of recordists, are listed in table S3, while more details on bioacoustic methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
Based on the Isler Criterion, eight out of eleven song parameters measured were diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and two other taxa: 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (table S4). Four out of eleven parameters were Isler-diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (table S4). The ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) can be adopted to ascertain if the level of vocal divergence between these archipelagic taxa is comparable in magnitude to divergences across unequivocal species-level divisions. When comparing Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler song against that of the Friendly Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
, a geographically distant species from montane Borneo that has never been included in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, only two parameters emerged as Isler-diagnosable (table S4). Using this result as a yardstick for what constitutes species level vocal differentiation, the magnitude of vocal divergence between Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
on Seram, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
on Buru, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on Sulawesi is extremely high, indicating they all have diagnosably distinct vocalizations that are best reflected in species rank.
</p>
            <p>
Principal component analysis of the vocal measurements underscores the vocal distinctness of Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from the other three Wallacean species (

). A cumulative proportion of variance of 73.3% is accounted for in the first two principal components, suggesting a strong vocal differentiation between Taliabu and the remaining taxa (

).
</p>
            <p>
Mitogenomic evidence
: Using whole-genome sequencing and laboratory approaches for the use of ancient DNA, we created an alignment of whole-mitochondrial sequences spanning ~15,000 base pairs (bp) across 11 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals belonging to all four constituent island forms of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, and used three different phylogenetic tree-building methodologies to investigate relationships and levels of divergence. More details on the methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
All three phylogenetic trees produced indicated identical topologies with high bootstrap support (

), suggesting that the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is an independent lineage most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (mitogenomic divergence ~2%), and much more distantly related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (divergence ~4.8–5%) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (divergence ~7.7–8%). Mitogenomic divergences roughly correlate with those from the COI barcoding gene, although they do not have to be equal in magnitude.
</p>
            <p>
Integrating the vocal and mitogenomic evidence, it is clear that bioacoustic differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, the two species which emerged most closely related on the mitogenomic tree (

), far exceed those between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and a geographically distant species (
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
) that has never been closely associated with the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. Our combined evidence therefore supports the treatment of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
as a well-diverged small-insular endemic species.

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic sampling:
We obtained 41 homologous recordings, which were either recorded by us in the field, or privately sourced from avid field ornithologists (including Robert O. Hutchinson and Ross Gallardy), or collected from publicly accessible online databases, namely the Avian Vocalization Center (AVoCet at http://avocet. integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu), the Xeno-Canto Sound Library (www.xeno-canto.org), the Macaulay Sound Library (www.macaulaylibrary.org), and the Internet Bird Collection (www.hbw.com/ibc).
</p>
            <p>Although slight variation in recording quality exists in the equipment used, inspection and comparison of spectrograms from different devices showed that this variation is comparable to that amongst recordings made by one sole recordist using the same device. In addition, although there is some variability in background noise, spectrogram inspection suggested that measurements of vocalizations would not be affected. Measurements of the recordings were performed using the program Raven Pro Version 1.5 (Bioacoustics Research Program, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA) on its default settings. The following eleven parameters were chosen for bioacoustic analysis, with each parameter averaged over all the measurements across one recording:</p>
            <p>1. Total number of elements per motif (with an element being a syllable represented by a trace on the spectrogram, and a motif being a collection of elements always repeated together)</p>
            <p>2. Number of introductory elements per motif (with introductory elements being brief, truncated, and usually fainter elements preceding the main body of the song)</p>
            <p>
3. Number of main elements per motif (with main elements taking up the bulk of the song, in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
typically in the form of shrill, insect-like trills)
</p>
            <p>4. Total duration of a motif</p>
            <p>5. Total duration of introductory elements</p>
            <p>6. Total duration of main elements</p>
            <p>7. Duration of break between introductory and main elements</p>
            <p>8. Minimum frequency of a motif</p>
            <p>9. Maximum frequency of a motif</p>
            <p>10. Bandwidth (i.e., maximum minus minimum frequency)</p>
            <p>11. Peak frequency of a motif (i.e., the frequency at which the amplitude of the sound is</p>
            <p>highest)</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic analysis:
The vocal diagnosability criterion outlined by Isler et al. (
8 5
), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, was used to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Besides other oscine passerines (
73, 8 6
), this criterion has been employed as a bioacoustic species delimitation method across Asian birds such as owls (

58
, 
87

), pigeons (

50
, 
52
, 
88

), and nightjars (

89

). The Isler criterion has two parts which must be fulfilled in order to infer diagnosability. Firstly, the range of measurements of a parameter between two taxa must not exhibit overlap, and secondly, the data have to satisfy the following equation: 
xa
+ 
taSDa ≤xb–tbSDb,
where (
x
) refers to the respective means of measurements in taxon a and b, and 
ti
refers to the t-score at the 95th percentile of the t distribution for 
n-1
degrees of freedom. This is a stricter statistical test than the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (
8 5
) as it employs the standard deviation of the sample points instead of the taxon mean, allowing for the diagnosis of distinctions between taxa under more rigorous conditions. Successful Isler diagnosability is defined here as the presence of at least one vocally diagnostic parameter between taxa.

DNA extraction methods:
Fresh tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
was DNA- sequenced along with the following number of toepad scrapings of historical museum specimens: three of the Buru Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, three of the Seram Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and four of the Sulawesi Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
. All museum samples had been kindly contributed by the American Museum of Natural History (for voucher numbers, see 

and table S5). DNA extraction was carried out with the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extraction of the historic museum specimens’ toepad scrapings was conducted by trained personnel (CYG) in a room dedicated to ancient DNA extraction to preclude DNA contamination. The toepads were rinsed with water four times before extraction to ensure preservatives were removed, and DTT was added to facilitate digestion of keratin present in toepads. The concentrations of the DNA extracts were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay.
</p>
            <p>
DNA sequencing methods:
The holotype’s DNA extract was sheared into smaller fragments of ~250 base pairs (bp) using 13 cycles of 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off on a Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode, USA). Whole-genome library preparation for the holotype was carried out using a NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, USA) for Illumina according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the museum toepad extracts, the shearing step was omitted as the ancient DNA is already degraded and NEBNext FFPE DNA repair mix (New England Biolabs, USA) was added to each ancient DNA sample prior to library preparation to fix damage common to degraded DNA such as deamination, nicks and gaps. In addition, size selection of library preparation products was omitted for the toepad samples to reduce DNA loss from bead selection. A total of five PCR cycles were run on the holotype’s DNA extract and 12 PCR cycles on the toepads’ extracts. Whole-genome library preparation of toepad samples was carried out in a room with a PCR hood dedicated to ancient library preparation work. The concentrations and peak fragment sizes of the libraries were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay and an Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer (Agilent, USA), respectively. The peak fragment sizes of the historic museum samples and the fresh holotype (including adaptors and unique indexes) were ~230bp and ~380bp, respectively. All prepared libraries were sent to NovogeneAIT Genomics Singapore for Illumina sequencing using a HiSeq 4000 platform to produce 150bp paired-end reads.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial genome alignment
: Trimmomatic (version 0.33) (

90

) was used to remove adaptors and filter low quality reads (below 15 Phred quality score). We applied the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (version 0.7.15-r1140) (
9 1
) to align reads to a mitochondrial reference genome, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella pryeri
</tp:taxon-name>
(Genbank accession no.: NC_029151), with a minimum mapping quality score of 30. Samtools (version 1.9) (
9 2, 9 3
) was run to convert the SAM output files from the alignment to a BAM format for downstream analysis. Then Picard (version 2.18.21; http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) was employed to insert read groups and remove PCR duplicate artifacts. The BAM files were then imported into CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0.4 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com) for remapping to the same reference genome using the following mapping parameters: mismatch penalty of 1, insertion penalty of 1, and deletion penalty of 1. The reads were locally realigned at indel regions, and the consensus sequences were extracted at a minimum coverage threshold of 100. A mapping summary produced by Qualimap (version 2.2.1) (
9 4
) indicated that our mitochondrial genome coverage ranged between ~290–2920x for museum samples and ~6430x for the holotype (table S5). Sequences are deposited with GenBank at accession numbers 
MN597052
- 
MN597062
.
</p>
            <p>
Phylogenetic analysis
: The consensus sequences were exported in FASTA format and visually realigned in MEGA7 (

95

), producing a final whole-mitochondrial alignment of ~15,000bp. MEGA7 was used to construct a neighbor-joining tree based on uncorrected p- divergences and a maximum parsimony tree. Additionally, we ran raxmlGUI 1.5 beta (

96

) to construct a maximum likelihood tree using the GTRGAMMA model as specified by jModelTest (version 2.1.7) (

97

). All tree-building analyses were conducted with 10,000 bootstrap replicates. Pairwise uncorrected p-divergences across the mitogenomic alignment were calculated in MEGA7 with 10,000 bootstrap replicates.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Head and mantle down to uppertail coverts and to central belly are bright scarlet-red (7.5R 4/14) with subtle blackish suffusion owing to individual feathers having broad red distal half followed by black and then increasingly greyish basal half; jet-black narrow orbital ring and loral line. Upperwings, sides of mantle, scapulars and rectrices are matt black, with the remiges appearing slightly duskier black because of narrow olive edging to outer webs; underwing coverts and outer webs of the underside of remiges are whitish; a blackish-grey (N1.5) wedge extends from vent up to central belly.

The diagnosis refers to the adult male plumage only. Female 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals of the Wallacean radiation are generally very similar across species, and more research is needed to identify good distinguishing marks.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is an obvious, bright scarlet-and-black representative of the Wallacean grouping of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters that have often been united within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
complex (
6 1, 7 5
), but have been considered a radiation of independent species by more recent authors [e.g. (

57

)]. Within this radiation, the new species most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species has a more extensive and brighter red body and blacker wings, scapulars, and tail. Scarlet feathers in the new species are mostly black and grey at the base, with only the distal half scarlet, and with a sharp contrast between scarlet and black, lacking 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
’s narrow yellow bands in between the red and black portions of each individual feather that render the latter’s overall body more orange-tinted. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the red is not as extensive on the underparts, and the abdomen and vent are paler buff-white versus blackish-grey in the new species.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species is paler and greyer (not black) on vent and abdomen. It also has a smudgier scarlet body coloration (caused by the black and grey basal halves of individual feathers), with dark smudges especially pronounced on face and on breast sides, as compared to more uniform red underparts, head and mantle in 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
. Black lores in the new species are wider and not as clearly delimited as in 
<tp:taxon-name>

.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis

Etymology

</p>
            <p>We name this species after the village of Wahe (1.716°S, 124.843°E), which is the gateway to the highest elevations on Taliabu where it most commonly occurs. The species epithet is an indeclinable noun in apposition.</p>

Individual, age-related and sexual variation within taxon

</p>
            <p>
Two adult male specimens (holotype and 34.356) are virtually identical in coloration. Two additional male specimens (34.373 and 34.403), most likely immatures, are similar but have the scarlet body color replaced with a more rose-red hue (5R 4/14); they also do not exhibit any distinct olive margins of remiges. No comparative specimen material exists for adult females of the new species, which are generally similar among all regional 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species. Photos confirm that the female of the new species resembles other regional species (data not shown). One juvenile specimen (34.407) lacks red coloration and is generally drab grayish-brown (paler on underparts), becoming more intense earthen-brown on the mantle, rump and upperwing coverts, with the underside of remiges and rectrices mid-grey.

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
was first spotted by a University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 led by P.J. Davidson. Participants of this exploratory survey were probably the first ornithologists to visit the highlands of Taliabu between 600-800 m elevation (
64, 9 8
), where they found the new species predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m). FER then encountered the species commonly during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu between 4-18 April 2009 (

19
, 
48

), where we returned between 6-16 December 2013 to collect the holotype and accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has thus far only been found on the island of Taliabu within the Sula Archipelago. On Taliabu, we have recorded it from sea level to 1,300m (

19
, 
48

), and it presumably occurs further up all the way to the highest elevation at ~1,415m. The species inhabits forest canopy and edge habitat, and is a nectarivore and frugivore that has been photographed feeding at flowers (

48

). Akin to multiple other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species in Wallacea (

57

), the new species is seen far more often at higher elevations (roughly above ~800m) than in the lowlands. Davidson et al. (

64

), who first sighted this species, exclusively found it at higher elevations, mostly around ~800m, and we recorded it as “abundant” above 800m, whereas we have only had a handful of sightings in the lowlands. It is unknown to what extent elevational differences in abundance reflect the difficulty of detecting a canopy bird in tall lowland forest as compared to stunted montane forest. However, although detection difficulties may help mask its true abundance in the lowlands, we do not believe it is possible for the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
to be equally common across elevations given that other small canopy birds do not escape detection in the lowlands and are recorded commonly. In fact, the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
may even be a breeding endemic to montane elevations and only venture into the lowlands seasonally, following tree flowering and fruiting events. This potential seasonal displacement would explain why some expeditions have completely overlooked it in the lowlands while others have recorded it on occasion.
</p>
            <p>
It is contentious whether the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
is endemic to Taliabu, or also occurs on the other two main islands of the Sula Archipelago (Mangole and Sanana). The latter two have received even less ornithological attention than Taliabu, and to the best of our knowledge, the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has never been recorded there on recent ornithological expeditions (D. Yong, pers. comm.; J.A. Eaton, pers. comm.). Sanana is relatively low-lying (up to ~600m) and therefore likely to lack a number of Taliabu’s montane species. Mangole reaches its highest peak at 1,127m, but areas above 800m are confined to ~328 ha only, which gives it a comparatively small area of true montane forest. The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
’s level of dependence on vegetation at high elevations probably determines whether it would be capable of occurring on Mangole or even Sanana. Future fieldwork on those two islands will shed light on whether the new species occurs there or not.
</p>
            <p>
FER and Filip Verbelen first discovered a new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
population in the mountains of Peleng in the neighboring Banggai Archipelago during a visit between 23-30 March 2009 and recorded it as reasonably common at elevations between 700-900m in the western Peleng highlands (

49

). On our collecting expedition, we only had one aural encounter of this 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
on Peleng on 21 Dec 2013, indicating that the population might have been seasonally displaced or more retiring (

19

). However, photographic evidence from the 2009 visit indicates that the Peleng population has a plumage coloration that is very similar – if not identical – to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and quite different from 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
. As this Peleng population remains uncollected, future fieldwork will hopefully produce specimens allowing a determination whether there are differences between the Peleng birds and 
<tp:taxon-name>

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu is obviously a member of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, which used to be considered a single wide-ranging polytypic species for a long time (
6 1, 7 5
), but has now been divided into multiple monotypic island endemics by most recent authors on the basis of extensive plumage differences [e.g. (
57, 8 0, 99
)]. Within this radiation, its plumage most closely resembles that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, but is discrete from both of them in multiple characters (see Diagnosis). Its morphological differences from both 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
exceed those between other closely related species pairs within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. dammermani
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
(

73

). Therefore, its diagnosis here as a species level taxon rests on Mayr and Ashlock’s (

70

) yardstick approach, by which species status is conferred on the basis of divergences that exceed those of species pairs in which biologically important differences have been unequivocally demonstrated.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters have a wide vocal repertoire that is oftentimes problematic in the context of bioacoustic analysis (

73

). The Taliabu 
<tp:taxon-name>Myzomela</tp:taxon-name>
was hardly vocal during our encounters, and we do not consider vocalizations a fruitful taxonomic avenue in delimiting this new species from others. Instead, we have generated mitochondrial sequence data to further shed light on the new species’ taxonomic status.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial evidence
: Our mitochondrial tree analysis was based on sequences of the coding gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), comparing 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
to a great majority of members of the eastern and central Indonesian radiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters. Results indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
is most closely related to geographically adjacent species such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (

). Our analysis does not provide resolution on whether either 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
constitute the sister species to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
, and in fact, the latter two may well be sister to each other instead (

), rendering 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
a more basal species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from adjacent Buru is not represented in our mitochondrial dataset, and likely forms part of this group. Based on plumage coloration, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
is frequently considered to constitute the sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, and the two are sometimes merged under one species [e.g. (

99

)]. Therefore, we assume that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
– albeit closely related – will probably not emerge as the direct sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
in future analyses.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial ND2 divergence values between 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
and its two most closely related relatives (

<tp:taxon-name>M. elisabethae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chloroptera</tp:taxon-name>

) range between 3.5%–4.3% (

), well above the mitochondrial divergence threshold of 2-3% widely postulated in the literature (
10 0, 10 1
), providing additional support for species level recognition of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial analysis:
We extracted DNA from the breast muscle tissue of all our 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
material (n = 5), and from four independently collected 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
samples (

73

), using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. ND2 was then sequenced following Lim et al. (
10 2
).
</p>

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>The crown (from forehead to nape) is cold brown (2.5Y 2/2), delimited below by a narrow long white supercilium from bill base to napeside. Lores dark greyish brown (2.5Y 3/1) extending to just behind eye in the form of an eyestripe cutting through a broken white eye ring formed by small feathers peripheral to the eye. Black rictal bristles. Ear coverts and malar, facial and moustachial regions show white-and-dusky grizzling. Most of upperparts, including mantle, scapulars and rump, are mid-olive (5Y 4/4), while remiges are distinctly darker-olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). The white chin and throat are characterized by sporadic dusky speckles and lemon streaks increasing towards the lower throat, and grading into a fully lemon to sulphur yellow breast and belly (5Y 9/12). The yellow on the breast and belly has an olive-mottled appearance because of olive feather tips (5Y 4/4), especially pronounced towards the flanks, and white feather bases, especially pronounced towards the abdomen. The vent is solid lemon-yellow (5Y8/7). Iris dark-brown; bill black. Tarsus, toes and claws pinkish-grey with toepads paler yellowish.</p>

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The new species name is derived from “suara merdu” in Bahasa Indonesia, translating as “melodious voice”, referring to the pleasing vocalizations of this bird that FER heard hours before the first individual was seen, allowing for predictions prior to visual confirmation that this would be a new

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
During a visit to the highlands of Peleng between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently encountered this species at elevations between 700-900m (

49

). When hiking up to these elevations for the first time and hearing the melodious warble of this taxon in the distance, its superficial vocal resemblance to other members of the Wallacean 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation prompted FER to predict that this would be a new leaf-warbler taxon long before they laid their eyes on it. Once they first saw it, it was noticeable for its unusual behavior of frequently climbing along larger branches and trunks of trees in the manner of a treecreeper (
<tp:taxon-name>
Certhia
</tp:taxon-name>
). On our collecting expedition to Peleng between 18-23 Dec 2013, the species was less commonly encountered (

19

), probably because of seasonality.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new leaf-warbler is restricted to the highland forests of western Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago at elevations above 700m, reaching the highest island altitude above 1000m (

). Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago must be in serious doubt because only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, of which only 5 ha of land lie above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. Beyond the Banggai Archipelago,

Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). Underparts from chin to vent are largely lemon to sulphur yellow, with white feather bases creating a more lemon-yellow hue on throat, breast and belly (7.5Y 8/8) and olive feather tips (5Y 4/4) generating a more olive- mottled appearance on flanks, while the undertail coverts are largely uniform lemon (5Y 9/12).</p>

from Taliabu differs strikingly from the newly described species from Peleng (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu

<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
(from eastern, southeastern and central Sulawesi) by its paler yellow underparts coloration caused by an arrangement in which most feathers are predominantly white with strong yellow edging (versus all-yellow feathers, often with olive edges, in eastern Sulawesi birds). The new species is very distinct from

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
A University of East Anglia expedition by Davidson et al. (

64

) was the first to find a resident population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers on Taliabu, which they encountered commonly in montane forest and which they considered to represent an undescribed taxon. Rheindt (

48

) then studied this leaf warbler during his visit between 4-18 April 2009, and we found them again during our expedition between 6-16 Dec 2 013 and collected two (

19

).

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>
Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new warbler inhabits disturbed and undisturbed montane forest on Taliabu from 700m up to probably the highest elevations above 1,400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). It may also occur on the large neighboring island of Mangole, which rises to 1,127m and should harbor enough area of montane forest habitat above 700m to sustain a population. However, a lack of fieldwork in the mountains of Mangole means that there is no information available on its montane avifauna. The smallest main constituent of the Sula Archipelago, the densely populated island of Sanana, is unlikely to sustain any 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers as it barely reaches above 600m, which seems to be too low for this species. The species is replaced on the Banggai Archipelago by the newly described 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
(see SM5), while 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
replace it in various parts of Sulawesi. Given its more relaxed elevational requirements and its tolerance for disturbed habitat, this species is probably not as immediately endangered as some of the other montane Taliabu avifauna.

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
)


</p>
            <p>
The leaf-warbler genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
constitutes a large Old World radiation of small passerines that is exceptionally well-studied in phylogenetic terms (
10 6-1 09
). Recent demonstrations of genus paraphyly in combination with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
[summarized in (
10 8
)] have prompted a variety of new generic treatments, including a division into two re-defined genera [
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
; see (

57

)], but we here follow the latest phylogenetic treatise that suggests a merger of all 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
into a single genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
10 8
).
</p>
            <p>
Despite the genus’s well-known evolutionary history, a sizeable sub-clade of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Australasian (including Indonesian) Archipelago has largely been omitted from modern molecular insights. Notable exceptions include the first-ever example of a new avian species description (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. rotiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) partly based on genome-wide DNA data from the Timor region (
11 0
). However, most island populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
in this region have been merged into a limited number of ‘wastebasket species’, e.g. Mountain Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trivirgatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and Island Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
, although vocal and plumage differences among them often far exceed those documented among the better- studied continental groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
8 0
). As a consequence, some modern treatments [e.g. (

57

)] have adopted a ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) in which pairwise plumage and vocal differences between archipelagic taxa that are comparable in magnitude to those between better-studied continental species pairs (or exceed them) are interpreted as being indicative of species status. In this way, a number of highly distinct island taxa have been elevated to species level, such as Buru Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. everetti
, Seram Leaf Warbler
</tp:taxon-name>
               <tp:taxon-name>
P. ceramensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[a treatment that had previously been suggested on the basis of vocal and plumage comparisons; see (

80

)], and a number of additional Wallacean taxa. Our description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
follows this framework of affording species rank to taxa when vocal and plumage characters indicate deeper divisions. We also bring genome-wide DNA data to bear on the taxonomic classification of these two new species. However, following the yardstick approach as applied under the Biological Species Concept, we believe that biological characters, especially bioacoustic ones, will be the most important indicators when conferring species status in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers.

Plumage evidence

<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
differ from each other and from surrounding taxa in a number of important traits (see Diagnosis for each taxon) which are far more salient than the plumage differences of often identical-looking species pairs on the Asian continent that are otherwise vocally and phylogenetically deeply diverged [e.g. the three members of the Arctic Warbler

has a contrastingly white throat and supercilium and a grey-and-white grizzled auricular patch where all other surrounding taxa are much more yellowish, rendering it instantly recognizable in large series of specimens. In contrast, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is superficially reminiscent of Sulawesi Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
in its overall more yellowish coloration, displaying a phenotypic leapfrog pattern that has been documented from the Taliabu-Peleng-Sulawesi island trio on multiple previous occasions (
50, 7 2
). However, this superficial resemblance notwithstanding, it has important distinctions in bare-parts coloration and overall pigmentation (see Diagnosis), apart from obvious vocal differences.

Bioacoustic evidence
: In bioacoustic terms, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by melodious jumbles of 1–1.5sec, mostly at 2000–6000 Hz, with short individual high notes between 5000–7000 Hz occasionally interspersed. Song motifs generally lack repetitive element sequences or trills (

). In contrast, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by 1.5–3sec strophes mostly between 2000–6500 Hz (typically of a wider frequency range than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
) that constitute a melodious jumble often followed by a final repetitive phrase, which can sometimes be omitted (

). In this respect, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is slightly more reminiscent of the East Sulawesi population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng (despite the geographic proximity of the latter two). The 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
population on Gunung Tumpu (East Sulawesi) is often characterized by strong repetitive series at a very broad frequency range (2500–7000 Hz), mostly preceded by a variable but simple melodious series of elements between 2000–5000 Hz and a brief nasal note separating this variable series from the repetitive series (

). Depending on the presence or absence of components, the song rendition (=motif) can be 1.5–4sec long. In summary, the songs of these three forms (

<tp:taxon-name>P. suaramerdu</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. emilsalimi</tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
), while highly variable, are predictably different and strongly indicative of species status when put into the context of song differences among other 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
species (

).

Genomic evidence
: We generated a set of ~4,100 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment spanning almost 3 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial cytochrome- 
b
(cyt- 
b
) sequences, to shed light on the differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in separate Methods paragraphs below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three taxa (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
from East Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population-genomic space based on ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (

). The main division according to genomic PCA occurred between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
versus the other two taxa (PC1 in 

). The same relationship was strongly reflected in maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of concatenated genome-wide sequence alignments of almost 3 million base pairs length as well as in maximum-parsimony (MP) analysis of a concatenated set of ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (topology 1 in 

). In contrast, mitochondrial cyt- 
b
gene analysis and species-tree inference of genome-wide SNPs recovered a topology in which 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
were strongly supported sister lineages, with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
being more basal (topology 2 in 

). Depths of uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence (as determined by cyt- 
b
distances) were comparatively low across all three leaf-warblers (0.7-1.6%; 

).
</p>
            <p>
In summary, our phylogenomic analyses demonstrated considerable incongruence among tree topologies, including a strong mito-nuclear discordance that calls into doubt the reliability of mitochondrial divergence values in this dataset. For instance, the deepest genomic divergence was detected between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other two species (PC1 in 

), whereas on mitochondrial cyt- 
b
evidence 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
displayed some of the most shallow divergences from the other taxa (

). The use of mitochondrial divergences in species delimitation suffers from multiple confounding biases (
79, 10 0, 10 1
), especially when dealing with complexes containing closely-allied allopatric taxa that have a propensity for secondary gene flow (
11 2-11 4
). The best explanatory hypothesis for the pronounced mito- nuclear discordance in this dataset is that occasional overwater dispersal followed by hybridization and gene flow may have led to the introgression of foreign alleles in one or the other species, obfuscating clean branching patterns. Gene flow during sporadic hybridization is known to artifactually reduce mitochondrial divergences, masking deeper levels of genomic differentiation (

79

). Hence, introgression can account for the presence of relatively low mitochondrial divergences in a group of species characterized by comparatively deep genomic divergences and pronounced levels of bioacoustic differentiation [(

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted DNA from the fresh muscle tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and the three specimens collected by us (including the holotype) of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
, along with one individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
that we had collected on Mt Tumpu on the eastern peninsula of Sulawesi (

19

). Additional tissue samples were obtained from the American Museum of Natural History, New York (AMNH): three samples of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
from South Sulawesi and an outgroup sample of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus pallescens
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Solomon Islands. The AMNH samples were only used for phylogenomic rooting. DNA extraction was performed using the Exgene Clinic SV kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul) following the manufacturer’s instructions. We eluted the DNA in two consecutive rounds of 100μl molecular grade water. We prepared double-digest restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing (ddRADSeq) libraries using the same protocol as Garg et al. (
11 5
) with EcoRI and MspI as restriction enzymes. We quantified DNA and library product concentrations using the Qubit 2.0 Broad Range DNA Assay (Invitrogen, California), and used a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Iowa) to perform final quality checks on the library product. The genomic libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform at the Singapore Center for Environmental Life Science Engineering. Filtering and demultiplexing of the genomic data in STACKS 1.34 followed the same general procedures as detailed by Ng et al. (
7 2
), and are the result of comprehensive trials using a wide variety of different parameters and settings at each step of the analysis. DNA data is deposited with Genbank at BioProject accession number PRJNA566263.
</p>
            <p>
SNP calling and genomic supermatrix generation:
Reference genome alignment was performed using BWA 0.7.12 (
9 1
) and samtools 0.1.19 (http://samtools.sourceforge.net) (
9 2, 9 3
) on the Greenish Warbler (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
) genome (
11 6
), the most closely related available full genome. We performed SNP calling in STACKS 1.34 as per Ng et al. (
7 2
). We required loci to be present across all individuals, and retained one random SNP per locus to exclude obviously linked SNP loci. Subsequently, we used PLINK 1.9 (
11 7
) and Bayescan 2.1 (
11 8
) to filter SNPs for linkage disequilibrium and signs of selection. Data format manipulation and conversions were performed with PGDSpider (
1 19
). The final filtered dataset totaled 4,104 SNPs. In addition, we created concatenated SNP datasets for each group for use in downstream maximum parsimony analysis.
</p>
            <p>
Following the procedures used by Ng et al. (
7 2
), we generated a concatenated read supermatrix without missing data using pyRAD (
12 0
). We stipulated a minimum required locus coverage of 20, and kept the clustering threshold within and between reads at the default of 0.88. The final concatenated read supermatrix amounted to 2,861,661 bp in length, generated from 19,985 loci.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial sequence generation:
We sequenced cyt- 
b
using the primers H16065 (
12 1
) and L14995 (
12 2
), with 40 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 72°C. We conducted PCR product cleanup with ExoSAP-IT 
®
and used the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) for cycle- sequencing. Sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer using capillary electrophoresis. We assembled cyt- 
b
sequences with CodonCode Aligner 4.1 and aligned them with ClustalW (
12 3
). The final cyt- 
b
alignment was 1,100bp long, indel- free and fully translatable. Mitochondrial sequences have been deposited with Genbank at accession numbers 
MN518858
- 
MN518862
.
</p>
            <p>
Population structure inference:
In order to test for the presence of geographic structuring across East Sulawesi, Peleng, and Taliabu, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the genomic SNP data. PCA was performed using ade4 (
12 4
) and factoextra (
12 5
), both available as R packages (
12 6
).
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial tree inference:
We constructed phylogenetic cyt- 
b
trees using two methods: maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML). We ran MP analyses using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
), performing 10,000 bootstrap replicates. For ML analyses, we first used jModelTest v2.1.6 (

97

) and determined that the Jukes-Cantor model (
12 8
) was the best performing substitution model. We then ran RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) using the extensive subtree-pruning-regrafting tree search algorithm.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic tree inference:
We applied three different genomic tree inference analyses: coalescent-based species tree inference (applied to the SNP dataset), maximum likelihood tree inference (applied to concatenated read supermatrix), and maximum parsimony tree inference (applied to the concatenated SNP dataset). We performed species tree inference using SNAPP (
1 29
) as implemented in BEAST 2.3.0, performing two iterations using default settings. Tracer 1.6 was used after each iteration to ensure that the runs had reached convergence, after which LogCombiner v2.3.0 and DensiTree (
13 0
) were used to process results. We carried out ML tree inference using RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) on the concatenated read supermatrix using the general-time-reversible gamma-invariant (GTRGAMMA) model and performed 1,000 rapid bootstrap searches. Finally, we conducted conventional MP analysis on the concatenated SNPs of each taxon set, using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
) and running 10,000 bootstrap replicates to evaluate branch support.

            <p>Crown bright rufous (7.5YR 6/10) from nape to forehead, including single rows of feathers below the eye. Posterior auriculars are mid-brown (7.5YR 3.5/3) grading into a pale orange- rufescent (7.5YR 7/6) frontwards towards the malar and moustachial regions. Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts are bronzy olive (2.5Y 3/4), the remiges and rectrices slightly darker and with more coppery edging (10YR 4/6). Dull white on breast reaches to chin, with an orange-rufescent tinge (7.5YR 7/6) surrounding the breast laterally and ventrally. Yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, with a rufescent-orange suffusion to flanks (7.5YR 7/6). Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Dark-horn mandible. Yellow-orange tarsus on live bird.

One of the phenotypically most distinct subspecies of the Mountain Tailorbird or Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Uniquely among all subspecies, the new taxon has a rufescent suffusion on throat and breast, becoming especially pronounced on breast sides and auriculars (from where it grades into the rufous crown), rendering the bird’s anterior aspect much warmer-tinged than all other subspecies. The upperparts, especially upper wings, are also warmer bronzy and the flanks tinged more rufescent than all other subspecies, making this the most reddish-looking taxon in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. It additionally differs from most other subspecies (except those from Sulawesi and Peleng) in the rufous crown’s more posterior extension to the nape and in the absence of a pale supercilium.
</p>
            <p>
It further differs from

cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis

malayanus
(Malay Peninsula) and all subspecies further to the north and west in the absence of a strong grey hindcollar band and/or strongly grey breast sides. In many aspects, the new taxon is similar to the set of subspecies on Sulawesi (
riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow on belly and lower breast (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near- complete absence of yellow, respectively). For additional differences from the new subspecies on Peleng, see SM8.

            <p>
Davidson et al. (

<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoiler (then called an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird) for Taliabu, and characterized the population as inhabiting montane forest above 500m and possibly in need of taxonomic description. FER found this population commonly in disturbed montane forest to over 1,100 m, with a few records in dense secondary bamboo thickets down to 50m (

48

), and our collecting expedition re-encountered this form abundantly at elevations around 1,300m (

19

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, this new subspecies is currently only known from Taliabu in the Sula Archipelago. There, it inhabits disturbed situations (forest edge, bamboo thickets) mostly in the mountains, with the highest record at 1300m, but presumably ranging to the highest point at over 1400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). On other islands, mountain leaftoilers rarely range lower than ~500m (

57

), but Rheindt (

48

) exceptionally recorded the new taxon on Taliabu from an extensive bamboo thicket at ~50m, demonstrating that this population may tolerate lower elevations. The presence of this leaftoiler on the other two main Sula islands, Mangole and Sanana, is likely, especially on the former, which rises to over 1,100m, but perhaps also on the latter, which reaches to a little over 600m. However, it has probably been overlooked owing to a lack of fieldwork at higher elevations on these two islands. On the Banggai Archipelago, the species is represented by another novel subspecies (see below) that replaces 
sulanus
there. Its predilection for disturbed forest situations and wide elevational tolerance as compared to other insular mountain birds probably means that it is currently not of conservation concern.

Crown and nape rich rufous (2.5YR 4/10), slightly darker posteriorly, and not extending as far onto the nape as in the new Taliabu subspecies (
P. c. sulanus
; see SM7). Short blackish eyestripe. Facial region from auriculars to lores dusky-grey (N3) with an increasing rufous suffusion (concolorous with crown) towards the malar and moustachial regions. Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts olive with a slight bronzy hue (5Y 3/4), colder-colored than in the new subspecies from Taliabu (
P. c. sulanus
). Remiges and rectrices are darker and duskier, but with outer edging nearly concolorous with mantle. Underparts are bicolored, with a white chin to breast, and a lemon-yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, and with a dusky olive suffusion on the flanks. Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Tarsus dark-yellow. On the live bird, the upper mandible was black with a yellow tip, and the lower mandible was black with a yellow base and tip. The iris color was not clearly discerned on the live bird.

            <p>
A distinct new subspecies of Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(or ‘Mountain Tailorbird’), differing from adjacent subspecies to the east and to the west in important discrete characters.
</p>
            <p>
The lack of a supercilium and the posterior extension of the rufous crown coloration onto the mid-nape set this subspecies apart from most other subspecies, except those from Sulawesi and Taliabu, which have an equally or sometimes even slightly more extensive rufous crown. It further differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis
(Borneo), 
malayanus
(Malay Peninsula) and all subspecies further west and north in the absence of a strong grey hindcollar band and/or strongly grey breast sides; from 
<tp:taxon-name>
batjanensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(Bacan Island) in its lemon-yellow belly lacking a strong olive suffusion; and from 
dumasi
(Seram and Buru) in its much less brown-colored upperparts. In many aspects, the new taxon is similar to the set of subspecies on Sulawesi (
riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow belly (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near-complete absence of yellow, respectively).
</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies shares many unique traits with the new subspecies from Taliabu 
sulanus
(see SM7), but differs significantly in its darker chestnut crown and its less reddish overall appearance, largely lacking a rufescent suffusion to the breast and flanks, and showing much less rufescent on the auriculars; its flanks are also much colder olive-washed (versus warmly rufescent-washed), and the upperparts and especially upper wings are colder bronze-olive. On live birds, the legs are much darker and less intensely colorful than those of birds from Taliabu.

leaftoilers, this new taxon is restricted to forest edge situations, treefall gaps and bamboo thickets in montane forest on the island of Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago. During our combined visits to the island (

19
, 
49

), we recorded this new taxon from 750m to the highest point at over 1000m elevation. It may, therefore, not range as low as the new taxon from neighboring Taliabu, although future fieldwork may well produce lower elevational records. Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago is unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new subspecies. Despite its very small range, its predilection for disturbed forest situations probably means that it is not particularly negatively affected by the current degradation that is impacting most highland forests of western Peleng.

Taxonomic rationale (combined for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus sulanus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
P. c. relictus
)


</p>
            <p>
The Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
was previously thought to be an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird and then called Mountain Tailorbird. We here acknowledge the distant relationship to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbirds (
13 1
) and therefore follow the recent trend of calling members of this species ‘leaftoilers’ rather than tailorbirds [e.g. (

57

)], a fitting translation from their re- instated scientific genus name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
. As for the species name 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, we follow the recently proposed emendation (

6

) of the original spelling of the name (‘ 
cuculatus’
) on the basis of information in the original description showing that the name was meant to refer to the birds’ hooded appearance (from Latin cucullus – hood).
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: The new subspecies 
sulanus
from Taliabu is arguably one of the most distinctly-colored, if not the single most distinctly-colored subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(see Diagnosis) and is therefore well-deserving of subspecies status. Its reddish-suffused anterior body renders it instantly recognizable among any series of specimens. Although not as unique in morphology, we also describe 
relictus
from Peleng at the subspecific level mainly on the basis of its distinct coloration. In plumage distinctness, 
relictus
far exceeds several other previously recognized subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, such as 
P. c. cinereicollis
.
</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic evidence
: We have been unsuccessful in procuring a sufficiently large sample set of song recordings of the two new subspecies, precluding rigorous bioacoustic analysis. However, we note that the songs given by these two subspecies in the field did not strike us as very different from the songs of other subspecies we are familiar with. Song playback with recordings from several other islands elicited a ready response at least in 
P. c. relictus
. Based on our bioacoustic experience with Indonesian passerines, we do not have the impression that song differences of the two new subspecies would warrant anything but a subspecific treatment at the present time.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic evidence
: We created a set of ~8,500 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment of over 2 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase intron 2 (ND2) sequences, to investigate levels of differentiation among 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in a separate Methods paragraph below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three subspecies (
P. c. stentor
from eastern Sulawesi, 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng and 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population- genomic space (

). The main genomic division according to a PCA based on ~8,500 SNPs occurred between 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu versus the other two subspecies (PC1 in 

). In contrast to the leaf-warbler analysis (see SM6), this main genomic division among leaftoilers was also supported by the mitochondrial tree and the genomic ‘species tree’ (

), consistently placing 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng close to 
P. c. stentor
from Sulawesi, although the concatenated tree built from genome-wide loci was in conflict, placing 
P. c. relictus
closer to 
P. c. sulanus
. Coincidentally, the majority tree with a basal placement of 
sulanus
(topology 1 in 

) is also the arrangement that would be supported by the extraordinarily divergent plumage of 
sulanus
, making it unique among all leaftoiler subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
Pairwise divergences between the subspecies (as determined by ND2 distances) were relatively low (0.3-1.7%; 

), at levels generally accepted to be below the species threshold for birds [(~2-3%; (
100, 10 1
)], consistent with the current proposed subspecies status. These ND2 divergences further supported the majority tree (topology 1 in 

) by consistently rendering 
P. c. sulanus
as the most deeply diverged subspecies (up to ~1.7%), whereas 
P. c. relictus
and 
P. c. stentor
emerged as only 0.3% diverged.
</p>
            <p>
In summary, mitochondrial sequence analysis, PCA of genome-wide SNPs and ‘species-tree’ analysis all agree in placing 
P. c. sulanus
basal to the other two subspecies, an arrangement supported by its distinct plumage. Therefore, we have no reason to suspect bias in the mitochondrial divergence depth (unlike in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
, see SM6), which supports our bioacoustic assessment that both 
relictus
and 
sulanus
are at the subspecies level. Future studies of the uniquely colored 
P. c. sulanus
may yet challenge this assessment.
</p>
            <p>
Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted genomic DNA of all tissue material available for 
P. c. sulanus
(n=5) and 
P. c. relictus
(n=2), along with two samples of 
P. c. stentor
that we had independently collected on Mt Tumpu on the adjacent eastern Sulawesi peninsula (

19

). Tissue of a single individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cettia parens
</tp:taxon-name>
from Makira in the Solomon Islands, provided by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was also extracted to serve as an outgroup in phylogenomic rooting. Laboratory and analytical protocols followed our procedures outlined in SM6 (under 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
), utilizing the same reference genome (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
), but using a minimum stack depth of 5 in STACKS 1.34 and a minimum required locus coverage of 5 in pyRAD due to differences in sequencing quality. The final filtered dataset for the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers totaled 8,515 SNPs and the final concatenated read supermatrix was 2,002,726 bp long, generated from 13,194 separate loci. For mitochondrial analysis, we sequenced ND2 using the primers L5219Met and H6313Trp (
13 2
) with 35 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 50-53°C, but otherwise following the procedures as outlined in SM6. The final ND2 alignment for the leaftoilers was 1,015bp long, indel-free and fully translatable. All DNA data has been deposited with Genbank at accession number PRJNA566263 and 
MN518850

Hartert, 1920 (‘extremely neglected’) from Selayar Island, were based on the impression that the description of these birds had escaped the attention of researchers for too long. The presently described taxon, only discovered in the 21

century, fulfils that criterion even more adequately, so we take pleasure in naming it 
omississimus
(‘the most neglected’), superlative of ‘omissus’.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The immature plumage remains undocumented. The only two male specimens known to exist (holotype and MZB.Ornit.34.488) show minimal plumage variation, the only difference perhaps being the latter specimen’s slightly brighter, more brilliant rump and darker, more blackish tarsus and claws in life.</p>
            <p>As compared to males, the three female specimens have a duller blue supercilium (but still discernible), lack a black chin, have prominent rufous spectacles over a narrow blackish stripe through the cere, the rufous continuing to the lower sides of the face where it is finely speckled dark (in two of three females the speckling continues to the throat sides), and have much less dark blackish-blue auriculars, contrasting less with the rufous throat. The female’s upperparts are less brilliant blue. One of the three female specimens is slightly paler on the tarsus and claws.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new subspecies was first reported by Indrawan et al. (
13 3
), who documented the sighting of a female on 15 May 2001 and a male on 29 July 2001 at 50-100m elevation around Benteng on the main island of Togian, and pointed out that this new population may be an undescribed subspecies. Following their footsteps, Filip Verbelen (pers. comm.) made the first sound recordings of the new population in December 2008 when studying a few individuals on Kadidiri, a tiny forested tourist resort island off the coast of Togian measuring ~4km in length and less than 1km in width. A few days later, F. Verbelen moved to Batudaka, one of the three main islands of the archipelago, where he found additional individuals in coastal forest near the capital town of Wakai. FER visited Batudaka Island from 23-27 April 2009 and observed this new population. On our collecting trip, we visited Batudaka from 24-28 Dec 2013 and found this taxon to be common in the forests outside the capital town of Wakai, collecting the present material in the process (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>The new subspecies is known from the Togian Archipelago in the Gulf of Tomini, a satellite group of islands between the northern and eastern peninsulas of Sulawesi. More specifically, to the best of our knowledge the new subspecies has so far been found on the two main islands of Togian and Batudaka, as well as on the tiny islet of Kadidiri off Togian, where it is common in remnant forest and edge from near sea level to at least ~200m elevation. However, it is likely that the birds occur up to the highest elevations at ~430m on these islands. More field research is required to map this subspecies’ occurrence on other islands in this archipelago. Its presence on some of the larger, forest-covered islands in close proximity to Batudaka and Togian, such as Talatakoh, Waleakodi and Waleabahi, is virtually guaranteed, given its occurrence on tiny Kadidiri. However, its presence on slightly more distant islands, such as Puah (at ~18km from the main archipelago) and Unauna (at ~28km from the main archipelago) is less certain, although these latter islands are connected to the main archipelago by shallow sea-beds not exceeding 120m depth, indicating that they would have been connected with one another during glacial sea level recessions.</p>
            <p>
On the main island of Sulawesi, the newly described 
omississimus
is replaced by the nominate taxon 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Unusually, however, the nominate form on Sulawesi is a hill and montane forest denizen, occurring from 500-2300m elevation and shunning lowland forest habitats in stark contrast to the new subspecies.
</p>
            <p>The new subspecies appears to be moderately tolerant to habitat disturbance where small-scale timber extraction leads to a secondarization of primary forest. However, the taxon disappears where forest is converted into agricultural land. Although Togian’s forests are quickly dwindling, with most remnants by now secondary and restricted to inland locations away from the coast, far more than half of the islands should still be suitable for the new taxon, making it safe for the time being.</p>

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The proposed English name of this new taxon follows a recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] to call members of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
‘jungle-flycatchers’ rather than ‘blue-flycatchers’ because molecular data (
13 4
) and bioacoustic considerations (
57, 7 4
) strongly suggest a merger of many members of the previously recognized jungle-flycatcher genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinomyias
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Given that numerous species in the resultant genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
are no longer blue but entirely brown, the name ‘blue-flycatcher’, while formerly appropriate, is no longer suitable for this genus.
</p>
            <p>
Although distinguishable from other subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
in terms of plumage characters (see Diagnosis), 
omississimus
is quite similar to them in general coloration. At any rate, plumage coloration is not an ideal taxonomic indicator in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
jungle-flycatchers, many of which boast a highly conserved male plumage sporting blue upperparts and reddish underparts. Other characters, such as bioacoustic and genetic ones, may be more conducive to guiding taxonomic decision-making in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
We recently published a bioacoustic comparison on the basis of six vocal parameters among members of the greater 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, showing that the song of the newly described 
omississimus
from Togian exhibits considerable vocal overlap with the songs of all three analyzed subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
, while distinctly differing from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. kalaoensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[see 

in (
7 4
)]. This vocal evidence along with Togian’s proximity to Sulawesi suggest a placement of 
omississimus
as a subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Based on a lack of deep differentiation in both bioacoustic and genetic evidence, we propose to classify this new taxon at the subspecies level. Upon first discovery in the field, we were generally impressed by its lowland forest occurrence, which stands in contrast to the montane forest requirements of the nominate subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi. This pronounced difference in habitat preference was given much weight in supporting species- level recognition of the new Togian population in a recently published field guide to the region (

57

). However, given Gwee et al.’s (
7 4
) newly published data, the latter treatment has ultimately proved erroneous.

from nearby Sulawesi as well as from Greater Sundaic 
indrapurae
, 
javanicus
, 
stresemanni, biesenbachi, fumidus, seebohmi
and 
whiteheadi
in its lack of solid white or rufous on the belly; its uniform dark-brown coloration in which only the underparts show a faint warm tinge; and its unmarked dark-brown vent. The new subspecies has a darker hood and breast than the above-mentioned taxa except for the intensely rufous-bellied 
fumidus
and perhaps 
hygroscopus
. It also differs from 
deningeri
from Seram in its paler, browner (less black) body color, with a darker non-contrasting hood, and differs from 
schlegelii
and 
sterlingi
(both from Timor) in its less olive overall coloration and lack of rufous belly and vent.
</p>
            <p>
Within Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely resembles the much larger and longer-winged 
versteegi
and 
papuensis
from Papua but is dark slaty-brown (versus black) in overall body color and has an unmarked vent. The lower underparts have more extensive and paler-cinnamon feather margins in the new subspecies versus narrower, more rufous feather margins in the Papuan forms.
</p>
            <p>
Among geographically more distant Island Thrush subspecies from outside of Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely approaches three taxa from the Solomon Islands (
bougainvillei, kulambangrae, sladeni)
and two taxa from the Bismarck Archipelago (
heinrothi, beehleri
), but lacks those subspecies’ blackish overall body color. It also superficially resembles 
nigrorum
from Negros (Philippines), but the latter subspecies’ lower belly grades into whitish on the vent while the new subspecies is uniformly dark on those parts. Furthermore, another Philippine subspecies, 
kelleri
from Mt Apo (Mindanao), is similar to the new subspecies but becomes darker brown towards the front of the head while the new subspecies has a nearly uniform head coloration becoming slightly paler on the forehead.

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The subspecies name, translated from Bahasa Indonesia “it likes the rain” (=suka hujan), refers to the circumstances surrounding the bird’s discovery. On FER’s first expedition to the highest parts of Taliabu (

48

), heavy persistent rain impeded bird observations, leading to a decision to abort the expedition ahead of schedule. On his premature descent, FER then spotted a hardy individual of the new thrush, perched in the pouring rain, leading him to change plans yet again and mount a subsequent second and eventually third expedition to these elevations in better weather. This latter third expedition then allowed for a more detailed documentation of Taliabu’s distinct novel montane avifauna (

19
, 
48

). The name 
sukahujan
is treated as an inalienable noun in apposition.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>All nine specimens procured resemble one another considerably in coloration. The greatest variation occurs in the tone of the lower breast and abdomen, which is intermediate in the holotype but ranges from all-drab brownish grey throughout with almost no warm edging (in MZB.Ornit.34.416) to more extensive cinnamon feather edging (in most adult females, especially MZB.Ornit.34.409), the latter leading to an overall warmer underparts impression. Females are variably slightly less slaty on upperparts and crown, and one adult individual (MZB.Ornit.34.416) of unknown sex has a male-like slaty tone on upperparts but a female- like crown color that is more suffused with dull brown. Two juveniles (MZB.Ornit.34.410; MZB.Ornit.34.417) exhibit noticeable mottling on their mantle and underparts coloration, caused by dark brownish-black feather margins contrasting against the paler (on underparts sometimes warm cinnamon) feather centers.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new taxon was first discovered on 8 and 9 April 2009 by FER near its type locality on the occasion of a hike to the highest elevations on Taliabu that was cut short by heavy rainfall. Subsequent sightings on 14 and 15 April 2009 were made in the same area on the occasion of a return visit (

48

). We found this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected the type along with the accompanying specimens.

<tp:taxon-name>

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
With approximately 50 subspecies, the Island Thrush 
<tp:taxon-name>
Turdus poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
is arguably the most polytypic bird species on Earth (
13 5
). Attempts to separate this variable species complex into smaller species-level lineages [e.g. (
13 6
)] have been called into question by genetic data showing that plumage characters are not a good predictor of close relationships in this complex (
13 7
). Hence, modern sources generally continue to unite all or most subspecies into one polytypic species. Not unlike some Philippine subspecies previously under study (
13 7
), the new subspecies from Taliabu is phenotypically extremely different from neighboring forms but more closely resembles certain geographically distant subspecies. It is presently best accommodated at the subspecies level. Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic inquiries are needed in the future to assess whether any internal species limits must be drawn within the complex. Such future analyses may well elevate the Taliabu Island Thrush to species level. However, such analyses are currently hampered by a lack of crucial comparative DNA material.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Forehead to crown and nape dark slaty blue (2.5PB 2/2) with slightly scaly appearance generated through narrow black feather centres; the same color, but without the scaly appearance, then continues through mantle and scapulars to rump. A white supercilium starts above the centre of the eye and ends just shy of the bill base, becoming narrower towards the front. A black facial patch centred in the loral region and below the supercilium to the chin (with narrow rows of black feathers above the bill base) grades into dark slaty blue coloration (2.5PB 1.5/2) towards the auriculars and the malar and moustachial regions, merging with the nape and mantle. Upperwing coverts largely concolorous with crown, with vestiges of an extremely indistinct brighter carpal patch visible with difficulty on this specimen. Remiges are dark slaty brown (10YR 2.5/1), the larger primaries with warmer, paler outer edging (10YR 4/2). Breast intensely rufous (7.5YR 7/12), becoming slightly paler on throat and upper flanks, and becoming pale cinnamon-whitish on belly and lower flanks (7.5YR 9/4), and eventually off-white on undertail coverts. Tail dull black on upper side, blackish-grey (N2) on underside, with indistinct white base to outermost rectrices. Iris dark-brown; legs light-pink; black bill with pinkish gape flange on live bird.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
An unequivocal member of the Snowy-browed Flycatcher 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ficedula hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
, and one of its most easterly outposts, with minor plumage distinctions in the male and major plumage distinctions in the female, a combination of which conclusively demarcates this new taxon from other subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
The male subtly differs from adjacent insular subspecies to the south and to the west, namely from the two Sulawesi subspecies (
jugosae, annalisa
), from 
sumatrana
(Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo), from 
vulcani
(Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores), and from 
alifura
(Buru), in the reduction of white patches at the base of the outer tail feathers, and in the slightly less extensive rufous underparts, replaced on the belly by pale cinnamon- whitish. In contrast, males of the only subspecies to the east and north (
pallidipectus
from Bacan Island) are markedly paler on the underparts than the males of this new subspecies, and have more contrastingly olive flanks. The white supercilium in males of the new subspecies is narrower than that of at least 
sumatrana, vulcani
, and 
alifura
.
</p>
            <p>
The female is highly distinct from most subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
in her bluish (versus olive, brown or grey-brown) upperparts coloration, extensive cold-brown mottling on breast (versus little to none), and a washed-out face pattern ghosting that of the male, with a whiter (versus rufous) brow. The only other subspecies that equals female 
F. h. betinabiru
in her bluish tinge to the upperparts is 
alifura
from adjacent Buru, in which the back color is ever so slightly brighter-blue. Compared to the new subspecies, the female of 
alifura
exhibits a more rufous (less white) eye brow, and brighter and more extensive rufous underparts with less brown mottling.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>
Only adult specimens have been procured, although a photo of a 
pullus
near the nest suggests an early juvenile plumage similar to other subspecies. Among adults, tarsus color as recorded in the field on live birds appears to vary individually from light-pink to pinkish-horn.
</p>
            <p>There is minor variation among the nine adult male specimens procured in the lower extent of the rufous breast, the intensity of the cinnamon wash to the belly, thickness of the supercilium and the extent of vestigial white patches on the basal outer rectrices. There is minor variation among the five adult female specimens in the intensity of brown mottling on the underparts, width and paleness of the supercilium and the presence or absence of a slight brownish tinge to the lowermost mantle portion.</p>

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies of Snowy-browed Flycatcher was first encountered by the University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 (
64, 9 8
). Members of that survey found the new taxon predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m) and suggested that it may be a novel subspecies. FER then saw one adult male at 1100m during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu on 5 April 2009 (

48

). We returned to this general area between 6-16 December 2013, where we found 
betinabiru
as one of the most common constituents of the forest interior understorey avifauna and collected the type and accompanying individuals at ~1300m (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
Subspecies 
betinabiru
is currently only known from the understorey of dense montane forest in the highlands of Taliabu at above 800m elevation (
19, 48, 64, 9 8
). Extensive logging has occurred across the highlands of Taliabu, with some parts of the mountains additionally affected by large-scale forest fires (see Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler account in SM3; 

). As an understory inhabitant, 
betinabiru
would be particularly susceptible to this kind of habitat degradation and is therefore probably declining. Nevertheless, it remains extremely common where good habitat persists, as indicated by our high mistnet capture rates (

19

).
</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, Snowy-browed Flycatchers have not been detected on the two other main islands of the Sula Archipelago, although their occurrence is possible at least on Mangole, which rises to 1,127m, while very unlikely on Sanana, which does not rise taller than ~600m. If confirmed on Mangole, it is likely that the local population would refer to the same subspecies 
betinabiru
.
</p>
            <p>
On the adjacent Banggai Archipelago, a single Snowy-browed Flycatcher was recorded once in April 2009 at 800-900m on the tallest island of Peleng (

49

). To the best of our knowledge, there have not been subsequent records from this island despite extensive fieldwork. In the absence of photos or closer details about the single Peleng record, it is impossible to ascertain whether the Peleng population is ascribable to 
betinabiru
, to one of the two Sulawesi races (
annalisa, jugosae
) or to a novel unnamed subspecies.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We describe this new taxon on the basis of its characteristic plumage (especially in females). These plumage distinctions certainly warrant a description at the subspecific level as they exceed those of several more poorly marked subspecies within this complex (e.g. 
annalisa
[Stresemann, 1931], which only subtly differs from 
jugosae
[Riley, 1921]). Bioacoustic variation in this species complex is poorly explored, but the high-pitched courtship vocalization of the new subspecies superficially resembles that of many other subspecies, and playback of songs from other subspecies elicits a ready response from members of this population. Genetic differences between the new taxon and other subspecies remain unexplored.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Crown, nape, ear coverts and neck sides are mid-brown (7.5YR 4/2), with a distinct cinnamon-chestnut forehead extending over eye (7.5YR 4/8). Black rictal bristles. Nape color slowly grading into warmer cinnamon-rufous (2.5YR 4/10) across mantle, scapulars and rump to the basal 60% portion of tail. The outer remiges are mostly dark dusky-brown (7.5YR 2/1), becoming paler and more olive-brown (7.5YR 4/2) towards the inner remiges. All remiges have narrow but intense rufous outer edging concolorous with rump and lower back color. The wing coverts are almost identical to the inner remiges in color, with an increasing intensity and width of bright-rufous feather tipping towards the median and lesser coverts. The distal 40% of the tail is greyish-black (N2), with paler rufous tips (5YR 5/6) on the underside only. Chin and throat form a white triangle delimited below by a conspicuous large black breast patch. A diffuse band of grey coloration (N5) with a black scaly appearance created by black feathers with narrow grey edging demarcates the black breast patch on its lower side. The belly is pale buff (7.5YR 9/8), grading into a richer, fuller hue on the flanks and undertail coverts (7.5YR 5/6). The iris is dark-brown, the bill black with a pinkish base to the lower mandible, and the tarsus on the live bird was described as pinkish- horn.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A mid-sized, rufous-toned 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura
</tp:taxon-name>
typical of a radiation of fantails distributed throughout Australasia. It most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
(

57

), and constitutes the third member of this radiation. Its plumage distinctions from the other two species are subtle yet consistent. However, the most characteristic distinction is its unique courtship vocalization (
7 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, the new species differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Sula Islands in its much narrower, less distinct rufous tips to the underside of the rectrices, in its more distinct black scaling below the black breast patch, and in its more strongly cinnamon-buff (less white) central underparts. The new species’ throat is cleaner white, less interspersed with dusky tips to the feathers.
</p>
            <p>
The new species differs from all three subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi in its wider black portion of the tail and its warmer brown crown and upper mantle. When compared to the geographically most closely adjacent subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni toradja
</tp:taxon-name>
from eastern and central Sulawesi, the new species additionally differs in its cleaner white throat and slightly less conspicuous scaling below the black breast patch, while it is additionally distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
of the Lompobattang Massif in South Sulawesi by its blacker breast patch and by the richer chestnut (less cinnamon) coloration of its brighter body parts (such as supercilium, rear upperparts, flanks and vent).

Etymology

</p>
            <p>The new species’ epithet is in honor of the late Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie (deceased 11 Sep 2019), the third president of the Republic of Indonesia. President Habibie was known as a keen environmentalist and contributed greatly to the science and conservation of nature in Indonesia.</p>

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The only three specimens (all adult; one female, two males) exhibit limited variation in terms of extent of breast patch and black mottling below breast patch that may have been caused by the preparation of the specimens.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new species has doubtless been known to the local inhabitants of Peleng Island for a long time. Mochamad Indrawan was presumably the first outside ornithologist to see this new bird when encountering a dead individual during his work on Peleng in the mid-2000s and re- encountering the species in the wild on several undated occasions (

49

). During a field trip between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently observed the species near the type locality (

49

), where we returned from 18-23 Dec 2013 to collect the type and the accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new species is restricted to montane forest on the island of Peleng, the largest landmass in the Banggai Archipelago, at elevations not lower than 750m (

19
, 
49

) (

). Over two longer visits to the highlands of Peleng, we found that the species becomes gradually more common towards higher elevations before it seems to drop out somewhere slightly below the tallest peak on Peleng at 1,022m. The new species is replaced on Sulawesi to the west by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
, and on the Sula Archipelago to the east by 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Its occurrence on other islands of the Banggai Archipelago is highly unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
must be considered threatened given the small extent of its occurrence and the continuing loss of its habitat. Only 25,071 ha of land on Peleng fall above the approximate 750m elevational cutoff, most of it formerly constituting a single contiguous block of highland forest (

). However, our own observations in combination with satellite imagery indicate extensive forest loss to small-scale agriculture and logging by burgeoning village communities. Google Earth’s present coverage of the area is mixed, with large swathes covered by insufficient or outdated (e.g., 2004) imagery. However, given current satellite coverage, a conservative estimate is that 9,987 ha (~40%) from within the elevational range of

have either been completely deforested or constitute young regrowth or unviable forest fragments surrounded by clearings. This would leave only 15,084 ha of more or less undisturbed primary or older secondary forest. Recent observations indicate, however, that this extent of forest loss is probably an underestimate. After the first discovery of this species and a number of other new bird taxa on Peleng (

49

), the island became a destination for an average of 1-3 international adventure and birdwatching tour groups per year, which considerably helped spur the local economy of the village near the type locality (name withheld). While this sort of ecotourism has a positive impact on the natural environment in many reported cases, on Peleng the sudden influx of tourist dollars led to observations of increased logging and expansion of infrastructure, prompting the rapid destruction of forest at the original type locality over the last five years. In the near future, it will be of paramount importance for the survival of Peleng’s unique montane fauna to find ways in which the influx of eco-tourism dollars can create incentives for conservation.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
Based on its plumage coloration, the new species is clearly a member of the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, hitherto known from Sulawesi and the Sula Archipelago (

57

). The discovery of a new constituent of this radiation on the Banggai Archipelago closes the geographic gap between Sulawesi and Sula. Most previous taxonomic treatises (e.g. 
6 1, 7 5
) have regarded all members of this radiation as conspecific, and indeed plumage differences are relatively minor and have long been interpreted as consistent with a subspecific treatment. However, recent research into patterns of bioacoustic and genomic differentiation among rusty-bellied fantails from Sulawesi, Sula and Banggai has produced strong evidence in favor of species level treatment of all three island populations (
7 2
).

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="biology_ecology">
            <p>
Vocalizations
: Bioacoustically, the courtship vocalization (=song) of the new species from Peleng is the most distinct of any member of the radiation. A detailed characterization of this song has been published elsewhere (

49

). In fact, when we first found the species in the field, the bird stood out through its unusual, simple descending song that lacks the typical complex tinkling quality of its congeners (

49

). Quantitative bioacoustic comparisons revealed that the unusual vocal features of the new Peleng species have led to an acoustic leapfrog pattern in rusty-bellied fantails in which the two terminal (=easternmost and westernmost) species (i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) are more similar to each other in courtship vocalizations but are geographically divided by the new species with its unusual song (
7 2
). The great vocal distinctness of the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
is surprising because it belies its geographic proximity to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
(Sulawesi)
</tp:taxon-name>
across a combined lowland and sea gap of less than 40km and its frequent land connection to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
(Taliabu)
</tp:taxon-name>
across Pleistocene land bridges during times of global cooling (

49

). Vocal behavior is known to be an important feature in species cohesion and reproductive isolation in songbirds (
7 6, 77
), and has been shown to be more important as an indicator of species limits than plumage traits in some passerine lineages (

78

). Therefore, recent authors have accepted the unmistakable vocal uniqueness of the new Peleng fantail as an indication of its status as an undescribed new species (
57, 7 2
).

Genomic data
: In a previously published analysis (
7 2
), we conducted a comparison of&gt;11,000 genome-wide markers with a complete representation among 16 individuals spanning all three species within the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. In this analysis, the new species from Peleng emerged as most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (both subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
toradja
) and less closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sula. This phylogenomic result is significant considering that – among all pairwise vocal comparisons – the greatest bioacoustic differentiation is found between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and the new species, with strong vocal distinctions in both non-courtship vocalizations and courtship songs (
7 2
). Therefore, the relatively shallowest genomic differentiation among the three island populations corresponds to the deepest bioacoustic divergence.
</p>
            <p>
Although the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
emerged as most closely related within the radiation, comparisons of genome-wide data allow for the designation of both taxa as independent species: the basal split between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other taxa is mainly based on a genomic signal contained in ~20% of the genetic variance across study loci, whereas the second most dominant genomic signature – contained in ~14% of the genetic variance across markers – predominantly represents the deep divergence between the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
[

in (
7 2
)]. The presence of a significant proportion of genomic locus cohorts displaying deep differentiation between the new species and either of its two neighbors was in agreement with gene flow analyses (‘ABBA-BABA tests’) that pointed to a history of rare introgression between the new species and its neighbors (
7 2
), perhaps during episodes of unusual climate forcing dispersal between islands. Such secondary introgression is not unusual among congeneric bird species (

79

) and is not in conflict with species level treatment.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>
The entire crown from forehead to nape is rich earthen-brown (7.5YR 3/3) with slightly darker feather margins creating a scalloped appearance. A thin off-white supercilium is pronounced from bill base to just behind eye, from where it slowly tapers out. Lores are dark brownish-black (2.5Y 1.5/1). Ear coverts are of a medium earthen-brown tone (5YR 3/1) with fine pale shaft streaks giving a grizzled appearance, grading into a more greyish-brown tone (10YR 6/1) in the moustachial and malar region. The mantle and scapulars down to the uppertail coverts are largely concolorous with the crown but lack the scalloping created by darker feather margins. The remiges are mostly a rich cold dark-brown (2.5YR 2/1) but have warmer outer webs concolorous with mantle. The upperwing coverts are similarly two-toned, being mostly concolorous with mantle but some showing darker outer webs concolorous with most of remiges. As typical for the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
, the rectrices are narrow and dark- brown, very close in color to the remiges (2.5YR 2/1). The tail feathers are mostly worn, although one in the centre appears to be a new replacement.
</p>
            <p>The white chin and throat are quite sharply demarcated from the face. The lower throat and upper breast, still white, are interspersed with fine dusky speckling increasing towards the breast and lower throat sides where the color grades into a solid mid-grey (N5) with only few inconspicuous dusky speckles. The grey breast color then grades into a tawny- ochraceous belly color (7.5YR 4/6), first through tracts of grey feathers which have warm- ochraceous edging, then through tracts of largely ochraceous feathers that still have a grey feather centre, eventually to all-ochraceous feathers. The belly color becomes darker and richer on the undertail coverts and flanks (7.5YR 3/4).</p>
            <p>The bill is black with an inconspicuous paler tip. The gape on the live bird was slightly enlarged light yellow. The iris is dark brown. The tarsus and toes were described on the live bird as maroon-horn with paler, more yellowish toepads.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A rich dark-brown forest warbler typical of the montane resident 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. As is usual across this cryptic genus, the new taxon is most conspicuous not on the basis of its plumage but its vocalizations.
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, it is most similar in size and shape to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
of Sulawesi. However, in comparison to the new taxon, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
has less distinct speckling on the breast, has a more uniform crown that is less scalloped, paler and warmer brown upperparts, greyer underparts with brown mostly only on flanks, and has a less pointed, wider tail.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram differs in its less distinct central breast spotting, greyer (less whitish) supercilium, and more extensive grey on breast reaching further onto upper breast, neck sides and auriculars.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru differs in its much whiter breast, with off-white reaching onto mid-belly, whereas only the lower flanks and lower belly are warm-brown. Although the central breast of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
has a mid-grey tinge, its underparts are much paler than the new species’ fairly uniform grey lower breast, which grades into a fairly dark homogeneous warm-brown belly.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is quite different from the smaller 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. montis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Java. The latter is much paler cinnamon-brown on upperparts, crown and especially remiges and rectrices, and is uniformly buff-white below with extensive dark-brown speckling from chin to upper belly, lacking the new species’ grey tones on the breast and dark warm-brown tones on the belly.

The name 
<tp:taxon-name>
portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
– past participle of Latin ‘portendere’ – roughly translates as “the predicted one” or “the foretold one” and relates to the unusual circumstances of discovery when FER first heard the new warbler and recognized it to be a novel species of

multiple days before a visual confirmation was obtained.

            <p>Currently only one adult specimen is available (i.e., the holotype), and photos of up to two more adults suggest that this is probably a sexually monomorphic species with limited plumage variation.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
FER was the first person to discover 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on 9 April 2009 near its type locality when he heard an unmistakable insect-like sound that he attributed to a hitherto unnamed taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
grasshopper-warbler. Having been exposed to the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on a visit to Sulawesi only two weeks prior, and having had previous field experience with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru and Seram, respectively (
8 0
), FER was aware that the song of this population – albeit superficially reminiscent of the others – is distinct at the species level. Even so, because of the retiring nature of this bird and ill-timed heavy rain, it took FER another two hiking expeditions to the highlands of Taliabu to finally confirm on 15 April 2009 that this song was indeed uttered by what he perceived as an “unusually dark” individual of grasshopper-warbler (

48

). We encountered this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected a single specimen, now the holotype.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is presumably restricted to montane forest at the highest elevations of the island of Taliabu (

19
, 
48

) (

). All our records are from elevations above 1,050m on the more mountainous western half of the island of Taliabu, which reaches its highest altitude of ~1,415m at an unnamed peak near our collection locality (

). The new species inhabits a peculiar type of dwarf montane forest typical of these elevations.
</p>
            <p>
The occurrence of the new species on neighboring islands is highly doubtful. Of the three major islands that form the Sula archipelago, Taliabu is the largest and tallest. The smallest main island, Sanana, barely reaches above 600m elevation. The highest elevation on its larger neighbor Mangole is 1,127m – theoretically within the elevational range of this grasshopper-warbler – but the area of land above 1,050m on Mangole is only ~36 ha, which is too small an area to allow for the survival of a highly montane bird species throughout evolutionary time scales. On the neighboring Banggai archipelago, the situation is similar: the only island high enough to allow for the theoretical possibility of grasshopper-warbler breeding occurrence is Peleng (highest elevation ~1,022m), but extensive fieldwork around this highest area has not revealed the presence of any resident grasshopper-warblers (

19
, 
49

).
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
must be a rare bird: Taliabu’s area above 1,050m amounts to ~16,690 ha of formerly forested land in the interior of the island’s western half, over 97% of which forms one contiguous block (

). However, satellite imagery predominantly from 2004 indicates that a total of ~1,023 ha (~6.1%) of this area had been affected by logging operations that have degraded the forest and removed its undercover, presumably rendering the affected areas unsuitable, or nearly so, for the grasshopper-warbler. In the one-and-a-half decades since the satellite images were obtained, extensive additional logging is likely to have occurred. Another 940 ha (~5.6%) of the area above 1,050m have succumbed to a series of catastrophic forest fires in 1982 and 1983, and now constitute open grassland habitat unsuitable for this warbler (

). Our surveys showed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
does not occur in the extensive recently generated grasslands in the highlands of Taliabu (

48

). This leaves 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
with less than 15,000 ha of suitable habitat, an area likely to further diminish in size with ongoing habitat destruction and the impacts of global warming leading to an upward elevational shift of habitat zones.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We include this new taxon within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
following the phylogenetic demonstration that the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bradypterus
</tp:taxon-name>
(previously used for this Southeast Asian clade of warblers) is restricted to Africa (
8 1, 8 2
). Its inclusion within 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
is the reason why we follow the recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] of using the English moniker ‘grasshopper-warbler’ rather than the term ‘bush-warbler’, which is more appropriately reserved for members of a radiation in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Cettiidae</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
is renowned for its cryptic and conservative coloration that has confounded plumage-based classifications for decades and led to delays in the recognition of species-level taxa until bioacoustic and molecular methods have been applied (
8 3, 8 4
). In Wallacea, members of a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from Sulawesi and the Moluccas were previously united into a single polytypic species 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
(
6 1, 7 5
), but have recently been divided into three constituent island species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru, on the basis of their strikingly different songs (

57

). Our new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is geographically surrounded by constituents of this radiation and is a member of it both on the basis of morphological characters (see Diagnosis) and bioacoustic ones.
</p>
            <p>
Although plumage distinctions are not as important in the genus, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by comparatively unique, dark-brown upperparts that stand in contrast to the generally paler and warmer-brown upperparts of neighboring species. However, we mainly attribute species status to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on the basis of its unique song and genetic differentiation. We here provide an excerpt of ongoing analyses as relating to the bioacoustic and mitogenomic differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from neighboring species.

Bioacoustic evidence
: A total of 41 suitable, high-quality, homologous 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
song recordings from the field were gathered for analysis from various sources, encompassing all three previous species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation plus the new species. These recordings were measured for 11 suitable bioacoustic parameters, and resultant measurements were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and a conservative vocal diagnosability criterion (

85

), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Further details regarding all analyzed recordings, such as GPS locations, dates, times, and names of recordists, are listed in table S3, while more details on bioacoustic methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
Based on the Isler Criterion, eight out of eleven song parameters measured were diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and two other taxa: 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (table S4). Four out of eleven parameters were Isler-diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (table S4). The ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) can be adopted to ascertain if the level of vocal divergence between these archipelagic taxa is comparable in magnitude to divergences across unequivocal species-level divisions. When comparing Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler song against that of the Friendly Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
, a geographically distant species from montane Borneo that has never been included in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, only two parameters emerged as Isler-diagnosable (table S4). Using this result as a yardstick for what constitutes species level vocal differentiation, the magnitude of vocal divergence between Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
on Seram, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
on Buru, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on Sulawesi is extremely high, indicating they all have diagnosably distinct vocalizations that are best reflected in species rank.
</p>
            <p>
Principal component analysis of the vocal measurements underscores the vocal distinctness of Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from the other three Wallacean species (

). A cumulative proportion of variance of 73.3% is accounted for in the first two principal components, suggesting a strong vocal differentiation between Taliabu and the remaining taxa (

).
</p>
            <p>
Mitogenomic evidence
: Using whole-genome sequencing and laboratory approaches for the use of ancient DNA, we created an alignment of whole-mitochondrial sequences spanning ~15,000 base pairs (bp) across 11 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals belonging to all four constituent island forms of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, and used three different phylogenetic tree-building methodologies to investigate relationships and levels of divergence. More details on the methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
All three phylogenetic trees produced indicated identical topologies with high bootstrap support (

), suggesting that the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is an independent lineage most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (mitogenomic divergence ~2%), and much more distantly related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (divergence ~4.8–5%) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (divergence ~7.7–8%). Mitogenomic divergences roughly correlate with those from the COI barcoding gene, although they do not have to be equal in magnitude.
</p>
            <p>
Integrating the vocal and mitogenomic evidence, it is clear that bioacoustic differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, the two species which emerged most closely related on the mitogenomic tree (

), far exceed those between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and a geographically distant species (
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
) that has never been closely associated with the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. Our combined evidence therefore supports the treatment of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
as a well-diverged small-insular endemic species.

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic sampling:
We obtained 41 homologous recordings, which were either recorded by us in the field, or privately sourced from avid field ornithologists (including Robert O. Hutchinson and Ross Gallardy), or collected from publicly accessible online databases, namely the Avian Vocalization Center (AVoCet at http://avocet. integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu), the Xeno-Canto Sound Library (www.xeno-canto.org), the Macaulay Sound Library (www.macaulaylibrary.org), and the Internet Bird Collection (www.hbw.com/ibc).
</p>
            <p>Although slight variation in recording quality exists in the equipment used, inspection and comparison of spectrograms from different devices showed that this variation is comparable to that amongst recordings made by one sole recordist using the same device. In addition, although there is some variability in background noise, spectrogram inspection suggested that measurements of vocalizations would not be affected. Measurements of the recordings were performed using the program Raven Pro Version 1.5 (Bioacoustics Research Program, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA) on its default settings. The following eleven parameters were chosen for bioacoustic analysis, with each parameter averaged over all the measurements across one recording:</p>

Bioacoustic analysis:
The vocal diagnosability criterion outlined by Isler et al. (
8 5
), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, was used to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Besides other oscine passerines (
73, 8 6
), this criterion has been employed as a bioacoustic species delimitation method across Asian birds such as owls (

58
, 
87

), pigeons (

50
, 
52
, 
88

), and nightjars (

89

). The Isler criterion has two parts which must be fulfilled in order to infer diagnosability. Firstly, the range of measurements of a parameter between two taxa must not exhibit overlap, and secondly, the data have to satisfy the following equation: 
xa
+ 
taSDa ≤xb–tbSDb,
where (
x
) refers to the respective means of measurements in taxon a and b, and 
ti
refers to the t-score at the 95th percentile of the t distribution for 
n-1
degrees of freedom. This is a stricter statistical test than the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (
8 5
) as it employs the standard deviation of the sample points instead of the taxon mean, allowing for the diagnosis of distinctions between taxa under more rigorous conditions. Successful Isler diagnosability is defined here as the presence of at least one vocally diagnostic parameter between taxa.

DNA extraction methods:
Fresh tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
was DNA- sequenced along with the following number of toepad scrapings of historical museum specimens: three of the Buru Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, three of the Seram Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and four of the Sulawesi Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
. All museum samples had been kindly contributed by the American Museum of Natural History (for voucher numbers, see 

and table S5). DNA extraction was carried out with the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extraction of the historic museum specimens’ toepad scrapings was conducted by trained personnel (CYG) in a room dedicated to ancient DNA extraction to preclude DNA contamination. The toepads were rinsed with water four times before extraction to ensure preservatives were removed, and DTT was added to facilitate digestion of keratin present in toepads. The concentrations of the DNA extracts were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay.
</p>
            <p>
DNA sequencing methods:
The holotype’s DNA extract was sheared into smaller fragments of ~250 base pairs (bp) using 13 cycles of 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off on a Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode, USA). Whole-genome library preparation for the holotype was carried out using a NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, USA) for Illumina according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the museum toepad extracts, the shearing step was omitted as the ancient DNA is already degraded and NEBNext FFPE DNA repair mix (New England Biolabs, USA) was added to each ancient DNA sample prior to library preparation to fix damage common to degraded DNA such as deamination, nicks and gaps. In addition, size selection of library preparation products was omitted for the toepad samples to reduce DNA loss from bead selection. A total of five PCR cycles were run on the holotype’s DNA extract and 12 PCR cycles on the toepads’ extracts. Whole-genome library preparation of toepad samples was carried out in a room with a PCR hood dedicated to ancient library preparation work. The concentrations and peak fragment sizes of the libraries were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay and an Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer (Agilent, USA), respectively. The peak fragment sizes of the historic museum samples and the fresh holotype (including adaptors and unique indexes) were ~230bp and ~380bp, respectively. All prepared libraries were sent to NovogeneAIT Genomics Singapore for Illumina sequencing using a HiSeq 4000 platform to produce 150bp paired-end reads.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial genome alignment
: Trimmomatic (version 0.33) (

90

) was used to remove adaptors and filter low quality reads (below 15 Phred quality score). We applied the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (version 0.7.15-r1140) (
9 1
) to align reads to a mitochondrial reference genome, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella pryeri
</tp:taxon-name>
(Genbank accession no.: NC_029151), with a minimum mapping quality score of 30. Samtools (version 1.9) (
9 2, 9 3
) was run to convert the SAM output files from the alignment to a BAM format for downstream analysis. Then Picard (version 2.18.21; http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) was employed to insert read groups and remove PCR duplicate artifacts. The BAM files were then imported into CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0.4 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com) for remapping to the same reference genome using the following mapping parameters: mismatch penalty of 1, insertion penalty of 1, and deletion penalty of 1. The reads were locally realigned at indel regions, and the consensus sequences were extracted at a minimum coverage threshold of 100. A mapping summary produced by Qualimap (version 2.2.1) (
9 4
) indicated that our mitochondrial genome coverage ranged between ~290–2920x for museum samples and ~6430x for the holotype (table S5). Sequences are deposited with GenBank at accession numbers 
MN597052
- 
MN597062
.
</p>
            <p>
Phylogenetic analysis
: The consensus sequences were exported in FASTA format and visually realigned in MEGA7 (

95

), producing a final whole-mitochondrial alignment of ~15,000bp. MEGA7 was used to construct a neighbor-joining tree based on uncorrected p- divergences and a maximum parsimony tree. Additionally, we ran raxmlGUI 1.5 beta (

96

) to construct a maximum likelihood tree using the GTRGAMMA model as specified by jModelTest (version 2.1.7) (

97

). All tree-building analyses were conducted with 10,000 bootstrap replicates. Pairwise uncorrected p-divergences across the mitogenomic alignment were calculated in MEGA7 with 10,000 bootstrap replicates.

            <p>Head and mantle down to uppertail coverts and to central belly are bright scarlet-red (7.5R 4/14) with subtle blackish suffusion owing to individual feathers having broad red distal half followed by black and then increasingly greyish basal half; jet-black narrow orbital ring and loral line. Upperwings, sides of mantle, scapulars and rectrices are matt black, with the remiges appearing slightly duskier black because of narrow olive edging to outer webs; underwing coverts and outer webs of the underside of remiges are whitish; a blackish-grey (N1.5) wedge extends from vent up to central belly.

The diagnosis refers to the adult male plumage only. Female 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals of the Wallacean radiation are generally very similar across species, and more research is needed to identify good distinguishing marks.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is an obvious, bright scarlet-and-black representative of the Wallacean grouping of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters that have often been united within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
complex (
6 1, 7 5
), but have been considered a radiation of independent species by more recent authors [e.g. (

57

)]. Within this radiation, the new species most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species has a more extensive and brighter red body and blacker wings, scapulars, and tail. Scarlet feathers in the new species are mostly black and grey at the base, with only the distal half scarlet, and with a sharp contrast between scarlet and black, lacking 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
’s narrow yellow bands in between the red and black portions of each individual feather that render the latter’s overall body more orange-tinted. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the red is not as extensive on the underparts, and the abdomen and vent are paler buff-white versus blackish-grey in the new species.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species is paler and greyer (not black) on vent and abdomen. It also has a smudgier scarlet body coloration (caused by the black and grey basal halves of individual feathers), with dark smudges especially pronounced on face and on breast sides, as compared to more uniform red underparts, head and mantle in 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
. Black lores in the new species are wider and not as clearly delimited as in 
<tp:taxon-name>

.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis

Etymology

</p>
            <p>We name this species after the village of Wahe (1.716°S, 124.843°E), which is the gateway to the highest elevations on Taliabu where it most commonly occurs. The species epithet is an indeclinable noun in apposition.</p>

Individual, age-related and sexual variation within taxon

</p>
            <p>
Two adult male specimens (holotype and 34.356) are virtually identical in coloration. Two additional male specimens (34.373 and 34.403), most likely immatures, are similar but have the scarlet body color replaced with a more rose-red hue (5R 4/14); they also do not exhibit any distinct olive margins of remiges. No comparative specimen material exists for adult females of the new species, which are generally similar among all regional 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species. Photos confirm that the female of the new species resembles other regional species (data not shown). One juvenile specimen (34.407) lacks red coloration and is generally drab grayish-brown (paler on underparts), becoming more intense earthen-brown on the mantle, rump and upperwing coverts, with the underside of remiges and rectrices mid-grey.

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
was first spotted by a University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 led by P.J. Davidson. Participants of this exploratory survey were probably the first ornithologists to visit the highlands of Taliabu between 600-800 m elevation (
64, 9 8
), where they found the new species predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m). FER then encountered the species commonly during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu between 4-18 April 2009 (

19
, 
48

), where we returned between 6-16 December 2013 to collect the holotype and accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has thus far only been found on the island of Taliabu within the Sula Archipelago. On Taliabu, we have recorded it from sea level to 1,300m (

19
, 
48

), and it presumably occurs further up all the way to the highest elevation at ~1,415m. The species inhabits forest canopy and edge habitat, and is a nectarivore and frugivore that has been photographed feeding at flowers (

48

). Akin to multiple other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species in Wallacea (

57

), the new species is seen far more often at higher elevations (roughly above ~800m) than in the lowlands. Davidson et al. (

64

), who first sighted this species, exclusively found it at higher elevations, mostly around ~800m, and we recorded it as “abundant” above 800m, whereas we have only had a handful of sightings in the lowlands. It is unknown to what extent elevational differences in abundance reflect the difficulty of detecting a canopy bird in tall lowland forest as compared to stunted montane forest. However, although detection difficulties may help mask its true abundance in the lowlands, we do not believe it is possible for the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
to be equally common across elevations given that other small canopy birds do not escape detection in the lowlands and are recorded commonly. In fact, the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
may even be a breeding endemic to montane elevations and only venture into the lowlands seasonally, following tree flowering and fruiting events. This potential seasonal displacement would explain why some expeditions have completely overlooked it in the lowlands while others have recorded it on occasion.
</p>
            <p>
It is contentious whether the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
is endemic to Taliabu, or also occurs on the other two main islands of the Sula Archipelago (Mangole and Sanana). The latter two have received even less ornithological attention than Taliabu, and to the best of our knowledge, the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has never been recorded there on recent ornithological expeditions (D. Yong, pers. comm.; J.A. Eaton, pers. comm.). Sanana is relatively low-lying (up to ~600m) and therefore likely to lack a number of Taliabu’s montane species. Mangole reaches its highest peak at 1,127m, but areas above 800m are confined to ~328 ha only, which gives it a comparatively small area of true montane forest. The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
’s level of dependence on vegetation at high elevations probably determines whether it would be capable of occurring on Mangole or even Sanana. Future fieldwork on those two islands will shed light on whether the new species occurs there or not.
</p>
            <p>
FER and Filip Verbelen first discovered a new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
population in the mountains of Peleng in the neighboring Banggai Archipelago during a visit between 23-30 March 2009 and recorded it as reasonably common at elevations between 700-900m in the western Peleng highlands (

49

). On our collecting expedition, we only had one aural encounter of this 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
on Peleng on 21 Dec 2013, indicating that the population might have been seasonally displaced or more retiring (

19

). However, photographic evidence from the 2009 visit indicates that the Peleng population has a plumage coloration that is very similar – if not identical – to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and quite different from 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
. As this Peleng population remains uncollected, future fieldwork will hopefully produce specimens allowing a determination whether there are differences between the Peleng birds and 
<tp:taxon-name>

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu is obviously a member of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, which used to be considered a single wide-ranging polytypic species for a long time (
6 1, 7 5
), but has now been divided into multiple monotypic island endemics by most recent authors on the basis of extensive plumage differences [e.g. (
57, 8 0, 99
)]. Within this radiation, its plumage most closely resembles that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, but is discrete from both of them in multiple characters (see Diagnosis). Its morphological differences from both 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
exceed those between other closely related species pairs within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. dammermani
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
(

73

). Therefore, its diagnosis here as a species level taxon rests on Mayr and Ashlock’s (

70

) yardstick approach, by which species status is conferred on the basis of divergences that exceed those of species pairs in which biologically important differences have been unequivocally demonstrated.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters have a wide vocal repertoire that is oftentimes problematic in the context of bioacoustic analysis (

73

). The Taliabu 
<tp:taxon-name>Myzomela</tp:taxon-name>
was hardly vocal during our encounters, and we do not consider vocalizations a fruitful taxonomic avenue in delimiting this new species from others. Instead, we have generated mitochondrial sequence data to further shed light on the new species’ taxonomic status.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial evidence
: Our mitochondrial tree analysis was based on sequences of the coding gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), comparing 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
to a great majority of members of the eastern and central Indonesian radiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters. Results indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
is most closely related to geographically adjacent species such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (

). Our analysis does not provide resolution on whether either 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
constitute the sister species to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
, and in fact, the latter two may well be sister to each other instead (

), rendering 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
a more basal species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from adjacent Buru is not represented in our mitochondrial dataset, and likely forms part of this group. Based on plumage coloration, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
is frequently considered to constitute the sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, and the two are sometimes merged under one species [e.g. (

99

)]. Therefore, we assume that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
– albeit closely related – will probably not emerge as the direct sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
in future analyses.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial ND2 divergence values between 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
and its two most closely related relatives (

<tp:taxon-name>M. elisabethae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chloroptera</tp:taxon-name>

) range between 3.5%–4.3% (

), well above the mitochondrial divergence threshold of 2-3% widely postulated in the literature (
10 0, 10 1
), providing additional support for species level recognition of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial analysis:
We extracted DNA from the breast muscle tissue of all our 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
material (n = 5), and from four independently collected 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
samples (

73

), using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. ND2 was then sequenced following Lim et al. (
10 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Using CodonCode Aligner version 8.0.2. (CodonCode, USA), our ND2 sequences were trimmed and assembled. These sequences of 991 bp length were then aligned in MEGA7 (
9 5
) with the ND2 sequences of 23 other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>The crown (from forehead to nape) is cold brown (2.5Y 2/2), delimited below by a narrow long white supercilium from bill base to napeside. Lores dark greyish brown (2.5Y 3/1) extending to just behind eye in the form of an eyestripe cutting through a broken white eye ring formed by small feathers peripheral to the eye. Black rictal bristles. Ear coverts and malar, facial and moustachial regions show white-and-dusky grizzling. Most of upperparts, including mantle, scapulars and rump, are mid-olive (5Y 4/4), while remiges are distinctly darker-olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). The white chin and throat are characterized by sporadic dusky speckles and lemon streaks increasing towards the lower throat, and grading into a fully lemon to sulphur yellow breast and belly (5Y 9/12). The yellow on the breast and belly has an olive-mottled appearance because of olive feather tips (5Y 4/4), especially pronounced towards the flanks, and white feather bases, especially pronounced towards the abdomen. The vent is solid lemon-yellow (5Y8/7). Iris dark-brown; bill black. Tarsus, toes and claws pinkish-grey with toepads paler yellowish.</p>

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The new species name is derived from “suara merdu” in Bahasa Indonesia, translating as “melodious voice”, referring to the pleasing vocalizations of this bird that FER heard hours before the first individual was seen, allowing for predictions prior to visual confirmation that this would be a new

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
During a visit to the highlands of Peleng between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently encountered this species at elevations between 700-900m (

49

). When hiking up to these elevations for the first time and hearing the melodious warble of this taxon in the distance, its superficial vocal resemblance to other members of the Wallacean 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation prompted FER to predict that this would be a new leaf-warbler taxon long before they laid their eyes on it. Once they first saw it, it was noticeable for its unusual behavior of frequently climbing along larger branches and trunks of trees in the manner of a treecreeper (
<tp:taxon-name>
Certhia
</tp:taxon-name>
). On our collecting expedition to Peleng between 18-23 Dec 2013, the species was less commonly encountered (

19

), probably because of seasonality.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new leaf-warbler is restricted to the highland forests of western Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago at elevations above 700m, reaching the highest island altitude above 1000m (

). Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago must be in serious doubt because only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, of which only 5 ha of land lie above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. Beyond the Banggai Archipelago,

Lemon ear coverts down to malar and moustachial regions (5Y 9/10) grizzled with dusky-olive feather edging, making for a mottled facial appearance. Upperparts from mantle and scapulars to rump are mid-olive (7.5Y 4/6). Remiges are distinctly darker- olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). Underparts from chin to vent are largely lemon to sulphur yellow, with white feather bases creating a more lemon-yellow hue on throat, breast and belly (7.5Y 8/8) and olive feather tips (5Y 4/4) generating a more olive- mottled appearance on flanks, while the undertail coverts are largely uniform lemon (5Y 9/12).</p>

<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
A University of East Anglia expedition by Davidson et al. (

64

) was the first to find a resident population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers on Taliabu, which they encountered commonly in montane forest and which they considered to represent an undescribed taxon. Rheindt (

48

) then studied this leaf warbler during his visit between 4-18 April 2009, and we found them again during our expedition between 6-16 Dec 2 013 and collected two (

19

).

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>
Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new warbler inhabits disturbed and undisturbed montane forest on Taliabu from 700m up to probably the highest elevations above 1,400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). It may also occur on the large neighboring island of Mangole, which rises to 1,127m and should harbor enough area of montane forest habitat above 700m to sustain a population. However, a lack of fieldwork in the mountains of Mangole means that there is no information available on its montane avifauna. The smallest main constituent of the Sula Archipelago, the densely populated island of Sanana, is unlikely to sustain any 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers as it barely reaches above 600m, which seems to be too low for this species. The species is replaced on the Banggai Archipelago by the newly described 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
(see SM5), while 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
replace it in various parts of Sulawesi. Given its more relaxed elevational requirements and its tolerance for disturbed habitat, this species is probably not as immediately endangered as some of the other montane Taliabu avifauna.

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
)


</p>
            <p>
The leaf-warbler genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
constitutes a large Old World radiation of small passerines that is exceptionally well-studied in phylogenetic terms (
10 6-1 09
). Recent demonstrations of genus paraphyly in combination with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
[summarized in (
10 8
)] have prompted a variety of new generic treatments, including a division into two re-defined genera [
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
; see (

57

)], but we here follow the latest phylogenetic treatise that suggests a merger of all 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
into a single genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
10 8
).
</p>
            <p>
Despite the genus’s well-known evolutionary history, a sizeable sub-clade of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Australasian (including Indonesian) Archipelago has largely been omitted from modern molecular insights. Notable exceptions include the first-ever example of a new avian species description (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. rotiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) partly based on genome-wide DNA data from the Timor region (
11 0
). However, most island populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
in this region have been merged into a limited number of ‘wastebasket species’, e.g. Mountain Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trivirgatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and Island Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
, although vocal and plumage differences among them often far exceed those documented among the better- studied continental groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
8 0
). As a consequence, some modern treatments [e.g. (

57

)] have adopted a ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) in which pairwise plumage and vocal differences between archipelagic taxa that are comparable in magnitude to those between better-studied continental species pairs (or exceed them) are interpreted as being indicative of species status. In this way, a number of highly distinct island taxa have been elevated to species level, such as Buru Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. everetti
, Seram Leaf Warbler
</tp:taxon-name>
               <tp:taxon-name>
P. ceramensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[a treatment that had previously been suggested on the basis of vocal and plumage comparisons; see (

80

)], and a number of additional Wallacean taxa. Our description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
follows this framework of affording species rank to taxa when vocal and plumage characters indicate deeper divisions. We also bring genome-wide DNA data to bear on the taxonomic classification of these two new species. However, following the yardstick approach as applied under the Biological Species Concept, we believe that biological characters, especially bioacoustic ones, will be the most important indicators when conferring species status in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers.
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: As for plumage characters, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
differ from each other and from surrounding taxa in a number of important traits (see Diagnosis for each taxon) which are far more salient than the plumage differences of often identical-looking species pairs on the Asian continent that are otherwise vocally and phylogenetically deeply diverged [e.g. the three members of the Arctic Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. borealis
</tp:taxon-name>
trio; (
11 1
)]. Most importantly, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
has a contrastingly white throat and supercilium and a grey-and-white grizzled auricular patch where all other surrounding taxa are much more yellowish, rendering it instantly recognizable in large series of specimens. In contrast, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is superficially reminiscent of Sulawesi Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
in its overall more yellowish coloration, displaying a phenotypic leapfrog pattern that has been documented from the Taliabu-Peleng-Sulawesi island trio on multiple previous occasions (
50, 7 2
). However, this superficial resemblance notwithstanding, it has important distinctions in bare-parts coloration and overall pigmentation (see Diagnosis), apart from obvious vocal differences.

Bioacoustic evidence
: In bioacoustic terms, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by melodious jumbles of 1–1.5sec, mostly at 2000–6000 Hz, with short individual high notes between 5000–7000 Hz occasionally interspersed. Song motifs generally lack repetitive element sequences or trills (

). In contrast, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by 1.5–3sec strophes mostly between 2000–6500 Hz (typically of a wider frequency range than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
) that constitute a melodious jumble often followed by a final repetitive phrase, which can sometimes be omitted (

). In this respect, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is slightly more reminiscent of the East Sulawesi population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng (despite the geographic proximity of the latter two). The 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
population on Gunung Tumpu (East Sulawesi) is often characterized by strong repetitive series at a very broad frequency range (2500–7000 Hz), mostly preceded by a variable but simple melodious series of elements between 2000–5000 Hz and a brief nasal note separating this variable series from the repetitive series (

). Depending on the presence or absence of components, the song rendition (=motif) can be 1.5–4sec long. In summary, the songs of these three forms (

<tp:taxon-name>P. suaramerdu</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. emilsalimi</tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
), while highly variable, are predictably different and strongly indicative of species status when put into the context of song differences among other 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
species (

).

Genomic evidence
: We generated a set of ~4,100 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment spanning almost 3 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial cytochrome- 
b
(cyt- 
b
) sequences, to shed light on the differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in separate Methods paragraphs below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three taxa (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
from East Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population-genomic space based on ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (

). The main division according to genomic PCA occurred between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
versus the other two taxa (PC1 in 

). The same relationship was strongly reflected in maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of concatenated genome-wide sequence alignments of almost 3 million base pairs length as well as in maximum-parsimony (MP) analysis of a concatenated set of ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (topology 1 in 

). In contrast, mitochondrial cyt- 
b
gene analysis and species-tree inference of genome-wide SNPs recovered a topology in which 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
were strongly supported sister lineages, with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
being more basal (topology 2 in 

). Depths of uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence (as determined by cyt- 
b
distances) were comparatively low across all three leaf-warblers (0.7-1.6%; 

).
</p>
            <p>
In summary, our phylogenomic analyses demonstrated considerable incongruence among tree topologies, including a strong mito-nuclear discordance that calls into doubt the reliability of mitochondrial divergence values in this dataset. For instance, the deepest genomic divergence was detected between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other two species (PC1 in 

), whereas on mitochondrial cyt- 
b
evidence 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
displayed some of the most shallow divergences from the other taxa (

). The use of mitochondrial divergences in species delimitation suffers from multiple confounding biases (
79, 10 0, 10 1
), especially when dealing with complexes containing closely-allied allopatric taxa that have a propensity for secondary gene flow (
11 2-11 4
). The best explanatory hypothesis for the pronounced mito- nuclear discordance in this dataset is that occasional overwater dispersal followed by hybridization and gene flow may have led to the introgression of foreign alleles in one or the other species, obfuscating clean branching patterns. Gene flow during sporadic hybridization is known to artifactually reduce mitochondrial divergences, masking deeper levels of genomic differentiation (

79

). Hence, introgression can account for the presence of relatively low mitochondrial divergences in a group of species characterized by comparatively deep genomic divergences and pronounced levels of bioacoustic differentiation [(

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted DNA from the fresh muscle tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and the three specimens collected by us (including the holotype) of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
, along with one individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
that we had collected on Mt Tumpu on the eastern peninsula of Sulawesi (

19

). Additional tissue samples were obtained from the American Museum of Natural History, New York (AMNH): three samples of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
from South Sulawesi and an outgroup sample of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus pallescens
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Solomon Islands. The AMNH samples were only used for phylogenomic rooting. DNA extraction was performed using the Exgene Clinic SV kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul) following the manufacturer’s instructions. We eluted the DNA in two consecutive rounds of 100μl molecular grade water. We prepared double-digest restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing (ddRADSeq) libraries using the same protocol as Garg et al. (
11 5
) with EcoRI and MspI as restriction enzymes. We quantified DNA and library product concentrations using the Qubit 2.0 Broad Range DNA Assay (Invitrogen, California), and used a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Iowa) to perform final quality checks on the library product. The genomic libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform at the Singapore Center for Environmental Life Science Engineering. Filtering and demultiplexing of the genomic data in STACKS 1.34 followed the same general procedures as detailed by Ng et al. (
7 2
), and are the result of comprehensive trials using a wide variety of different parameters and settings at each step of the analysis. DNA data is deposited with Genbank at BioProject accession number PRJNA566263.
</p>
            <p>
SNP calling and genomic supermatrix generation:
Reference genome alignment was performed using BWA 0.7.12 (
9 1
) and samtools 0.1.19 (http://samtools.sourceforge.net) (
9 2, 9 3
) on the Greenish Warbler (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
) genome (
11 6
), the most closely related available full genome. We performed SNP calling in STACKS 1.34 as per Ng et al. (
7 2
). We required loci to be present across all individuals, and retained one random SNP per locus to exclude obviously linked SNP loci. Subsequently, we used PLINK 1.9 (
11 7
) and Bayescan 2.1 (
11 8
) to filter SNPs for linkage disequilibrium and signs of selection. Data format manipulation and conversions were performed with PGDSpider (
1 19
). The final filtered dataset totaled 4,104 SNPs. In addition, we created concatenated SNP datasets for each group for use in downstream maximum parsimony analysis.
</p>
            <p>
Following the procedures used by Ng et al. (
7 2
), we generated a concatenated read supermatrix without missing data using pyRAD (
12 0
). We stipulated a minimum required locus coverage of 20, and kept the clustering threshold within and between reads at the default of 0.88. The final concatenated read supermatrix amounted to 2,861,661 bp in length, generated from 19,985 loci.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial sequence generation:
We sequenced cyt- 
b
using the primers H16065 (
12 1
) and L14995 (
12 2
), with 40 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 72°C. We conducted PCR product cleanup with ExoSAP-IT 
®
and used the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) for cycle- sequencing. Sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer using capillary electrophoresis. We assembled cyt- 
b
sequences with CodonCode Aligner 4.1 and aligned them with ClustalW (
12 3
). The final cyt- 
b
alignment was 1,100bp long, indel- free and fully translatable. Mitochondrial sequences have been deposited with Genbank at accession numbers 
MN518858
- 
MN518862
.
</p>
            <p>
Population structure inference:
In order to test for the presence of geographic structuring across East Sulawesi, Peleng, and Taliabu, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the genomic SNP data. PCA was performed using ade4 (
12 4
) and factoextra (
12 5
), both available as R packages (
12 6
).
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial tree inference:
We constructed phylogenetic cyt- 
b
trees using two methods: maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML). We ran MP analyses using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
), performing 10,000 bootstrap replicates. For ML analyses, we first used jModelTest v2.1.6 (

97

) and determined that the Jukes-Cantor model (
12 8
) was the best performing substitution model. We then ran RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) using the extensive subtree-pruning-regrafting tree search algorithm.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic tree inference:
We applied three different genomic tree inference analyses: coalescent-based species tree inference (applied to the SNP dataset), maximum likelihood tree inference (applied to concatenated read supermatrix), and maximum parsimony tree inference (applied to the concatenated SNP dataset). We performed species tree inference using SNAPP (
1 29
) as implemented in BEAST 2.3.0, performing two iterations using default settings. Tracer 1.6 was used after each iteration to ensure that the runs had reached convergence, after which LogCombiner v2.3.0 and DensiTree (
13 0
) were used to process results. We carried out ML tree inference using RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) on the concatenated read supermatrix using the general-time-reversible gamma-invariant (GTRGAMMA) model and performed 1,000 rapid bootstrap searches. Finally, we conducted conventional MP analysis on the concatenated SNPs of each taxon set, using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
) and running 10,000 bootstrap replicates to evaluate branch support.

Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts are bronzy olive (2.5Y 3/4), the remiges and rectrices slightly darker and with more coppery edging (10YR 4/6). Dull white on breast reaches to chin, with an orange-rufescent tinge (7.5YR 7/6) surrounding the breast laterally and ventrally. Yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, with a rufescent-orange suffusion to flanks (7.5YR 7/6). Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Dark-horn mandible. Yellow-orange tarsus on live bird.

One of the phenotypically most distinct subspecies of the Mountain Tailorbird or Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Uniquely among all subspecies, the new taxon has a rufescent suffusion on throat and breast, becoming especially pronounced on breast sides and auriculars (from where it grades into the rufous crown), rendering the bird’s anterior aspect much warmer-tinged than all other subspecies. The upperparts, especially upper wings, are also warmer bronzy and the flanks tinged more rufescent than all other subspecies, making this the most reddish-looking taxon in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. It additionally differs from most other subspecies (except those from Sulawesi and Peleng) in the rufous crown’s more posterior extension to the nape and in the absence of a pale supercilium.
</p>
            <p>
It further differs from

(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis

malayanus

riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow on belly and lower breast (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near- complete absence of yellow, respectively). For additional differences from the new subspecies on Peleng, see SM8.

Davidson et al. (

<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoiler (then called an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird) for Taliabu, and characterized the population as inhabiting montane forest above 500m and possibly in need of taxonomic description. FER found this population commonly in disturbed montane forest to over 1,100 m, with a few records in dense secondary bamboo thickets down to 50m (

48

), and our collecting expedition re-encountered this form abundantly at elevations around 1,300m (

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, this new subspecies is currently only known from Taliabu in the Sula Archipelago. There, it inhabits disturbed situations (forest edge, bamboo thickets) mostly in the mountains, with the highest record at 1300m, but presumably ranging to the highest point at over 1400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). On other islands, mountain leaftoilers rarely range lower than ~500m (

57

), but Rheindt (

48

) exceptionally recorded the new taxon on Taliabu from an extensive bamboo thicket at ~50m, demonstrating that this population may tolerate lower elevations. The presence of this leaftoiler on the other two main Sula islands, Mangole and Sanana, is likely, especially on the former, which rises to over 1,100m, but perhaps also on the latter, which reaches to a little over 600m. However, it has probably been overlooked owing to a lack of fieldwork at higher elevations on these two islands. On the Banggai Archipelago, the species is represented by another novel subspecies (see below) that replaces 
sulanus
there. Its predilection for disturbed forest situations and wide elevational tolerance as compared to other insular mountain birds probably means that it is currently not of conservation concern.

Crown and nape rich rufous (2.5YR 4/10), slightly darker posteriorly, and not extending as far onto the nape as in the new Taliabu subspecies (
P. c. sulanus
; see SM7). Short blackish eyestripe. Facial region from auriculars to lores dusky-grey (N3) with an increasing rufous suffusion (concolorous with crown) towards the malar and moustachial regions. Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts olive with a slight bronzy hue (5Y 3/4), colder-colored than in the new subspecies from Taliabu (
P. c. sulanus
). Remiges and rectrices are darker and duskier, but with outer edging nearly concolorous with mantle. Underparts are bicolored, with a white chin to breast, and a lemon-yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, and with a dusky olive suffusion on the flanks. Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Tarsus dark-yellow. On the live bird, the upper mandible was black with a yellow tip, and the lower mandible was black with a yellow base and tip. The iris color was not clearly discerned on the live bird.

            <p>
A distinct new subspecies of Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(or ‘Mountain Tailorbird’), differing from adjacent subspecies to the east and to the west in important discrete characters.
</p>
            <p>
The lack of a supercilium and the posterior extension of the rufous crown coloration onto the mid-nape set this subspecies apart from most other subspecies, except those from Sulawesi and Taliabu, which have an equally or sometimes even slightly more extensive rufous crown. It further differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis
(Borneo), 
malayanus
(Malay Peninsula) and all subspecies further west and north in the absence of a strong grey hindcollar band and/or strongly grey breast sides; from 
<tp:taxon-name>
batjanensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(Bacan Island) in its lemon-yellow belly lacking a strong olive suffusion; and from 
dumasi
(Seram and Buru) in its much less brown-colored upperparts. In many aspects, the new taxon is similar to the set of subspecies on Sulawesi (
riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow belly (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near-complete absence of yellow, respectively).
</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies shares many unique traits with the new subspecies from Taliabu 
sulanus
(see SM7), but differs significantly in its darker chestnut crown and its less reddish overall appearance, largely lacking a rufescent suffusion to the breast and flanks, and showing much less rufescent on the auriculars; its flanks are also much colder olive-washed (versus warmly rufescent-washed), and the upperparts and especially upper wings are colder bronze-olive. On live birds, the legs are much darker and less intensely colorful than those of birds from Taliabu.

FER and Filip Verbelen first encountered and documented the new subspecies during a visit to the highlands of western Peleng between 22-31 March 2009 (

Typical of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers, this new taxon is restricted to forest edge situations, treefall gaps and bamboo thickets in montane forest on the island of Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago. During our combined visits to the island (

19
, 
49

), we recorded this new taxon from 750m to the highest point at over 1000m elevation. It may, therefore, not range as low as the new taxon from neighboring Taliabu, although future fieldwork may well produce lower elevational records. Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago is unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new subspecies. Despite its very small range, its predilection for disturbed forest situations probably means that it is not particularly negatively affected by the current degradation that is impacting most highland forests of western Peleng.

Taxonomic rationale (combined for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus sulanus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
P. c. relictus
)


</p>
            <p>
The Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
was previously thought to be an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird and then called Mountain Tailorbird. We here acknowledge the distant relationship to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbirds (
13 1
) and therefore follow the recent trend of calling members of this species ‘leaftoilers’ rather than tailorbirds [e.g. (

57

)], a fitting translation from their re- instated scientific genus name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
. As for the species name 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, we follow the recently proposed emendation (

6

) of the original spelling of the name (‘ 
cuculatus’
) on the basis of information in the original description showing that the name was meant to refer to the birds’ hooded appearance (from Latin cucullus – hood).
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: The new subspecies 
sulanus
from Taliabu is arguably one of the most distinctly-colored, if not the single most distinctly-colored subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(see Diagnosis) and is therefore well-deserving of subspecies status. Its reddish-suffused anterior body renders it instantly recognizable among any series of specimens. Although not as unique in morphology, we also describe 
relictus
from Peleng at the subspecific level mainly on the basis of its distinct coloration. In plumage distinctness, 
relictus
far exceeds several other previously recognized subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, such as 
P. c. cinereicollis
.
</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic evidence
: We have been unsuccessful in procuring a sufficiently large sample set of song recordings of the two new subspecies, precluding rigorous bioacoustic analysis. However, we note that the songs given by these two subspecies in the field did not strike us as very different from the songs of other subspecies we are familiar with. Song playback with recordings from several other islands elicited a ready response at least in 
P. c. relictus
. Based on our bioacoustic experience with Indonesian passerines, we do not have the impression that song differences of the two new subspecies would warrant anything but a subspecific treatment at the present time.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic evidence
: We created a set of ~8,500 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment of over 2 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase intron 2 (ND2) sequences, to investigate levels of differentiation among 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in a separate Methods paragraph below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three subspecies (
P. c. stentor
from eastern Sulawesi, 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng and 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population- genomic space (

). The main genomic division according to a PCA based on ~8,500 SNPs occurred between 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu versus the other two subspecies (PC1 in 

). In contrast to the leaf-warbler analysis (see SM6), this main genomic division among leaftoilers was also supported by the mitochondrial tree and the genomic ‘species tree’ (

), consistently placing 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng close to 
P. c. stentor
from Sulawesi, although the concatenated tree built from genome-wide loci was in conflict, placing 
P. c. relictus
closer to 
P. c. sulanus
. Coincidentally, the majority tree with a basal placement of 
sulanus
(topology 1 in 

) is also the arrangement that would be supported by the extraordinarily divergent plumage of 
sulanus
, making it unique among all leaftoiler subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
Pairwise divergences between the subspecies (as determined by ND2 distances) were relatively low (0.3-1.7%; 

), at levels generally accepted to be below the species threshold for birds [(~2-3%; (
100, 10 1
)], consistent with the current proposed subspecies status. These ND2 divergences further supported the majority tree (topology 1 in 

) by consistently rendering 
P. c. sulanus
as the most deeply diverged subspecies (up to ~1.7%), whereas 
P. c. relictus
and 
P. c. stentor
emerged as only 0.3% diverged.
</p>
            <p>
In summary, mitochondrial sequence analysis, PCA of genome-wide SNPs and ‘species-tree’ analysis all agree in placing 
P. c. sulanus
basal to the other two subspecies, an arrangement supported by its distinct plumage. Therefore, we have no reason to suspect bias in the mitochondrial divergence depth (unlike in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
, see SM6), which supports our bioacoustic assessment that both 
relictus
and 
sulanus
are at the subspecies level. Future studies of the uniquely colored 
P. c. sulanus
may yet challenge this assessment.
</p>
            <p>
Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted genomic DNA of all tissue material available for 
P. c. sulanus
(n=5) and 
P. c. relictus
(n=2), along with two samples of 
P. c. stentor
that we had independently collected on Mt Tumpu on the adjacent eastern Sulawesi peninsula (

19

). Tissue of a single individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cettia parens
</tp:taxon-name>
from Makira in the Solomon Islands, provided by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was also extracted to serve as an outgroup in phylogenomic rooting. Laboratory and analytical protocols followed our procedures outlined in SM6 (under 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
), utilizing the same reference genome (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
), but using a minimum stack depth of 5 in STACKS 1.34 and a minimum required locus coverage of 5 in pyRAD due to differences in sequencing quality. The final filtered dataset for the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers totaled 8,515 SNPs and the final concatenated read supermatrix was 2,002,726 bp long, generated from 13,194 separate loci. For mitochondrial analysis, we sequenced ND2 using the primers L5219Met and H6313Trp (
13 2
) with 35 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 50-53°C, but otherwise following the procedures as outlined in SM6. The final ND2 alignment for the leaftoilers was 1,015bp long, indel-free and fully translatable. All DNA data has been deposited with Genbank at accession number PRJNA566263 and 
MN518850

Hartert, 1920 (‘extremely neglected’) from Selayar Island, were based on the impression that the description of these birds had escaped the attention of researchers for too long. The presently described taxon, only discovered in the 21

century, fulfils that criterion even more adequately, so we take pleasure in naming it 
omississimus
(‘the most neglected’), superlative of ‘omissus’.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The immature plumage remains undocumented. The only two male specimens known to exist (holotype and MZB.Ornit.34.488) show minimal plumage variation, the only difference perhaps being the latter specimen’s slightly brighter, more brilliant rump and darker, more blackish tarsus and claws in life.</p>
            <p>As compared to males, the three female specimens have a duller blue supercilium (but still discernible), lack a black chin, have prominent rufous spectacles over a narrow blackish stripe through the cere, the rufous continuing to the lower sides of the face where it is finely speckled dark (in two of three females the speckling continues to the throat sides), and have much less dark blackish-blue auriculars, contrasting less with the rufous throat. The female’s upperparts are less brilliant blue. One of the three female specimens is slightly paler on the tarsus and claws.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new subspecies was first reported by Indrawan et al. (
13 3
), who documented the sighting of a female on 15 May 2001 and a male on 29 July 2001 at 50-100m elevation around Benteng on the main island of Togian, and pointed out that this new population may be an undescribed subspecies. Following their footsteps, Filip Verbelen (pers. comm.) made the first sound recordings of the new population in December 2008 when studying a few individuals on Kadidiri, a tiny forested tourist resort island off the coast of Togian measuring ~4km in length and less than 1km in width. A few days later, F. Verbelen moved to Batudaka, one of the three main islands of the archipelago, where he found additional individuals in coastal forest near the capital town of Wakai. FER visited Batudaka Island from 23-27 April 2009 and observed this new population. On our collecting trip, we visited Batudaka from 24-28 Dec 2013 and found this taxon to be common in the forests outside the capital town of Wakai, collecting the present material in the process (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>The new subspecies is known from the Togian Archipelago in the Gulf of Tomini, a satellite group of islands between the northern and eastern peninsulas of Sulawesi. More specifically, to the best of our knowledge the new subspecies has so far been found on the two main islands of Togian and Batudaka, as well as on the tiny islet of Kadidiri off Togian, where it is common in remnant forest and edge from near sea level to at least ~200m elevation. However, it is likely that the birds occur up to the highest elevations at ~430m on these islands. More field research is required to map this subspecies’ occurrence on other islands in this archipelago. Its presence on some of the larger, forest-covered islands in close proximity to Batudaka and Togian, such as Talatakoh, Waleakodi and Waleabahi, is virtually guaranteed, given its occurrence on tiny Kadidiri. However, its presence on slightly more distant islands, such as Puah (at ~18km from the main archipelago) and Unauna (at ~28km from the main archipelago) is less certain, although these latter islands are connected to the main archipelago by shallow sea-beds not exceeding 120m depth, indicating that they would have been connected with one another during glacial sea level recessions.</p>
            <p>
On the main island of Sulawesi, the newly described 
omississimus
is replaced by the nominate taxon 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Unusually, however, the nominate form on Sulawesi is a hill and montane forest denizen, occurring from 500-2300m elevation and shunning lowland forest habitats in stark contrast to the new subspecies.
</p>
            <p>The new subspecies appears to be moderately tolerant to habitat disturbance where small-scale timber extraction leads to a secondarization of primary forest. However, the taxon disappears where forest is converted into agricultural land. Although Togian’s forests are quickly dwindling, with most remnants by now secondary and restricted to inland locations away from the coast, far more than half of the islands should still be suitable for the new taxon, making it safe for the time being.</p>

            <p>
Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The proposed English name of this new taxon follows a recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] to call members of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
‘jungle-flycatchers’ rather than ‘blue-flycatchers’ because molecular data (
13 4
) and bioacoustic considerations (
57, 7 4
) strongly suggest a merger of many members of the previously recognized jungle-flycatcher genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinomyias
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Given that numerous species in the resultant genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
are no longer blue but entirely brown, the name ‘blue-flycatcher’, while formerly appropriate, is no longer suitable for this genus.
</p>
            <p>
Although distinguishable from other subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
in terms of plumage characters (see Diagnosis), 
omississimus
is quite similar to them in general coloration. At any rate, plumage coloration is not an ideal taxonomic indicator in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
jungle-flycatchers, many of which boast a highly conserved male plumage sporting blue upperparts and reddish underparts. Other characters, such as bioacoustic and genetic ones, may be more conducive to guiding taxonomic decision-making in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
We recently published a bioacoustic comparison on the basis of six vocal parameters among members of the greater 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, showing that the song of the newly described 
omississimus
from Togian exhibits considerable vocal overlap with the songs of all three analyzed subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
, while distinctly differing from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. kalaoensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[see 

in (
7 4
)]. This vocal evidence along with Togian’s proximity to Sulawesi suggest a placement of 
omississimus
as a subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Based on a lack of deep differentiation in both bioacoustic and genetic evidence, we propose to classify this new taxon at the subspecies level. Upon first discovery in the field, we were generally impressed by its lowland forest occurrence, which stands in contrast to the montane forest requirements of the nominate subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi. This pronounced difference in habitat preference was given much weight in supporting species- level recognition of the new Togian population in a recently published field guide to the region (

57

). However, given Gwee et al.’s (
7 4
) newly published data, the latter treatment has ultimately proved erroneous.

in its lack of solid white or rufous on the belly; its uniform dark-brown coloration in which only the underparts show a faint warm tinge; and its unmarked dark-brown vent. The new subspecies has a darker hood and breast than the above-mentioned taxa except for the intensely rufous-bellied 
fumidus
and perhaps 
hygroscopus
. It also differs from 
deningeri
from Seram in its paler, browner (less black) body color, with a darker non-contrasting hood, and differs from 
schlegelii
and 
sterlingi
(both from Timor) in its less olive overall coloration and lack of rufous belly and vent.
</p>
            <p>
Within Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely resembles the much larger and longer-winged 
versteegi
and 
papuensis
from Papua but is dark slaty-brown (versus black) in overall body color and has an unmarked vent. The lower underparts have more extensive and paler-cinnamon feather margins in the new subspecies versus narrower, more rufous feather margins in the Papuan forms.
</p>
            <p>
Among geographically more distant Island Thrush subspecies from outside of Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely approaches three taxa from the Solomon Islands (
bougainvillei, kulambangrae, sladeni)
and two taxa from the Bismarck Archipelago (
heinrothi, beehleri
), but lacks those subspecies’ blackish overall body color. It also superficially resembles 
nigrorum
from Negros (Philippines), but the latter subspecies’ lower belly grades into whitish on the vent while the new subspecies is uniformly dark on those parts. Furthermore, another Philippine subspecies, 
kelleri
from Mt Apo (Mindanao), is similar to the new subspecies but becomes darker brown towards the front of the head while the new subspecies has a nearly uniform head coloration becoming slightly paler on the forehead.

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The subspecies name, translated from Bahasa Indonesia “it likes the rain” (=suka hujan), refers to the circumstances surrounding the bird’s discovery. On FER’s first expedition to the highest parts of Taliabu (

48

), heavy persistent rain impeded bird observations, leading to a decision to abort the expedition ahead of schedule. On his premature descent, FER then spotted a hardy individual of the new thrush, perched in the pouring rain, leading him to change plans yet again and mount a subsequent second and eventually third expedition to these elevations in better weather. This latter third expedition then allowed for a more detailed documentation of Taliabu’s distinct novel montane avifauna (

19
, 
48

). The name 
sukahujan
is treated as an inalienable noun in apposition.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>All nine specimens procured resemble one another considerably in coloration. The greatest variation occurs in the tone of the lower breast and abdomen, which is intermediate in the holotype but ranges from all-drab brownish grey throughout with almost no warm edging (in MZB.Ornit.34.416) to more extensive cinnamon feather edging (in most adult females, especially MZB.Ornit.34.409), the latter leading to an overall warmer underparts impression. Females are variably slightly less slaty on upperparts and crown, and one adult individual (MZB.Ornit.34.416) of unknown sex has a male-like slaty tone on upperparts but a female- like crown color that is more suffused with dull brown. Two juveniles (MZB.Ornit.34.410; MZB.Ornit.34.417) exhibit noticeable mottling on their mantle and underparts coloration, caused by dark brownish-black feather margins contrasting against the paler (on underparts sometimes warm cinnamon) feather centers.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new taxon was first discovered on 8 and 9 April 2009 by FER near its type locality on the occasion of a hike to the highest elevations on Taliabu that was cut short by heavy rainfall. Subsequent sightings on 14 and 15 April 2009 were made in the same area on the occasion of a return visit (

48

). We found this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected the type along with the accompanying specimens.

<tp:taxon-name>
T. poliocephalus

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
With approximately 50 subspecies, the Island Thrush 
<tp:taxon-name>
Turdus poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
is arguably the most polytypic bird species on Earth (
13 5
). Attempts to separate this variable species complex into smaller species-level lineages [e.g. (
13 6
)] have been called into question by genetic data showing that plumage characters are not a good predictor of close relationships in this complex (
13 7
). Hence, modern sources generally continue to unite all or most subspecies into one polytypic species. Not unlike some Philippine subspecies previously under study (
13 7
), the new subspecies from Taliabu is phenotypically extremely different from neighboring forms but more closely resembles certain geographically distant subspecies. It is presently best accommodated at the subspecies level. Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic inquiries are needed in the future to assess whether any internal species limits must be drawn within the complex. Such future analyses may well elevate the Taliabu Island Thrush to species level. However, such analyses are currently hampered by a lack of crucial comparative DNA material.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Forehead to crown and nape dark slaty blue (2.5PB 2/2) with slightly scaly appearance generated through narrow black feather centres; the same color, but without the scaly appearance, then continues through mantle and scapulars to rump. A white supercilium starts above the centre of the eye and ends just shy of the bill base, becoming narrower towards the front. A black facial patch centred in the loral region and below the supercilium to the chin (with narrow rows of black feathers above the bill base) grades into dark slaty blue coloration (2.5PB 1.5/2) towards the auriculars and the malar and moustachial regions, merging with the nape and mantle. Upperwing coverts largely concolorous with crown, with vestiges of an extremely indistinct brighter carpal patch visible with difficulty on this specimen. Remiges are dark slaty brown (10YR 2.5/1), the larger primaries with warmer, paler outer edging (10YR 4/2). Breast intensely rufous (7.5YR 7/12), becoming slightly paler on throat and upper flanks, and becoming pale cinnamon-whitish on belly and lower flanks (7.5YR 9/4), and eventually off-white on undertail coverts. Tail dull black on upper side, blackish-grey (N2) on underside, with indistinct white base to outermost rectrices. Iris dark-brown; legs light-pink; black bill with pinkish gape flange on live bird.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
An unequivocal member of the Snowy-browed Flycatcher 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ficedula hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
, and one of its most easterly outposts, with minor plumage distinctions in the male and major plumage distinctions in the female, a combination of which conclusively demarcates this new taxon from other subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
The male subtly differs from adjacent insular subspecies to the south and to the west, namely from the two Sulawesi subspecies (
jugosae, annalisa
), from 
sumatrana
(Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo), from 
vulcani
(Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores), and from 
alifura
(Buru), in the reduction of white patches at the base of the outer tail feathers, and in the slightly less extensive rufous underparts, replaced on the belly by pale cinnamon- whitish. In contrast, males of the only subspecies to the east and north (
pallidipectus
from Bacan Island) are markedly paler on the underparts than the males of this new subspecies, and have more contrastingly olive flanks. The white supercilium in males of the new subspecies is narrower than that of at least 
sumatrana, vulcani
, and 
alifura
.
</p>
            <p>
The female is highly distinct from most subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
in her bluish (versus olive, brown or grey-brown) upperparts coloration, extensive cold-brown mottling on breast (versus little to none), and a washed-out face pattern ghosting that of the male, with a whiter (versus rufous) brow. The only other subspecies that equals female 
F. h. betinabiru
in her bluish tinge to the upperparts is 
alifura
from adjacent Buru, in which the back color is ever so slightly brighter-blue. Compared to the new subspecies, the female of 
alifura
exhibits a more rufous (less white) eye brow, and brighter and more extensive rufous underparts with less brown mottling.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>
Only adult specimens have been procured, although a photo of a 
pullus
near the nest suggests an early juvenile plumage similar to other subspecies. Among adults, tarsus color as recorded in the field on live birds appears to vary individually from light-pink to pinkish-horn.
</p>
            <p>There is minor variation among the nine adult male specimens procured in the lower extent of the rufous breast, the intensity of the cinnamon wash to the belly, thickness of the supercilium and the extent of vestigial white patches on the basal outer rectrices. There is minor variation among the five adult female specimens in the intensity of brown mottling on the underparts, width and paleness of the supercilium and the presence or absence of a slight brownish tinge to the lowermost mantle portion.</p>

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies of Snowy-browed Flycatcher was first encountered by the University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 (
64, 9 8
). Members of that survey found the new taxon predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m) and suggested that it may be a novel subspecies. FER then saw one adult male at 1100m during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu on 5 April 2009 (

48

). We returned to this general area between 6-16 December 2013, where we found 
betinabiru
as one of the most common constituents of the forest interior understorey avifauna and collected the type and accompanying individuals at ~1300m (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
Subspecies 
betinabiru
is currently only known from the understorey of dense montane forest in the highlands of Taliabu at above 800m elevation (
19, 48, 64, 9 8
). Extensive logging has occurred across the highlands of Taliabu, with some parts of the mountains additionally affected by large-scale forest fires (see Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler account in SM3; 

). As an understory inhabitant, 
betinabiru
would be particularly susceptible to this kind of habitat degradation and is therefore probably declining. Nevertheless, it remains extremely common where good habitat persists, as indicated by our high mistnet capture rates (

19

).
</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, Snowy-browed Flycatchers have not been detected on the two other main islands of the Sula Archipelago, although their occurrence is possible at least on Mangole, which rises to 1,127m, while very unlikely on Sanana, which does not rise taller than ~600m. If confirmed on Mangole, it is likely that the local population would refer to the same subspecies 
betinabiru
.
</p>
            <p>
On the adjacent Banggai Archipelago, a single Snowy-browed Flycatcher was recorded once in April 2009 at 800-900m on the tallest island of Peleng (

49

). To the best of our knowledge, there have not been subsequent records from this island despite extensive fieldwork. In the absence of photos or closer details about the single Peleng record, it is impossible to ascertain whether the Peleng population is ascribable to 
betinabiru
, to one of the two Sulawesi races (
annalisa, jugosae
) or to a novel unnamed subspecies.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We describe this new taxon on the basis of its characteristic plumage (especially in females). These plumage distinctions certainly warrant a description at the subspecific level as they exceed those of several more poorly marked subspecies within this complex (e.g. 
annalisa
[Stresemann, 1931], which only subtly differs from 
jugosae
[Riley, 1921]). Bioacoustic variation in this species complex is poorly explored, but the high-pitched courtship vocalization of the new subspecies superficially resembles that of many other subspecies, and playback of songs from other subspecies elicits a ready response from members of this population. Genetic differences between the new taxon and other subspecies remain unexplored.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Crown, nape, ear coverts and neck sides are mid-brown (7.5YR 4/2), with a distinct cinnamon-chestnut forehead extending over eye (7.5YR 4/8). Black rictal bristles. Nape color slowly grading into warmer cinnamon-rufous (2.5YR 4/10) across mantle, scapulars and rump to the basal 60% portion of tail. The outer remiges are mostly dark dusky-brown (7.5YR 2/1), becoming paler and more olive-brown (7.5YR 4/2) towards the inner remiges. All remiges have narrow but intense rufous outer edging concolorous with rump and lower back color. The wing coverts are almost identical to the inner remiges in color, with an increasing intensity and width of bright-rufous feather tipping towards the median and lesser coverts. The distal 40% of the tail is greyish-black (N2), with paler rufous tips (5YR 5/6) on the underside only. Chin and throat form a white triangle delimited below by a conspicuous large black breast patch. A diffuse band of grey coloration (N5) with a black scaly appearance created by black feathers with narrow grey edging demarcates the black breast patch on its lower side. The belly is pale buff (7.5YR 9/8), grading into a richer, fuller hue on the flanks and undertail coverts (7.5YR 5/6). The iris is dark-brown, the bill black with a pinkish base to the lower mandible, and the tarsus on the live bird was described as pinkish- horn.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A mid-sized, rufous-toned 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura
</tp:taxon-name>
typical of a radiation of fantails distributed throughout Australasia. It most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
(

57

), and constitutes the third member of this radiation. Its plumage distinctions from the other two species are subtle yet consistent. However, the most characteristic distinction is its unique courtship vocalization (
7 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, the new species differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Sula Islands in its much narrower, less distinct rufous tips to the underside of the rectrices, in its more distinct black scaling below the black breast patch, and in its more strongly cinnamon-buff (less white) central underparts. The new species’ throat is cleaner white, less interspersed with dusky tips to the feathers.
</p>
            <p>
The new species differs from all three subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi in its wider black portion of the tail and its warmer brown crown and upper mantle. When compared to the geographically most closely adjacent subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni toradja
</tp:taxon-name>
from eastern and central Sulawesi, the new species additionally differs in its cleaner white throat and slightly less conspicuous scaling below the black breast patch, while it is additionally distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
of the Lompobattang Massif in South Sulawesi by its blacker breast patch and by the richer chestnut (less cinnamon) coloration of its brighter body parts (such as supercilium, rear upperparts, flanks and vent).

Etymology

</p>
            <p>The new species’ epithet is in honor of the late Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie (deceased 11 Sep 2019), the third president of the Republic of Indonesia. President Habibie was known as a keen environmentalist and contributed greatly to the science and conservation of nature in Indonesia.</p>

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The only three specimens (all adult; one female, two males) exhibit limited variation in terms of extent of breast patch and black mottling below breast patch that may have been caused by the preparation of the specimens.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new species has doubtless been known to the local inhabitants of Peleng Island for a long time. Mochamad Indrawan was presumably the first outside ornithologist to see this new bird when encountering a dead individual during his work on Peleng in the mid-2000s and re- encountering the species in the wild on several undated occasions (

49

). During a field trip between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently observed the species near the type locality (

49

), where we returned from 18-23 Dec 2013 to collect the type and the accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new species is restricted to montane forest on the island of Peleng, the largest landmass in the Banggai Archipelago, at elevations not lower than 750m (

19
, 
49

) (

). Over two longer visits to the highlands of Peleng, we found that the species becomes gradually more common towards higher elevations before it seems to drop out somewhere slightly below the tallest peak on Peleng at 1,022m. The new species is replaced on Sulawesi to the west by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
, and on the Sula Archipelago to the east by 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Its occurrence on other islands of the Banggai Archipelago is highly unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
must be considered threatened given the small extent of its occurrence and the continuing loss of its habitat. Only 25,071 ha of land on Peleng fall above the approximate 750m elevational cutoff, most of it formerly constituting a single contiguous block of highland forest (

). However, our own observations in combination with satellite imagery indicate extensive forest loss to small-scale agriculture and logging by burgeoning village communities. Google Earth’s present coverage of the area is mixed, with large swathes covered by insufficient or outdated (e.g., 2004) imagery. However, given current satellite coverage, a conservative estimate is that 9,987 ha (~40%) from within the elevational range of

have either been completely deforested or constitute young regrowth or unviable forest fragments surrounded by clearings. This would leave only 15,084 ha of more or less undisturbed primary or older secondary forest. Recent observations indicate, however, that this extent of forest loss is probably an underestimate. After the first discovery of this species and a number of other new bird taxa on Peleng (

49

), the island became a destination for an average of 1-3 international adventure and birdwatching tour groups per year, which considerably helped spur the local economy of the village near the type locality (name withheld). While this sort of ecotourism has a positive impact on the natural environment in many reported cases, on Peleng the sudden influx of tourist dollars led to observations of increased logging and expansion of infrastructure, prompting the rapid destruction of forest at the original type locality over the last five years. In the near future, it will be of paramount importance for the survival of Peleng’s unique montane fauna to find ways in which the influx of eco-tourism dollars can create incentives for conservation.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
Based on its plumage coloration, the new species is clearly a member of the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, hitherto known from Sulawesi and the Sula Archipelago (

57

). The discovery of a new constituent of this radiation on the Banggai Archipelago closes the geographic gap between Sulawesi and Sula. Most previous taxonomic treatises (e.g. 
6 1, 7 5
) have regarded all members of this radiation as conspecific, and indeed plumage differences are relatively minor and have long been interpreted as consistent with a subspecific treatment. However, recent research into patterns of bioacoustic and genomic differentiation among rusty-bellied fantails from Sulawesi, Sula and Banggai has produced strong evidence in favor of species level treatment of all three island populations (
7 2
).

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="biology_ecology">
            <p>
Vocalizations
: Bioacoustically, the courtship vocalization (=song) of the new species from Peleng is the most distinct of any member of the radiation. A detailed characterization of this song has been published elsewhere (

49

). In fact, when we first found the species in the field, the bird stood out through its unusual, simple descending song that lacks the typical complex tinkling quality of its congeners (

49

). Quantitative bioacoustic comparisons revealed that the unusual vocal features of the new Peleng species have led to an acoustic leapfrog pattern in rusty-bellied fantails in which the two terminal (=easternmost and westernmost) species (i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) are more similar to each other in courtship vocalizations but are geographically divided by the new species with its unusual song (
7 2
). The great vocal distinctness of the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
is surprising because it belies its geographic proximity to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
(Sulawesi)
</tp:taxon-name>
across a combined lowland and sea gap of less than 40km and its frequent land connection to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
(Taliabu)
</tp:taxon-name>
across Pleistocene land bridges during times of global cooling (

49

). Vocal behavior is known to be an important feature in species cohesion and reproductive isolation in songbirds (
7 6, 77
), and has been shown to be more important as an indicator of species limits than plumage traits in some passerine lineages (

78

). Therefore, recent authors have accepted the unmistakable vocal uniqueness of the new Peleng fantail as an indication of its status as an undescribed new species (
57, 7 2
).

Genomic data
: In a previously published analysis (
7 2
), we conducted a comparison of&gt;11,000 genome-wide markers with a complete representation among 16 individuals spanning all three species within the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. In this analysis, the new species from Peleng emerged as most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (both subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
toradja
) and less closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sula. This phylogenomic result is significant considering that – among all pairwise vocal comparisons – the greatest bioacoustic differentiation is found between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and the new species, with strong vocal distinctions in both non-courtship vocalizations and courtship songs (
7 2
). Therefore, the relatively shallowest genomic differentiation among the three island populations corresponds to the deepest bioacoustic divergence.
</p>
            <p>
Although the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
emerged as most closely related within the radiation, comparisons of genome-wide data allow for the designation of both taxa as independent species: the basal split between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other taxa is mainly based on a genomic signal contained in ~20% of the genetic variance across study loci, whereas the second most dominant genomic signature – contained in ~14% of the genetic variance across markers – predominantly represents the deep divergence between the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
[

in (
7 2
)]. The presence of a significant proportion of genomic locus cohorts displaying deep differentiation between the new species and either of its two neighbors was in agreement with gene flow analyses (‘ABBA-BABA tests’) that pointed to a history of rare introgression between the new species and its neighbors (
7 2
), perhaps during episodes of unusual climate forcing dispersal between islands. Such secondary introgression is not unusual among congeneric bird species (

79

) and is not in conflict with species level treatment.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>
The entire crown from forehead to nape is rich earthen-brown (7.5YR 3/3) with slightly darker feather margins creating a scalloped appearance. A thin off-white supercilium is pronounced from bill base to just behind eye, from where it slowly tapers out. Lores are dark brownish-black (2.5Y 1.5/1). Ear coverts are of a medium earthen-brown tone (5YR 3/1) with fine pale shaft streaks giving a grizzled appearance, grading into a more greyish-brown tone (10YR 6/1) in the moustachial and malar region. The mantle and scapulars down to the uppertail coverts are largely concolorous with the crown but lack the scalloping created by darker feather margins. The remiges are mostly a rich cold dark-brown (2.5YR 2/1) but have warmer outer webs concolorous with mantle. The upperwing coverts are similarly two-toned, being mostly concolorous with mantle but some showing darker outer webs concolorous with most of remiges. As typical for the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
, the rectrices are narrow and dark- brown, very close in color to the remiges (2.5YR 2/1). The tail feathers are mostly worn, although one in the centre appears to be a new replacement.
</p>
            <p>The white chin and throat are quite sharply demarcated from the face. The lower throat and upper breast, still white, are interspersed with fine dusky speckling increasing towards the breast and lower throat sides where the color grades into a solid mid-grey (N5) with only few inconspicuous dusky speckles. The grey breast color then grades into a tawny- ochraceous belly color (7.5YR 4/6), first through tracts of grey feathers which have warm- ochraceous edging, then through tracts of largely ochraceous feathers that still have a grey feather centre, eventually to all-ochraceous feathers. The belly color becomes darker and richer on the undertail coverts and flanks (7.5YR 3/4).</p>
            <p>The bill is black with an inconspicuous paler tip. The gape on the live bird was slightly enlarged light yellow. The iris is dark brown. The tarsus and toes were described on the live bird as maroon-horn with paler, more yellowish toepads.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A rich dark-brown forest warbler typical of the montane resident 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. As is usual across this cryptic genus, the new taxon is most conspicuous not on the basis of its plumage but its vocalizations.
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, it is most similar in size and shape to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
of Sulawesi. However, in comparison to the new taxon, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
has less distinct speckling on the breast, has a more uniform crown that is less scalloped, paler and warmer brown upperparts, greyer underparts with brown mostly only on flanks, and has a less pointed, wider tail.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram differs in its less distinct central breast spotting, greyer (less whitish) supercilium, and more extensive grey on breast reaching further onto upper breast, neck sides and auriculars.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru differs in its much whiter breast, with off-white reaching onto mid-belly, whereas only the lower flanks and lower belly are warm-brown. Although the central breast of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
has a mid-grey tinge, its underparts are much paler than the new species’ fairly uniform grey lower breast, which grades into a fairly dark homogeneous warm-brown belly.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is quite different from the smaller 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. montis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Java. The latter is much paler cinnamon-brown on upperparts, crown and especially remiges and rectrices, and is uniformly buff-white below with extensive dark-brown speckling from chin to upper belly, lacking the new species’ grey tones on the breast and dark warm-brown tones on the belly.

The name 
<tp:taxon-name>
portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
– past participle of Latin ‘portendere’ – roughly translates as “the predicted one” or “the foretold one” and relates to the unusual circumstances of discovery when FER first heard the new warbler and recognized it to be a novel species of

multiple days before a visual confirmation was obtained.

            <p>Currently only one adult specimen is available (i.e., the holotype), and photos of up to two more adults suggest that this is probably a sexually monomorphic species with limited plumage variation.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
FER was the first person to discover 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on 9 April 2009 near its type locality when he heard an unmistakable insect-like sound that he attributed to a hitherto unnamed taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
grasshopper-warbler. Having been exposed to the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on a visit to Sulawesi only two weeks prior, and having had previous field experience with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru and Seram, respectively (
8 0
), FER was aware that the song of this population – albeit superficially reminiscent of the others – is distinct at the species level. Even so, because of the retiring nature of this bird and ill-timed heavy rain, it took FER another two hiking expeditions to the highlands of Taliabu to finally confirm on 15 April 2009 that this song was indeed uttered by what he perceived as an “unusually dark” individual of grasshopper-warbler (

48

). We encountered this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected a single specimen, now the holotype.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is presumably restricted to montane forest at the highest elevations of the island of Taliabu (

19
, 
48

) (

). All our records are from elevations above 1,050m on the more mountainous western half of the island of Taliabu, which reaches its highest altitude of ~1,415m at an unnamed peak near our collection locality (

). The new species inhabits a peculiar type of dwarf montane forest typical of these elevations.
</p>
            <p>
The occurrence of the new species on neighboring islands is highly doubtful. Of the three major islands that form the Sula archipelago, Taliabu is the largest and tallest. The smallest main island, Sanana, barely reaches above 600m elevation. The highest elevation on its larger neighbor Mangole is 1,127m – theoretically within the elevational range of this grasshopper-warbler – but the area of land above 1,050m on Mangole is only ~36 ha, which is too small an area to allow for the survival of a highly montane bird species throughout evolutionary time scales. On the neighboring Banggai archipelago, the situation is similar: the only island high enough to allow for the theoretical possibility of grasshopper-warbler breeding occurrence is Peleng (highest elevation ~1,022m), but extensive fieldwork around this highest area has not revealed the presence of any resident grasshopper-warblers (

19
, 
49

).
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
must be a rare bird: Taliabu’s area above 1,050m amounts to ~16,690 ha of formerly forested land in the interior of the island’s western half, over 97% of which forms one contiguous block (

). However, satellite imagery predominantly from 2004 indicates that a total of ~1,023 ha (~6.1%) of this area had been affected by logging operations that have degraded the forest and removed its undercover, presumably rendering the affected areas unsuitable, or nearly so, for the grasshopper-warbler. In the one-and-a-half decades since the satellite images were obtained, extensive additional logging is likely to have occurred. Another 940 ha (~5.6%) of the area above 1,050m have succumbed to a series of catastrophic forest fires in 1982 and 1983, and now constitute open grassland habitat unsuitable for this warbler (

). Our surveys showed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
does not occur in the extensive recently generated grasslands in the highlands of Taliabu (

48

). This leaves 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
with less than 15,000 ha of suitable habitat, an area likely to further diminish in size with ongoing habitat destruction and the impacts of global warming leading to an upward elevational shift of habitat zones.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We include this new taxon within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
following the phylogenetic demonstration that the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bradypterus
</tp:taxon-name>
(previously used for this Southeast Asian clade of warblers) is restricted to Africa (
8 1, 8 2
). Its inclusion within 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
is the reason why we follow the recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] of using the English moniker ‘grasshopper-warbler’ rather than the term ‘bush-warbler’, which is more appropriately reserved for members of a radiation in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Cettiidae</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
is renowned for its cryptic and conservative coloration that has confounded plumage-based classifications for decades and led to delays in the recognition of species-level taxa until bioacoustic and molecular methods have been applied (
8 3, 8 4
). In Wallacea, members of a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from Sulawesi and the Moluccas were previously united into a single polytypic species 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
(
6 1, 7 5
), but have recently been divided into three constituent island species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru, on the basis of their strikingly different songs (

57

). Our new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is geographically surrounded by constituents of this radiation and is a member of it both on the basis of morphological characters (see Diagnosis) and bioacoustic ones.
</p>
            <p>
Although plumage distinctions are not as important in the genus, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by comparatively unique, dark-brown upperparts that stand in contrast to the generally paler and warmer-brown upperparts of neighboring species. However, we mainly attribute species status to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on the basis of its unique song and genetic differentiation. We here provide an excerpt of ongoing analyses as relating to the bioacoustic and mitogenomic differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from neighboring species.

Bioacoustic evidence
: A total of 41 suitable, high-quality, homologous 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
song recordings from the field were gathered for analysis from various sources, encompassing all three previous species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation plus the new species. These recordings were measured for 11 suitable bioacoustic parameters, and resultant measurements were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and a conservative vocal diagnosability criterion (

85

), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Further details regarding all analyzed recordings, such as GPS locations, dates, times, and names of recordists, are listed in table S3, while more details on bioacoustic methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
Based on the Isler Criterion, eight out of eleven song parameters measured were diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and two other taxa: 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (table S4). Four out of eleven parameters were Isler-diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (table S4). The ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) can be adopted to ascertain if the level of vocal divergence between these archipelagic taxa is comparable in magnitude to divergences across unequivocal species-level divisions. When comparing Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler song against that of the Friendly Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
, a geographically distant species from montane Borneo that has never been included in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, only two parameters emerged as Isler-diagnosable (table S4). Using this result as a yardstick for what constitutes species level vocal differentiation, the magnitude of vocal divergence between Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
on Seram, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
on Buru, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on Sulawesi is extremely high, indicating they all have diagnosably distinct vocalizations that are best reflected in species rank.
</p>
            <p>
Principal component analysis of the vocal measurements underscores the vocal distinctness of Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from the other three Wallacean species (

). A cumulative proportion of variance of 73.3% is accounted for in the first two principal components, suggesting a strong vocal differentiation between Taliabu and the remaining taxa (

).
</p>
            <p>
Mitogenomic evidence
: Using whole-genome sequencing and laboratory approaches for the use of ancient DNA, we created an alignment of whole-mitochondrial sequences spanning ~15,000 base pairs (bp) across 11 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals belonging to all four constituent island forms of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, and used three different phylogenetic tree-building methodologies to investigate relationships and levels of divergence. More details on the methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
All three phylogenetic trees produced indicated identical topologies with high bootstrap support (

), suggesting that the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is an independent lineage most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (mitogenomic divergence ~2%), and much more distantly related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (divergence ~4.8–5%) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (divergence ~7.7–8%). Mitogenomic divergences roughly correlate with those from the COI barcoding gene, although they do not have to be equal in magnitude.
</p>
            <p>
Integrating the vocal and mitogenomic evidence, it is clear that bioacoustic differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, the two species which emerged most closely related on the mitogenomic tree (

), far exceed those between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and a geographically distant species (
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
) that has never been closely associated with the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. Our combined evidence therefore supports the treatment of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
as a well-diverged small-insular endemic species.

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic sampling:
We obtained 41 homologous recordings, which were either recorded by us in the field, or privately sourced from avid field ornithologists (including Robert O. Hutchinson and Ross Gallardy), or collected from publicly accessible online databases, namely the Avian Vocalization Center (AVoCet at http://avocet. integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu), the Xeno-Canto Sound Library (www.xeno-canto.org), the Macaulay Sound Library (www.macaulaylibrary.org), and the Internet Bird Collection (www.hbw.com/ibc).
</p>
            <p>Although slight variation in recording quality exists in the equipment used, inspection and comparison of spectrograms from different devices showed that this variation is comparable to that amongst recordings made by one sole recordist using the same device. In addition, although there is some variability in background noise, spectrogram inspection suggested that measurements of vocalizations would not be affected. Measurements of the recordings were performed using the program Raven Pro Version 1.5 (Bioacoustics Research Program, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA) on its default settings. The following eleven parameters were chosen for bioacoustic analysis, with each parameter averaged over all the measurements across one recording:</p>

Bioacoustic analysis:
The vocal diagnosability criterion outlined by Isler et al. (
8 5
), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, was used to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Besides other oscine passerines (
73, 8 6
), this criterion has been employed as a bioacoustic species delimitation method across Asian birds such as owls (

58
, 
87

), pigeons (

50
, 
52
, 
88

), and nightjars (

89

). The Isler criterion has two parts which must be fulfilled in order to infer diagnosability. Firstly, the range of measurements of a parameter between two taxa must not exhibit overlap, and secondly, the data have to satisfy the following equation: 
xa
+ 
taSDa ≤xb–tbSDb,
where (
x
) refers to the respective means of measurements in taxon a and b, and 
ti
refers to the t-score at the 95th percentile of the t distribution for 
n-1
degrees of freedom. This is a stricter statistical test than the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (
8 5
) as it employs the standard deviation of the sample points instead of the taxon mean, allowing for the diagnosis of distinctions between taxa under more rigorous conditions. Successful Isler diagnosability is defined here as the presence of at least one vocally diagnostic parameter between taxa.

DNA extraction methods:
Fresh tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
was DNA- sequenced along with the following number of toepad scrapings of historical museum specimens: three of the Buru Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, three of the Seram Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and four of the Sulawesi Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
. All museum samples had been kindly contributed by the American Museum of Natural History (for voucher numbers, see 

and table S5). DNA extraction was carried out with the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extraction of the historic museum specimens’ toepad scrapings was conducted by trained personnel (CYG) in a room dedicated to ancient DNA extraction to preclude DNA contamination. The toepads were rinsed with water four times before extraction to ensure preservatives were removed, and DTT was added to facilitate digestion of keratin present in toepads. The concentrations of the DNA extracts were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay.
</p>
            <p>
DNA sequencing methods:
The holotype’s DNA extract was sheared into smaller fragments of ~250 base pairs (bp) using 13 cycles of 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off on a Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode, USA). Whole-genome library preparation for the holotype was carried out using a NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, USA) for Illumina according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the museum toepad extracts, the shearing step was omitted as the ancient DNA is already degraded and NEBNext FFPE DNA repair mix (New England Biolabs, USA) was added to each ancient DNA sample prior to library preparation to fix damage common to degraded DNA such as deamination, nicks and gaps. In addition, size selection of library preparation products was omitted for the toepad samples to reduce DNA loss from bead selection. A total of five PCR cycles were run on the holotype’s DNA extract and 12 PCR cycles on the toepads’ extracts. Whole-genome library preparation of toepad samples was carried out in a room with a PCR hood dedicated to ancient library preparation work. The concentrations and peak fragment sizes of the libraries were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay and an Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer (Agilent, USA), respectively. The peak fragment sizes of the historic museum samples and the fresh holotype (including adaptors and unique indexes) were ~230bp and ~380bp, respectively. All prepared libraries were sent to NovogeneAIT Genomics Singapore for Illumina sequencing using a HiSeq 4000 platform to produce 150bp paired-end reads.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial genome alignment
: Trimmomatic (version 0.33) (

90

) was used to remove adaptors and filter low quality reads (below 15 Phred quality score). We applied the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (version 0.7.15-r1140) (
9 1
) to align reads to a mitochondrial reference genome, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella pryeri
</tp:taxon-name>
(Genbank accession no.: NC_029151), with a minimum mapping quality score of 30. Samtools (version 1.9) (
9 2, 9 3
) was run to convert the SAM output files from the alignment to a BAM format for downstream analysis. Then Picard (version 2.18.21; http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) was employed to insert read groups and remove PCR duplicate artifacts. The BAM files were then imported into CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0.4 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com) for remapping to the same reference genome using the following mapping parameters: mismatch penalty of 1, insertion penalty of 1, and deletion penalty of 1. The reads were locally realigned at indel regions, and the consensus sequences were extracted at a minimum coverage threshold of 100. A mapping summary produced by Qualimap (version 2.2.1) (
9 4
) indicated that our mitochondrial genome coverage ranged between ~290–2920x for museum samples and ~6430x for the holotype (table S5). Sequences are deposited with GenBank at accession numbers 
MN597052
- 
MN597062
.
</p>
            <p>
Phylogenetic analysis
: The consensus sequences were exported in FASTA format and visually realigned in MEGA7 (

95

), producing a final whole-mitochondrial alignment of ~15,000bp. MEGA7 was used to construct a neighbor-joining tree based on uncorrected p- divergences and a maximum parsimony tree. Additionally, we ran raxmlGUI 1.5 beta (

96

) to construct a maximum likelihood tree using the GTRGAMMA model as specified by jModelTest (version 2.1.7) (

97

). All tree-building analyses were conducted with 10,000 bootstrap replicates. Pairwise uncorrected p-divergences across the mitogenomic alignment were calculated in MEGA7 with 10,000 bootstrap replicates.

            <p>Head and mantle down to uppertail coverts and to central belly are bright scarlet-red (7.5R 4/14) with subtle blackish suffusion owing to individual feathers having broad red distal half followed by black and then increasingly greyish basal half; jet-black narrow orbital ring and loral line. Upperwings, sides of mantle, scapulars and rectrices are matt black, with the remiges appearing slightly duskier black because of narrow olive edging to outer webs; underwing coverts and outer webs of the underside of remiges are whitish; a blackish-grey (N1.5) wedge extends from vent up to central belly.

The diagnosis refers to the adult male plumage only. Female 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals of the Wallacean radiation are generally very similar across species, and more research is needed to identify good distinguishing marks.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is an obvious, bright scarlet-and-black representative of the Wallacean grouping of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters that have often been united within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
complex (
6 1, 7 5
), but have been considered a radiation of independent species by more recent authors [e.g. (

57

)]. Within this radiation, the new species most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species has a more extensive and brighter red body and blacker wings, scapulars, and tail. Scarlet feathers in the new species are mostly black and grey at the base, with only the distal half scarlet, and with a sharp contrast between scarlet and black, lacking 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
’s narrow yellow bands in between the red and black portions of each individual feather that render the latter’s overall body more orange-tinted. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the red is not as extensive on the underparts, and the abdomen and vent are paler buff-white versus blackish-grey in the new species.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species is paler and greyer (not black) on vent and abdomen. It also has a smudgier scarlet body coloration (caused by the black and grey basal halves of individual feathers), with dark smudges especially pronounced on face and on breast sides, as compared to more uniform red underparts, head and mantle in 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
. Black lores in the new species are wider and not as clearly delimited as in 
<tp:taxon-name>

.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis

Etymology

</p>
            <p>We name this species after the village of Wahe (1.716°S, 124.843°E), which is the gateway to the highest elevations on Taliabu where it most commonly occurs. The species epithet is an indeclinable noun in apposition.</p>

Individual, age-related and sexual variation within taxon

</p>
            <p>
Two adult male specimens (holotype and 34.356) are virtually identical in coloration. Two additional male specimens (34.373 and 34.403), most likely immatures, are similar but have the scarlet body color replaced with a more rose-red hue (5R 4/14); they also do not exhibit any distinct olive margins of remiges. No comparative specimen material exists for adult females of the new species, which are generally similar among all regional 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species. Photos confirm that the female of the new species resembles other regional species (data not shown). One juvenile specimen (34.407) lacks red coloration and is generally drab grayish-brown (paler on underparts), becoming more intense earthen-brown on the mantle, rump and upperwing coverts, with the underside of remiges and rectrices mid-grey.

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
was first spotted by a University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 led by P.J. Davidson. Participants of this exploratory survey were probably the first ornithologists to visit the highlands of Taliabu between 600-800 m elevation (
64, 9 8
), where they found the new species predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m). FER then encountered the species commonly during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu between 4-18 April 2009 (

19
, 
48

), where we returned between 6-16 December 2013 to collect the holotype and accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has thus far only been found on the island of Taliabu within the Sula Archipelago. On Taliabu, we have recorded it from sea level to 1,300m (

19
, 
48

), and it presumably occurs further up all the way to the highest elevation at ~1,415m. The species inhabits forest canopy and edge habitat, and is a nectarivore and frugivore that has been photographed feeding at flowers (

48

). Akin to multiple other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species in Wallacea (

57

), the new species is seen far more often at higher elevations (roughly above ~800m) than in the lowlands. Davidson et al. (

64

), who first sighted this species, exclusively found it at higher elevations, mostly around ~800m, and we recorded it as “abundant” above 800m, whereas we have only had a handful of sightings in the lowlands. It is unknown to what extent elevational differences in abundance reflect the difficulty of detecting a canopy bird in tall lowland forest as compared to stunted montane forest. However, although detection difficulties may help mask its true abundance in the lowlands, we do not believe it is possible for the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
to be equally common across elevations given that other small canopy birds do not escape detection in the lowlands and are recorded commonly. In fact, the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
may even be a breeding endemic to montane elevations and only venture into the lowlands seasonally, following tree flowering and fruiting events. This potential seasonal displacement would explain why some expeditions have completely overlooked it in the lowlands while others have recorded it on occasion.
</p>
            <p>
It is contentious whether the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
is endemic to Taliabu, or also occurs on the other two main islands of the Sula Archipelago (Mangole and Sanana). The latter two have received even less ornithological attention than Taliabu, and to the best of our knowledge, the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has never been recorded there on recent ornithological expeditions (D. Yong, pers. comm.; J.A. Eaton, pers. comm.). Sanana is relatively low-lying (up to ~600m) and therefore likely to lack a number of Taliabu’s montane species. Mangole reaches its highest peak at 1,127m, but areas above 800m are confined to ~328 ha only, which gives it a comparatively small area of true montane forest. The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
’s level of dependence on vegetation at high elevations probably determines whether it would be capable of occurring on Mangole or even Sanana. Future fieldwork on those two islands will shed light on whether the new species occurs there or not.
</p>
            <p>
FER and Filip Verbelen first discovered a new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
population in the mountains of Peleng in the neighboring Banggai Archipelago during a visit between 23-30 March 2009 and recorded it as reasonably common at elevations between 700-900m in the western Peleng highlands (

49

). On our collecting expedition, we only had one aural encounter of this 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
on Peleng on 21 Dec 2013, indicating that the population might have been seasonally displaced or more retiring (

19

). However, photographic evidence from the 2009 visit indicates that the Peleng population has a plumage coloration that is very similar – if not identical – to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and quite different from 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
. As this Peleng population remains uncollected, future fieldwork will hopefully produce specimens allowing a determination whether there are differences between the Peleng birds and 
<tp:taxon-name>

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu is obviously a member of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, which used to be considered a single wide-ranging polytypic species for a long time (
6 1, 7 5
), but has now been divided into multiple monotypic island endemics by most recent authors on the basis of extensive plumage differences [e.g. (
57, 8 0, 99
)]. Within this radiation, its plumage most closely resembles that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, but is discrete from both of them in multiple characters (see Diagnosis). Its morphological differences from both 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
exceed those between other closely related species pairs within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. dammermani
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
(

73

). Therefore, its diagnosis here as a species level taxon rests on Mayr and Ashlock’s (

70

) yardstick approach, by which species status is conferred on the basis of divergences that exceed those of species pairs in which biologically important differences have been unequivocally demonstrated.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters have a wide vocal repertoire that is oftentimes problematic in the context of bioacoustic analysis (

73

). The Taliabu 
<tp:taxon-name>Myzomela</tp:taxon-name>
was hardly vocal during our encounters, and we do not consider vocalizations a fruitful taxonomic avenue in delimiting this new species from others. Instead, we have generated mitochondrial sequence data to further shed light on the new species’ taxonomic status.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial evidence
: Our mitochondrial tree analysis was based on sequences of the coding gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), comparing 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
to a great majority of members of the eastern and central Indonesian radiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters. Results indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
is most closely related to geographically adjacent species such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (

). Our analysis does not provide resolution on whether either 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
constitute the sister species to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
, and in fact, the latter two may well be sister to each other instead (

), rendering 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
a more basal species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from adjacent Buru is not represented in our mitochondrial dataset, and likely forms part of this group. Based on plumage coloration, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
is frequently considered to constitute the sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, and the two are sometimes merged under one species [e.g. (

99

)]. Therefore, we assume that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
– albeit closely related – will probably not emerge as the direct sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
in future analyses.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial ND2 divergence values between 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
and its two most closely related relatives (

<tp:taxon-name>M. elisabethae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chloroptera</tp:taxon-name>

) range between 3.5%–4.3% (

), well above the mitochondrial divergence threshold of 2-3% widely postulated in the literature (
10 0, 10 1
), providing additional support for species level recognition of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial analysis:
We extracted DNA from the breast muscle tissue of all our 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
material (n = 5), and from four independently collected 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
samples (

73

), using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. ND2 was then sequenced following Lim et al. (
10 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Using CodonCode Aligner version 8.0.2. (CodonCode, USA), our ND2 sequences were trimmed and assembled. These sequences of 991 bp length were then aligned in MEGA7 (
9 5
) with the ND2 sequences of 23 other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>The crown (from forehead to nape) is cold brown (2.5Y 2/2), delimited below by a narrow long white supercilium from bill base to napeside. Lores dark greyish brown (2.5Y 3/1) extending to just behind eye in the form of an eyestripe cutting through a broken white eye ring formed by small feathers peripheral to the eye. Black rictal bristles. Ear coverts and malar, facial and moustachial regions show white-and-dusky grizzling. Most of upperparts, including mantle, scapulars and rump, are mid-olive (5Y 4/4), while remiges are distinctly darker-olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). The white chin and throat are characterized by sporadic dusky speckles and lemon streaks increasing towards the lower throat, and grading into a fully lemon to sulphur yellow breast and belly (5Y 9/12). The yellow on the breast and belly has an olive-mottled appearance because of olive feather tips (5Y 4/4), especially pronounced towards the flanks, and white feather bases, especially pronounced towards the abdomen. The vent is solid lemon-yellow (5Y8/7). Iris dark-brown; bill black. Tarsus, toes and claws pinkish-grey with toepads paler yellowish.</p>

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The new species name is derived from “suara merdu” in Bahasa Indonesia, translating as “melodious voice”, referring to the pleasing vocalizations of this bird that FER heard hours before the first individual was seen, allowing for predictions prior to visual confirmation that this would be a new

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
During a visit to the highlands of Peleng between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently encountered this species at elevations between 700-900m (

49

). When hiking up to these elevations for the first time and hearing the melodious warble of this taxon in the distance, its superficial vocal resemblance to other members of the Wallacean 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation prompted FER to predict that this would be a new leaf-warbler taxon long before they laid their eyes on it. Once they first saw it, it was noticeable for its unusual behavior of frequently climbing along larger branches and trunks of trees in the manner of a treecreeper (
<tp:taxon-name>
Certhia
</tp:taxon-name>
). On our collecting expedition to Peleng between 18-23 Dec 2013, the species was less commonly encountered (

19

), probably because of seasonality.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new leaf-warbler is restricted to the highland forests of western Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago at elevations above 700m, reaching the highest island altitude above 1000m (

). Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago must be in serious doubt because only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, of which only 5 ha of land lie above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. Beyond the Banggai Archipelago,

Lemon ear coverts down to malar and moustachial regions (5Y 9/10) grizzled with dusky-olive feather edging, making for a mottled facial appearance. Upperparts from mantle and scapulars to rump are mid-olive (7.5Y 4/6). Remiges are distinctly darker- olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). Underparts from chin to vent are largely lemon to sulphur yellow, with white feather bases creating a more lemon-yellow hue on throat, breast and belly (7.5Y 8/8) and olive feather tips (5Y 4/4) generating a more olive- mottled appearance on flanks, while the undertail coverts are largely uniform lemon (5Y 9/12).</p>

<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
A University of East Anglia expedition by Davidson et al. (

64

) was the first to find a resident population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers on Taliabu, which they encountered commonly in montane forest and which they considered to represent an undescribed taxon. Rheindt (

48

) then studied this leaf warbler during his visit between 4-18 April 2009, and we found them again during our expedition between 6-16 Dec 2 013 and collected two (

19

).

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>
Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new warbler inhabits disturbed and undisturbed montane forest on Taliabu from 700m up to probably the highest elevations above 1,400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). It may also occur on the large neighboring island of Mangole, which rises to 1,127m and should harbor enough area of montane forest habitat above 700m to sustain a population. However, a lack of fieldwork in the mountains of Mangole means that there is no information available on its montane avifauna. The smallest main constituent of the Sula Archipelago, the densely populated island of Sanana, is unlikely to sustain any 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers as it barely reaches above 600m, which seems to be too low for this species. The species is replaced on the Banggai Archipelago by the newly described 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
(see SM5), while 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
replace it in various parts of Sulawesi. Given its more relaxed elevational requirements and its tolerance for disturbed habitat, this species is probably not as immediately endangered as some of the other montane Taliabu avifauna.

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
)


</p>
            <p>
The leaf-warbler genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
constitutes a large Old World radiation of small passerines that is exceptionally well-studied in phylogenetic terms (
10 6-1 09
). Recent demonstrations of genus paraphyly in combination with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
[summarized in (
10 8
)] have prompted a variety of new generic treatments, including a division into two re-defined genera [
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
; see (

57

)], but we here follow the latest phylogenetic treatise that suggests a merger of all 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
into a single genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
10 8
).
</p>
            <p>
Despite the genus’s well-known evolutionary history, a sizeable sub-clade of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Australasian (including Indonesian) Archipelago has largely been omitted from modern molecular insights. Notable exceptions include the first-ever example of a new avian species description (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. rotiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) partly based on genome-wide DNA data from the Timor region (
11 0
). However, most island populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
in this region have been merged into a limited number of ‘wastebasket species’, e.g. Mountain Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trivirgatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and Island Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
, although vocal and plumage differences among them often far exceed those documented among the better- studied continental groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
8 0
). As a consequence, some modern treatments [e.g. (

57

)] have adopted a ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) in which pairwise plumage and vocal differences between archipelagic taxa that are comparable in magnitude to those between better-studied continental species pairs (or exceed them) are interpreted as being indicative of species status. In this way, a number of highly distinct island taxa have been elevated to species level, such as Buru Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. everetti
, Seram Leaf Warbler
</tp:taxon-name>
               <tp:taxon-name>
P. ceramensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[a treatment that had previously been suggested on the basis of vocal and plumage comparisons; see (

80

)], and a number of additional Wallacean taxa. Our description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
follows this framework of affording species rank to taxa when vocal and plumage characters indicate deeper divisions. We also bring genome-wide DNA data to bear on the taxonomic classification of these two new species. However, following the yardstick approach as applied under the Biological Species Concept, we believe that biological characters, especially bioacoustic ones, will be the most important indicators when conferring species status in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers.
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: As for plumage characters, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
differ from each other and from surrounding taxa in a number of important traits (see Diagnosis for each taxon) which are far more salient than the plumage differences of often identical-looking species pairs on the Asian continent that are otherwise vocally and phylogenetically deeply diverged [e.g. the three members of the Arctic Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. borealis
</tp:taxon-name>
trio; (
11 1
)]. Most importantly, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
has a contrastingly white throat and supercilium and a grey-and-white grizzled auricular patch where all other surrounding taxa are much more yellowish, rendering it instantly recognizable in large series of specimens. In contrast, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is superficially reminiscent of Sulawesi Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
in its overall more yellowish coloration, displaying a phenotypic leapfrog pattern that has been documented from the Taliabu-Peleng-Sulawesi island trio on multiple previous occasions (
50, 7 2
). However, this superficial resemblance notwithstanding, it has important distinctions in bare-parts coloration and overall pigmentation (see Diagnosis), apart from obvious vocal differences.

Bioacoustic evidence
: In bioacoustic terms, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by melodious jumbles of 1–1.5sec, mostly at 2000–6000 Hz, with short individual high notes between 5000–7000 Hz occasionally interspersed. Song motifs generally lack repetitive element sequences or trills (

). In contrast, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by 1.5–3sec strophes mostly between 2000–6500 Hz (typically of a wider frequency range than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
) that constitute a melodious jumble often followed by a final repetitive phrase, which can sometimes be omitted (

). In this respect, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is slightly more reminiscent of the East Sulawesi population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng (despite the geographic proximity of the latter two). The 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
population on Gunung Tumpu (East Sulawesi) is often characterized by strong repetitive series at a very broad frequency range (2500–7000 Hz), mostly preceded by a variable but simple melodious series of elements between 2000–5000 Hz and a brief nasal note separating this variable series from the repetitive series (

). Depending on the presence or absence of components, the song rendition (=motif) can be 1.5–4sec long. In summary, the songs of these three forms (

<tp:taxon-name>P. suaramerdu</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. emilsalimi</tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
), while highly variable, are predictably different and strongly indicative of species status when put into the context of song differences among other 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
species (

).

Genomic evidence
: We generated a set of ~4,100 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment spanning almost 3 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial cytochrome- 
b
(cyt- 
b
) sequences, to shed light on the differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in separate Methods paragraphs below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three taxa (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
from East Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population-genomic space based on ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (

). The main division according to genomic PCA occurred between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
versus the other two taxa (PC1 in 

). The same relationship was strongly reflected in maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of concatenated genome-wide sequence alignments of almost 3 million base pairs length as well as in maximum-parsimony (MP) analysis of a concatenated set of ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (topology 1 in 

). In contrast, mitochondrial cyt- 
b
gene analysis and species-tree inference of genome-wide SNPs recovered a topology in which 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
were strongly supported sister lineages, with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
being more basal (topology 2 in 

). Depths of uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence (as determined by cyt- 
b
distances) were comparatively low across all three leaf-warblers (0.7-1.6%; 

).
</p>
            <p>
In summary, our phylogenomic analyses demonstrated considerable incongruence among tree topologies, including a strong mito-nuclear discordance that calls into doubt the reliability of mitochondrial divergence values in this dataset. For instance, the deepest genomic divergence was detected between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other two species (PC1 in 

), whereas on mitochondrial cyt- 
b
evidence 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
displayed some of the most shallow divergences from the other taxa (

). The use of mitochondrial divergences in species delimitation suffers from multiple confounding biases (
79, 10 0, 10 1
), especially when dealing with complexes containing closely-allied allopatric taxa that have a propensity for secondary gene flow (
11 2-11 4
). The best explanatory hypothesis for the pronounced mito- nuclear discordance in this dataset is that occasional overwater dispersal followed by hybridization and gene flow may have led to the introgression of foreign alleles in one or the other species, obfuscating clean branching patterns. Gene flow during sporadic hybridization is known to artifactually reduce mitochondrial divergences, masking deeper levels of genomic differentiation (

79

). Hence, introgression can account for the presence of relatively low mitochondrial divergences in a group of species characterized by comparatively deep genomic divergences and pronounced levels of bioacoustic differentiation [(

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted DNA from the fresh muscle tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and the three specimens collected by us (including the holotype) of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
, along with one individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
that we had collected on Mt Tumpu on the eastern peninsula of Sulawesi (

19

). Additional tissue samples were obtained from the American Museum of Natural History, New York (AMNH): three samples of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
from South Sulawesi and an outgroup sample of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus pallescens
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Solomon Islands. The AMNH samples were only used for phylogenomic rooting. DNA extraction was performed using the Exgene Clinic SV kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul) following the manufacturer’s instructions. We eluted the DNA in two consecutive rounds of 100μl molecular grade water. We prepared double-digest restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing (ddRADSeq) libraries using the same protocol as Garg et al. (
11 5
) with EcoRI and MspI as restriction enzymes. We quantified DNA and library product concentrations using the Qubit 2.0 Broad Range DNA Assay (Invitrogen, California), and used a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Iowa) to perform final quality checks on the library product. The genomic libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform at the Singapore Center for Environmental Life Science Engineering. Filtering and demultiplexing of the genomic data in STACKS 1.34 followed the same general procedures as detailed by Ng et al. (
7 2
), and are the result of comprehensive trials using a wide variety of different parameters and settings at each step of the analysis. DNA data is deposited with Genbank at BioProject accession number PRJNA566263.
</p>
            <p>
SNP calling and genomic supermatrix generation:
Reference genome alignment was performed using BWA 0.7.12 (
9 1
) and samtools 0.1.19 (http://samtools.sourceforge.net) (
9 2, 9 3
) on the Greenish Warbler (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
) genome (
11 6
), the most closely related available full genome. We performed SNP calling in STACKS 1.34 as per Ng et al. (
7 2
). We required loci to be present across all individuals, and retained one random SNP per locus to exclude obviously linked SNP loci. Subsequently, we used PLINK 1.9 (
11 7
) and Bayescan 2.1 (
11 8
) to filter SNPs for linkage disequilibrium and signs of selection. Data format manipulation and conversions were performed with PGDSpider (
1 19
). The final filtered dataset totaled 4,104 SNPs. In addition, we created concatenated SNP datasets for each group for use in downstream maximum parsimony analysis.
</p>
            <p>
Following the procedures used by Ng et al. (
7 2
), we generated a concatenated read supermatrix without missing data using pyRAD (
12 0
). We stipulated a minimum required locus coverage of 20, and kept the clustering threshold within and between reads at the default of 0.88. The final concatenated read supermatrix amounted to 2,861,661 bp in length, generated from 19,985 loci.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial sequence generation:
We sequenced cyt- 
b
using the primers H16065 (
12 1
) and L14995 (
12 2
), with 40 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 72°C. We conducted PCR product cleanup with ExoSAP-IT 
®
and used the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) for cycle- sequencing. Sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer using capillary electrophoresis. We assembled cyt- 
b
sequences with CodonCode Aligner 4.1 and aligned them with ClustalW (
12 3
). The final cyt- 
b
alignment was 1,100bp long, indel- free and fully translatable. Mitochondrial sequences have been deposited with Genbank at accession numbers 
MN518858
- 
MN518862
.
</p>
            <p>
Population structure inference:
In order to test for the presence of geographic structuring across East Sulawesi, Peleng, and Taliabu, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the genomic SNP data. PCA was performed using ade4 (
12 4
) and factoextra (
12 5
), both available as R packages (
12 6
).
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial tree inference:
We constructed phylogenetic cyt- 
b
trees using two methods: maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML). We ran MP analyses using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
), performing 10,000 bootstrap replicates. For ML analyses, we first used jModelTest v2.1.6 (

97

) and determined that the Jukes-Cantor model (
12 8
) was the best performing substitution model. We then ran RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) using the extensive subtree-pruning-regrafting tree search algorithm.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic tree inference:
We applied three different genomic tree inference analyses: coalescent-based species tree inference (applied to the SNP dataset), maximum likelihood tree inference (applied to concatenated read supermatrix), and maximum parsimony tree inference (applied to the concatenated SNP dataset). We performed species tree inference using SNAPP (
1 29
) as implemented in BEAST 2.3.0, performing two iterations using default settings. Tracer 1.6 was used after each iteration to ensure that the runs had reached convergence, after which LogCombiner v2.3.0 and DensiTree (
13 0
) were used to process results. We carried out ML tree inference using RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) on the concatenated read supermatrix using the general-time-reversible gamma-invariant (GTRGAMMA) model and performed 1,000 rapid bootstrap searches. Finally, we conducted conventional MP analysis on the concatenated SNPs of each taxon set, using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
) and running 10,000 bootstrap replicates to evaluate branch support.

Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts are bronzy olive (2.5Y 3/4), the remiges and rectrices slightly darker and with more coppery edging (10YR 4/6). Dull white on breast reaches to chin, with an orange-rufescent tinge (7.5YR 7/6) surrounding the breast laterally and ventrally. Yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, with a rufescent-orange suffusion to flanks (7.5YR 7/6). Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Dark-horn mandible. Yellow-orange tarsus on live bird.

One of the phenotypically most distinct subspecies of the Mountain Tailorbird or Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Uniquely among all subspecies, the new taxon has a rufescent suffusion on throat and breast, becoming especially pronounced on breast sides and auriculars (from where it grades into the rufous crown), rendering the bird’s anterior aspect much warmer-tinged than all other subspecies. The upperparts, especially upper wings, are also warmer bronzy and the flanks tinged more rufescent than all other subspecies, making this the most reddish-looking taxon in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. It additionally differs from most other subspecies (except those from Sulawesi and Peleng) in the rufous crown’s more posterior extension to the nape and in the absence of a pale supercilium.
</p>
            <p>
It further differs from

(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis

malayanus

riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow on belly and lower breast (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near- complete absence of yellow, respectively). For additional differences from the new subspecies on Peleng, see SM8.

Davidson et al. (

<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoiler (then called an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird) for Taliabu, and characterized the population as inhabiting montane forest above 500m and possibly in need of taxonomic description. FER found this population commonly in disturbed montane forest to over 1,100 m, with a few records in dense secondary bamboo thickets down to 50m (

48

), and our collecting expedition re-encountered this form abundantly at elevations around 1,300m (

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, this new subspecies is currently only known from Taliabu in the Sula Archipelago. There, it inhabits disturbed situations (forest edge, bamboo thickets) mostly in the mountains, with the highest record at 1300m, but presumably ranging to the highest point at over 1400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). On other islands, mountain leaftoilers rarely range lower than ~500m (

57

), but Rheindt (

48

) exceptionally recorded the new taxon on Taliabu from an extensive bamboo thicket at ~50m, demonstrating that this population may tolerate lower elevations. The presence of this leaftoiler on the other two main Sula islands, Mangole and Sanana, is likely, especially on the former, which rises to over 1,100m, but perhaps also on the latter, which reaches to a little over 600m. However, it has probably been overlooked owing to a lack of fieldwork at higher elevations on these two islands. On the Banggai Archipelago, the species is represented by another novel subspecies (see below) that replaces 
sulanus
there. Its predilection for disturbed forest situations and wide elevational tolerance as compared to other insular mountain birds probably means that it is currently not of conservation concern.

Crown and nape rich rufous (2.5YR 4/10), slightly darker posteriorly, and not extending as far onto the nape as in the new Taliabu subspecies (
P. c. sulanus
; see SM7). Short blackish eyestripe. Facial region from auriculars to lores dusky-grey (N3) with an increasing rufous suffusion (concolorous with crown) towards the malar and moustachial regions. Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts olive with a slight bronzy hue (5Y 3/4), colder-colored than in the new subspecies from Taliabu (
P. c. sulanus
). Remiges and rectrices are darker and duskier, but with outer edging nearly concolorous with mantle. Underparts are bicolored, with a white chin to breast, and a lemon-yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, and with a dusky olive suffusion on the flanks. Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Tarsus dark-yellow. On the live bird, the upper mandible was black with a yellow tip, and the lower mandible was black with a yellow base and tip. The iris color was not clearly discerned on the live bird.

            <p>
A distinct new subspecies of Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(or ‘Mountain Tailorbird’), differing from adjacent subspecies to the east and to the west in important discrete characters.
</p>
            <p>
The lack of a supercilium and the posterior extension of the rufous crown coloration onto the mid-nape set this subspecies apart from most other subspecies, except those from Sulawesi and Taliabu, which have an equally or sometimes even slightly more extensive rufous crown. It further differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis
(Borneo), 
malayanus
(Malay Peninsula) and all subspecies further west and north in the absence of a strong grey hindcollar band and/or strongly grey breast sides; from 
<tp:taxon-name>
batjanensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(Bacan Island) in its lemon-yellow belly lacking a strong olive suffusion; and from 
dumasi
(Seram and Buru) in its much less brown-colored upperparts. In many aspects, the new taxon is similar to the set of subspecies on Sulawesi (
riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow belly (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near-complete absence of yellow, respectively).
</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies shares many unique traits with the new subspecies from Taliabu 
sulanus
(see SM7), but differs significantly in its darker chestnut crown and its less reddish overall appearance, largely lacking a rufescent suffusion to the breast and flanks, and showing much less rufescent on the auriculars; its flanks are also much colder olive-washed (versus warmly rufescent-washed), and the upperparts and especially upper wings are colder bronze-olive. On live birds, the legs are much darker and less intensely colorful than those of birds from Taliabu.

FER and Filip Verbelen first encountered and documented the new subspecies during a visit to the highlands of western Peleng between 22-31 March 2009 (

Typical of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers, this new taxon is restricted to forest edge situations, treefall gaps and bamboo thickets in montane forest on the island of Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago. During our combined visits to the island (

19
, 
49

), we recorded this new taxon from 750m to the highest point at over 1000m elevation. It may, therefore, not range as low as the new taxon from neighboring Taliabu, although future fieldwork may well produce lower elevational records. Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago is unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new subspecies. Despite its very small range, its predilection for disturbed forest situations probably means that it is not particularly negatively affected by the current degradation that is impacting most highland forests of western Peleng.

Taxonomic rationale (combined for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus sulanus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
P. c. relictus
)


</p>
            <p>
The Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
was previously thought to be an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird and then called Mountain Tailorbird. We here acknowledge the distant relationship to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbirds (
13 1
) and therefore follow the recent trend of calling members of this species ‘leaftoilers’ rather than tailorbirds [e.g. (

57

)], a fitting translation from their re- instated scientific genus name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
. As for the species name 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, we follow the recently proposed emendation (

6

) of the original spelling of the name (‘ 
cuculatus’
) on the basis of information in the original description showing that the name was meant to refer to the birds’ hooded appearance (from Latin cucullus – hood).
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: The new subspecies 
sulanus
from Taliabu is arguably one of the most distinctly-colored, if not the single most distinctly-colored subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(see Diagnosis) and is therefore well-deserving of subspecies status. Its reddish-suffused anterior body renders it instantly recognizable among any series of specimens. Although not as unique in morphology, we also describe 
relictus
from Peleng at the subspecific level mainly on the basis of its distinct coloration. In plumage distinctness, 
relictus
far exceeds several other previously recognized subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, such as 
P. c. cinereicollis
.
</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic evidence
: We have been unsuccessful in procuring a sufficiently large sample set of song recordings of the two new subspecies, precluding rigorous bioacoustic analysis. However, we note that the songs given by these two subspecies in the field did not strike us as very different from the songs of other subspecies we are familiar with. Song playback with recordings from several other islands elicited a ready response at least in 
P. c. relictus
. Based on our bioacoustic experience with Indonesian passerines, we do not have the impression that song differences of the two new subspecies would warrant anything but a subspecific treatment at the present time.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic evidence
: We created a set of ~8,500 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment of over 2 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase intron 2 (ND2) sequences, to investigate levels of differentiation among 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in a separate Methods paragraph below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three subspecies (
P. c. stentor
from eastern Sulawesi, 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng and 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population- genomic space (

). The main genomic division according to a PCA based on ~8,500 SNPs occurred between 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu versus the other two subspecies (PC1 in 

). In contrast to the leaf-warbler analysis (see SM6), this main genomic division among leaftoilers was also supported by the mitochondrial tree and the genomic ‘species tree’ (

), consistently placing 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng close to 
P. c. stentor
from Sulawesi, although the concatenated tree built from genome-wide loci was in conflict, placing 
P. c. relictus
closer to 
P. c. sulanus
. Coincidentally, the majority tree with a basal placement of 
sulanus
(topology 1 in 

) is also the arrangement that would be supported by the extraordinarily divergent plumage of 
sulanus
, making it unique among all leaftoiler subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
Pairwise divergences between the subspecies (as determined by ND2 distances) were relatively low (0.3-1.7%; 

), at levels generally accepted to be below the species threshold for birds [(~2-3%; (
100, 10 1
)], consistent with the current proposed subspecies status. These ND2 divergences further supported the majority tree (topology 1 in 

) by consistently rendering 
P. c. sulanus
as the most deeply diverged subspecies (up to ~1.7%), whereas 
P. c. relictus
and 
P. c. stentor
emerged as only 0.3% diverged.
</p>
            <p>
In summary, mitochondrial sequence analysis, PCA of genome-wide SNPs and ‘species-tree’ analysis all agree in placing 
P. c. sulanus
basal to the other two subspecies, an arrangement supported by its distinct plumage. Therefore, we have no reason to suspect bias in the mitochondrial divergence depth (unlike in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
, see SM6), which supports our bioacoustic assessment that both 
relictus
and 
sulanus
are at the subspecies level. Future studies of the uniquely colored 
P. c. sulanus
may yet challenge this assessment.
</p>
            <p>
Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted genomic DNA of all tissue material available for 
P. c. sulanus
(n=5) and 
P. c. relictus
(n=2), along with two samples of 
P. c. stentor
that we had independently collected on Mt Tumpu on the adjacent eastern Sulawesi peninsula (

19

). Tissue of a single individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cettia parens
</tp:taxon-name>
from Makira in the Solomon Islands, provided by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was also extracted to serve as an outgroup in phylogenomic rooting. Laboratory and analytical protocols followed our procedures outlined in SM6 (under 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
), utilizing the same reference genome (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
), but using a minimum stack depth of 5 in STACKS 1.34 and a minimum required locus coverage of 5 in pyRAD due to differences in sequencing quality. The final filtered dataset for the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers totaled 8,515 SNPs and the final concatenated read supermatrix was 2,002,726 bp long, generated from 13,194 separate loci. For mitochondrial analysis, we sequenced ND2 using the primers L5219Met and H6313Trp (
13 2
) with 35 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 50-53°C, but otherwise following the procedures as outlined in SM6. The final ND2 alignment for the leaftoilers was 1,015bp long, indel-free and fully translatable. All DNA data has been deposited with Genbank at accession number PRJNA566263 and 
MN518850

Hartert, 1920 (‘extremely neglected’) from Selayar Island, were based on the impression that the description of these birds had escaped the attention of researchers for too long. The presently described taxon, only discovered in the 21

century, fulfils that criterion even more adequately, so we take pleasure in naming it 
omississimus
(‘the most neglected’), superlative of ‘omissus’.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The immature plumage remains undocumented. The only two male specimens known to exist (holotype and MZB.Ornit.34.488) show minimal plumage variation, the only difference perhaps being the latter specimen’s slightly brighter, more brilliant rump and darker, more blackish tarsus and claws in life.</p>
            <p>As compared to males, the three female specimens have a duller blue supercilium (but still discernible), lack a black chin, have prominent rufous spectacles over a narrow blackish stripe through the cere, the rufous continuing to the lower sides of the face where it is finely speckled dark (in two of three females the speckling continues to the throat sides), and have much less dark blackish-blue auriculars, contrasting less with the rufous throat. The female’s upperparts are less brilliant blue. One of the three female specimens is slightly paler on the tarsus and claws.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new subspecies was first reported by Indrawan et al. (
13 3
), who documented the sighting of a female on 15 May 2001 and a male on 29 July 2001 at 50-100m elevation around Benteng on the main island of Togian, and pointed out that this new population may be an undescribed subspecies. Following their footsteps, Filip Verbelen (pers. comm.) made the first sound recordings of the new population in December 2008 when studying a few individuals on Kadidiri, a tiny forested tourist resort island off the coast of Togian measuring ~4km in length and less than 1km in width. A few days later, F. Verbelen moved to Batudaka, one of the three main islands of the archipelago, where he found additional individuals in coastal forest near the capital town of Wakai. FER visited Batudaka Island from 23-27 April 2009 and observed this new population. On our collecting trip, we visited Batudaka from 24-28 Dec 2013 and found this taxon to be common in the forests outside the capital town of Wakai, collecting the present material in the process (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>The new subspecies is known from the Togian Archipelago in the Gulf of Tomini, a satellite group of islands between the northern and eastern peninsulas of Sulawesi. More specifically, to the best of our knowledge the new subspecies has so far been found on the two main islands of Togian and Batudaka, as well as on the tiny islet of Kadidiri off Togian, where it is common in remnant forest and edge from near sea level to at least ~200m elevation. However, it is likely that the birds occur up to the highest elevations at ~430m on these islands. More field research is required to map this subspecies’ occurrence on other islands in this archipelago. Its presence on some of the larger, forest-covered islands in close proximity to Batudaka and Togian, such as Talatakoh, Waleakodi and Waleabahi, is virtually guaranteed, given its occurrence on tiny Kadidiri. However, its presence on slightly more distant islands, such as Puah (at ~18km from the main archipelago) and Unauna (at ~28km from the main archipelago) is less certain, although these latter islands are connected to the main archipelago by shallow sea-beds not exceeding 120m depth, indicating that they would have been connected with one another during glacial sea level recessions.</p>
            <p>
On the main island of Sulawesi, the newly described 
omississimus
is replaced by the nominate taxon 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Unusually, however, the nominate form on Sulawesi is a hill and montane forest denizen, occurring from 500-2300m elevation and shunning lowland forest habitats in stark contrast to the new subspecies.
</p>
            <p>The new subspecies appears to be moderately tolerant to habitat disturbance where small-scale timber extraction leads to a secondarization of primary forest. However, the taxon disappears where forest is converted into agricultural land. Although Togian’s forests are quickly dwindling, with most remnants by now secondary and restricted to inland locations away from the coast, far more than half of the islands should still be suitable for the new taxon, making it safe for the time being.</p>

            <p>
Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The proposed English name of this new taxon follows a recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] to call members of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
‘jungle-flycatchers’ rather than ‘blue-flycatchers’ because molecular data (
13 4
) and bioacoustic considerations (
57, 7 4
) strongly suggest a merger of many members of the previously recognized jungle-flycatcher genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinomyias
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Given that numerous species in the resultant genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
are no longer blue but entirely brown, the name ‘blue-flycatcher’, while formerly appropriate, is no longer suitable for this genus.
</p>
            <p>
Although distinguishable from other subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
in terms of plumage characters (see Diagnosis), 
omississimus
is quite similar to them in general coloration. At any rate, plumage coloration is not an ideal taxonomic indicator in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
jungle-flycatchers, many of which boast a highly conserved male plumage sporting blue upperparts and reddish underparts. Other characters, such as bioacoustic and genetic ones, may be more conducive to guiding taxonomic decision-making in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
We recently published a bioacoustic comparison on the basis of six vocal parameters among members of the greater 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, showing that the song of the newly described 
omississimus
from Togian exhibits considerable vocal overlap with the songs of all three analyzed subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
, while distinctly differing from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. kalaoensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[see 

in (
7 4
)]. This vocal evidence along with Togian’s proximity to Sulawesi suggest a placement of 
omississimus
as a subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Based on a lack of deep differentiation in both bioacoustic and genetic evidence, we propose to classify this new taxon at the subspecies level. Upon first discovery in the field, we were generally impressed by its lowland forest occurrence, which stands in contrast to the montane forest requirements of the nominate subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi. This pronounced difference in habitat preference was given much weight in supporting species- level recognition of the new Togian population in a recently published field guide to the region (

57

). However, given Gwee et al.’s (
7 4
) newly published data, the latter treatment has ultimately proved erroneous.

in its lack of solid white or rufous on the belly; its uniform dark-brown coloration in which only the underparts show a faint warm tinge; and its unmarked dark-brown vent. The new subspecies has a darker hood and breast than the above-mentioned taxa except for the intensely rufous-bellied 
fumidus
and perhaps 
hygroscopus
. It also differs from 
deningeri
from Seram in its paler, browner (less black) body color, with a darker non-contrasting hood, and differs from 
schlegelii
and 
sterlingi
(both from Timor) in its less olive overall coloration and lack of rufous belly and vent.
</p>
            <p>
Within Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely resembles the much larger and longer-winged 
versteegi
and 
papuensis
from Papua but is dark slaty-brown (versus black) in overall body color and has an unmarked vent. The lower underparts have more extensive and paler-cinnamon feather margins in the new subspecies versus narrower, more rufous feather margins in the Papuan forms.
</p>
            <p>
Among geographically more distant Island Thrush subspecies from outside of Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely approaches three taxa from the Solomon Islands (
bougainvillei, kulambangrae, sladeni)
and two taxa from the Bismarck Archipelago (
heinrothi, beehleri
), but lacks those subspecies’ blackish overall body color. It also superficially resembles 
nigrorum
from Negros (Philippines), but the latter subspecies’ lower belly grades into whitish on the vent while the new subspecies is uniformly dark on those parts. Furthermore, another Philippine subspecies, 
kelleri
from Mt Apo (Mindanao), is similar to the new subspecies but becomes darker brown towards the front of the head while the new subspecies has a nearly uniform head coloration becoming slightly paler on the forehead.

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The subspecies name, translated from Bahasa Indonesia “it likes the rain” (=suka hujan), refers to the circumstances surrounding the bird’s discovery. On FER’s first expedition to the highest parts of Taliabu (

48

), heavy persistent rain impeded bird observations, leading to a decision to abort the expedition ahead of schedule. On his premature descent, FER then spotted a hardy individual of the new thrush, perched in the pouring rain, leading him to change plans yet again and mount a subsequent second and eventually third expedition to these elevations in better weather. This latter third expedition then allowed for a more detailed documentation of Taliabu’s distinct novel montane avifauna (

19
, 
48

). The name 
sukahujan
is treated as an inalienable noun in apposition.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>All nine specimens procured resemble one another considerably in coloration. The greatest variation occurs in the tone of the lower breast and abdomen, which is intermediate in the holotype but ranges from all-drab brownish grey throughout with almost no warm edging (in MZB.Ornit.34.416) to more extensive cinnamon feather edging (in most adult females, especially MZB.Ornit.34.409), the latter leading to an overall warmer underparts impression. Females are variably slightly less slaty on upperparts and crown, and one adult individual (MZB.Ornit.34.416) of unknown sex has a male-like slaty tone on upperparts but a female- like crown color that is more suffused with dull brown. Two juveniles (MZB.Ornit.34.410; MZB.Ornit.34.417) exhibit noticeable mottling on their mantle and underparts coloration, caused by dark brownish-black feather margins contrasting against the paler (on underparts sometimes warm cinnamon) feather centers.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new taxon was first discovered on 8 and 9 April 2009 by FER near its type locality on the occasion of a hike to the highest elevations on Taliabu that was cut short by heavy rainfall. Subsequent sightings on 14 and 15 April 2009 were made in the same area on the occasion of a return visit (

48

). We found this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected the type along with the accompanying specimens.

<tp:taxon-name>
T. poliocephalus

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
With approximately 50 subspecies, the Island Thrush 
<tp:taxon-name>
Turdus poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
is arguably the most polytypic bird species on Earth (
13 5
). Attempts to separate this variable species complex into smaller species-level lineages [e.g. (
13 6
)] have been called into question by genetic data showing that plumage characters are not a good predictor of close relationships in this complex (
13 7
). Hence, modern sources generally continue to unite all or most subspecies into one polytypic species. Not unlike some Philippine subspecies previously under study (
13 7
), the new subspecies from Taliabu is phenotypically extremely different from neighboring forms but more closely resembles certain geographically distant subspecies. It is presently best accommodated at the subspecies level. Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic inquiries are needed in the future to assess whether any internal species limits must be drawn within the complex. Such future analyses may well elevate the Taliabu Island Thrush to species level. However, such analyses are currently hampered by a lack of crucial comparative DNA material.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Forehead to crown and nape dark slaty blue (2.5PB 2/2) with slightly scaly appearance generated through narrow black feather centres; the same color, but without the scaly appearance, then continues through mantle and scapulars to rump. A white supercilium starts above the centre of the eye and ends just shy of the bill base, becoming narrower towards the front. A black facial patch centred in the loral region and below the supercilium to the chin (with narrow rows of black feathers above the bill base) grades into dark slaty blue coloration (2.5PB 1.5/2) towards the auriculars and the malar and moustachial regions, merging with the nape and mantle. Upperwing coverts largely concolorous with crown, with vestiges of an extremely indistinct brighter carpal patch visible with difficulty on this specimen. Remiges are dark slaty brown (10YR 2.5/1), the larger primaries with warmer, paler outer edging (10YR 4/2). Breast intensely rufous (7.5YR 7/12), becoming slightly paler on throat and upper flanks, and becoming pale cinnamon-whitish on belly and lower flanks (7.5YR 9/4), and eventually off-white on undertail coverts. Tail dull black on upper side, blackish-grey (N2) on underside, with indistinct white base to outermost rectrices. Iris dark-brown; legs light-pink; black bill with pinkish gape flange on live bird.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
An unequivocal member of the Snowy-browed Flycatcher 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ficedula hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
, and one of its most easterly outposts, with minor plumage distinctions in the male and major plumage distinctions in the female, a combination of which conclusively demarcates this new taxon from other subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
The male subtly differs from adjacent insular subspecies to the south and to the west, namely from the two Sulawesi subspecies (
jugosae, annalisa
), from 
sumatrana
(Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo), from 
vulcani
(Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores), and from 
alifura
(Buru), in the reduction of white patches at the base of the outer tail feathers, and in the slightly less extensive rufous underparts, replaced on the belly by pale cinnamon- whitish. In contrast, males of the only subspecies to the east and north (
pallidipectus
from Bacan Island) are markedly paler on the underparts than the males of this new subspecies, and have more contrastingly olive flanks. The white supercilium in males of the new subspecies is narrower than that of at least 
sumatrana, vulcani
, and 
alifura
.
</p>
            <p>
The female is highly distinct from most subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
in her bluish (versus olive, brown or grey-brown) upperparts coloration, extensive cold-brown mottling on breast (versus little to none), and a washed-out face pattern ghosting that of the male, with a whiter (versus rufous) brow. The only other subspecies that equals female 
F. h. betinabiru
in her bluish tinge to the upperparts is 
alifura
from adjacent Buru, in which the back color is ever so slightly brighter-blue. Compared to the new subspecies, the female of 
alifura
exhibits a more rufous (less white) eye brow, and brighter and more extensive rufous underparts with less brown mottling.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>
Only adult specimens have been procured, although a photo of a 
pullus
near the nest suggests an early juvenile plumage similar to other subspecies. Among adults, tarsus color as recorded in the field on live birds appears to vary individually from light-pink to pinkish-horn.
</p>
            <p>There is minor variation among the nine adult male specimens procured in the lower extent of the rufous breast, the intensity of the cinnamon wash to the belly, thickness of the supercilium and the extent of vestigial white patches on the basal outer rectrices. There is minor variation among the five adult female specimens in the intensity of brown mottling on the underparts, width and paleness of the supercilium and the presence or absence of a slight brownish tinge to the lowermost mantle portion.</p>

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies of Snowy-browed Flycatcher was first encountered by the University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 (
64, 9 8
). Members of that survey found the new taxon predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m) and suggested that it may be a novel subspecies. FER then saw one adult male at 1100m during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu on 5 April 2009 (

48

). We returned to this general area between 6-16 December 2013, where we found 
betinabiru
as one of the most common constituents of the forest interior understorey avifauna and collected the type and accompanying individuals at ~1300m (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
Subspecies 
betinabiru
is currently only known from the understorey of dense montane forest in the highlands of Taliabu at above 800m elevation (
19, 48, 64, 9 8
). Extensive logging has occurred across the highlands of Taliabu, with some parts of the mountains additionally affected by large-scale forest fires (see Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler account in SM3; 

). As an understory inhabitant, 
betinabiru
would be particularly susceptible to this kind of habitat degradation and is therefore probably declining. Nevertheless, it remains extremely common where good habitat persists, as indicated by our high mistnet capture rates (

19

).
</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, Snowy-browed Flycatchers have not been detected on the two other main islands of the Sula Archipelago, although their occurrence is possible at least on Mangole, which rises to 1,127m, while very unlikely on Sanana, which does not rise taller than ~600m. If confirmed on Mangole, it is likely that the local population would refer to the same subspecies 
betinabiru
.
</p>
            <p>
On the adjacent Banggai Archipelago, a single Snowy-browed Flycatcher was recorded once in April 2009 at 800-900m on the tallest island of Peleng (

49

). To the best of our knowledge, there have not been subsequent records from this island despite extensive fieldwork. In the absence of photos or closer details about the single Peleng record, it is impossible to ascertain whether the Peleng population is ascribable to 
betinabiru
, to one of the two Sulawesi races (
annalisa, jugosae
) or to a novel unnamed subspecies.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We describe this new taxon on the basis of its characteristic plumage (especially in females). These plumage distinctions certainly warrant a description at the subspecific level as they exceed those of several more poorly marked subspecies within this complex (e.g. 
annalisa
[Stresemann, 1931], which only subtly differs from 
jugosae
[Riley, 1921]). Bioacoustic variation in this species complex is poorly explored, but the high-pitched courtship vocalization of the new subspecies superficially resembles that of many other subspecies, and playback of songs from other subspecies elicits a ready response from members of this population. Genetic differences between the new taxon and other subspecies remain unexplored.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Crown, nape, ear coverts and neck sides are mid-brown (7.5YR 4/2), with a distinct cinnamon-chestnut forehead extending over eye (7.5YR 4/8). Black rictal bristles. Nape color slowly grading into warmer cinnamon-rufous (2.5YR 4/10) across mantle, scapulars and rump to the basal 60% portion of tail. The outer remiges are mostly dark dusky-brown (7.5YR 2/1), becoming paler and more olive-brown (7.5YR 4/2) towards the inner remiges. All remiges have narrow but intense rufous outer edging concolorous with rump and lower back color. The wing coverts are almost identical to the inner remiges in color, with an increasing intensity and width of bright-rufous feather tipping towards the median and lesser coverts. The distal 40% of the tail is greyish-black (N2), with paler rufous tips (5YR 5/6) on the underside only. Chin and throat form a white triangle delimited below by a conspicuous large black breast patch. A diffuse band of grey coloration (N5) with a black scaly appearance created by black feathers with narrow grey edging demarcates the black breast patch on its lower side. The belly is pale buff (7.5YR 9/8), grading into a richer, fuller hue on the flanks and undertail coverts (7.5YR 5/6). The iris is dark-brown, the bill black with a pinkish base to the lower mandible, and the tarsus on the live bird was described as pinkish- horn.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A mid-sized, rufous-toned 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura
</tp:taxon-name>
typical of a radiation of fantails distributed throughout Australasia. It most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
(

57

), and constitutes the third member of this radiation. Its plumage distinctions from the other two species are subtle yet consistent. However, the most characteristic distinction is its unique courtship vocalization (
7 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, the new species differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Sula Islands in its much narrower, less distinct rufous tips to the underside of the rectrices, in its more distinct black scaling below the black breast patch, and in its more strongly cinnamon-buff (less white) central underparts. The new species’ throat is cleaner white, less interspersed with dusky tips to the feathers.
</p>
            <p>
The new species differs from all three subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi in its wider black portion of the tail and its warmer brown crown and upper mantle. When compared to the geographically most closely adjacent subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni toradja
</tp:taxon-name>
from eastern and central Sulawesi, the new species additionally differs in its cleaner white throat and slightly less conspicuous scaling below the black breast patch, while it is additionally distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
of the Lompobattang Massif in South Sulawesi by its blacker breast patch and by the richer chestnut (less cinnamon) coloration of its brighter body parts (such as supercilium, rear upperparts, flanks and vent).

Etymology

</p>
            <p>The new species’ epithet is in honor of the late Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie (deceased 11 Sep 2019), the third president of the Republic of Indonesia. President Habibie was known as a keen environmentalist and contributed greatly to the science and conservation of nature in Indonesia.</p>

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The only three specimens (all adult; one female, two males) exhibit limited variation in terms of extent of breast patch and black mottling below breast patch that may have been caused by the preparation of the specimens.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new species has doubtless been known to the local inhabitants of Peleng Island for a long time. Mochamad Indrawan was presumably the first outside ornithologist to see this new bird when encountering a dead individual during his work on Peleng in the mid-2000s and re- encountering the species in the wild on several undated occasions (

49

). During a field trip between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently observed the species near the type locality (

49

), where we returned from 18-23 Dec 2013 to collect the type and the accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new species is restricted to montane forest on the island of Peleng, the largest landmass in the Banggai Archipelago, at elevations not lower than 750m (

19
, 
49

) (

). Over two longer visits to the highlands of Peleng, we found that the species becomes gradually more common towards higher elevations before it seems to drop out somewhere slightly below the tallest peak on Peleng at 1,022m. The new species is replaced on Sulawesi to the west by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
, and on the Sula Archipelago to the east by 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Its occurrence on other islands of the Banggai Archipelago is highly unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
must be considered threatened given the small extent of its occurrence and the continuing loss of its habitat. Only 25,071 ha of land on Peleng fall above the approximate 750m elevational cutoff, most of it formerly constituting a single contiguous block of highland forest (

). However, our own observations in combination with satellite imagery indicate extensive forest loss to small-scale agriculture and logging by burgeoning village communities. Google Earth’s present coverage of the area is mixed, with large swathes covered by insufficient or outdated (e.g., 2004) imagery. However, given current satellite coverage, a conservative estimate is that 9,987 ha (~40%) from within the elevational range of

have either been completely deforested or constitute young regrowth or unviable forest fragments surrounded by clearings. This would leave only 15,084 ha of more or less undisturbed primary or older secondary forest. Recent observations indicate, however, that this extent of forest loss is probably an underestimate. After the first discovery of this species and a number of other new bird taxa on Peleng (

49

), the island became a destination for an average of 1-3 international adventure and birdwatching tour groups per year, which considerably helped spur the local economy of the village near the type locality (name withheld). While this sort of ecotourism has a positive impact on the natural environment in many reported cases, on Peleng the sudden influx of tourist dollars led to observations of increased logging and expansion of infrastructure, prompting the rapid destruction of forest at the original type locality over the last five years. In the near future, it will be of paramount importance for the survival of Peleng’s unique montane fauna to find ways in which the influx of eco-tourism dollars can create incentives for conservation.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
Based on its plumage coloration, the new species is clearly a member of the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, hitherto known from Sulawesi and the Sula Archipelago (

57

). The discovery of a new constituent of this radiation on the Banggai Archipelago closes the geographic gap between Sulawesi and Sula. Most previous taxonomic treatises (e.g. 
6 1, 7 5
) have regarded all members of this radiation as conspecific, and indeed plumage differences are relatively minor and have long been interpreted as consistent with a subspecific treatment. However, recent research into patterns of bioacoustic and genomic differentiation among rusty-bellied fantails from Sulawesi, Sula and Banggai has produced strong evidence in favor of species level treatment of all three island populations (
7 2
).

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="biology_ecology">
            <p>
Vocalizations
: Bioacoustically, the courtship vocalization (=song) of the new species from Peleng is the most distinct of any member of the radiation. A detailed characterization of this song has been published elsewhere (

49

). In fact, when we first found the species in the field, the bird stood out through its unusual, simple descending song that lacks the typical complex tinkling quality of its congeners (

49

). Quantitative bioacoustic comparisons revealed that the unusual vocal features of the new Peleng species have led to an acoustic leapfrog pattern in rusty-bellied fantails in which the two terminal (=easternmost and westernmost) species (i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) are more similar to each other in courtship vocalizations but are geographically divided by the new species with its unusual song (
7 2
). The great vocal distinctness of the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
is surprising because it belies its geographic proximity to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
(Sulawesi)
</tp:taxon-name>
across a combined lowland and sea gap of less than 40km and its frequent land connection to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
(Taliabu)
</tp:taxon-name>
across Pleistocene land bridges during times of global cooling (

49

). Vocal behavior is known to be an important feature in species cohesion and reproductive isolation in songbirds (
7 6, 77
), and has been shown to be more important as an indicator of species limits than plumage traits in some passerine lineages (

78

). Therefore, recent authors have accepted the unmistakable vocal uniqueness of the new Peleng fantail as an indication of its status as an undescribed new species (
57, 7 2
).

Genomic data
: In a previously published analysis (
7 2
), we conducted a comparison of&gt;11,000 genome-wide markers with a complete representation among 16 individuals spanning all three species within the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. In this analysis, the new species from Peleng emerged as most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (both subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
toradja
) and less closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sula. This phylogenomic result is significant considering that – among all pairwise vocal comparisons – the greatest bioacoustic differentiation is found between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and the new species, with strong vocal distinctions in both non-courtship vocalizations and courtship songs (
7 2
). Therefore, the relatively shallowest genomic differentiation among the three island populations corresponds to the deepest bioacoustic divergence.
</p>
            <p>
Although the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
emerged as most closely related within the radiation, comparisons of genome-wide data allow for the designation of both taxa as independent species: the basal split between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other taxa is mainly based on a genomic signal contained in ~20% of the genetic variance across study loci, whereas the second most dominant genomic signature – contained in ~14% of the genetic variance across markers – predominantly represents the deep divergence between the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
[

in (
7 2
)]. The presence of a significant proportion of genomic locus cohorts displaying deep differentiation between the new species and either of its two neighbors was in agreement with gene flow analyses (‘ABBA-BABA tests’) that pointed to a history of rare introgression between the new species and its neighbors (
7 2
), perhaps during episodes of unusual climate forcing dispersal between islands. Such secondary introgression is not unusual among congeneric bird species (

79

) and is not in conflict with species level treatment.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>
The entire crown from forehead to nape is rich earthen-brown (7.5YR 3/3) with slightly darker feather margins creating a scalloped appearance. A thin off-white supercilium is pronounced from bill base to just behind eye, from where it slowly tapers out. Lores are dark brownish-black (2.5Y 1.5/1). Ear coverts are of a medium earthen-brown tone (5YR 3/1) with fine pale shaft streaks giving a grizzled appearance, grading into a more greyish-brown tone (10YR 6/1) in the moustachial and malar region. The mantle and scapulars down to the uppertail coverts are largely concolorous with the crown but lack the scalloping created by darker feather margins. The remiges are mostly a rich cold dark-brown (2.5YR 2/1) but have warmer outer webs concolorous with mantle. The upperwing coverts are similarly two-toned, being mostly concolorous with mantle but some showing darker outer webs concolorous with most of remiges. As typical for the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
, the rectrices are narrow and dark- brown, very close in color to the remiges (2.5YR 2/1). The tail feathers are mostly worn, although one in the centre appears to be a new replacement.
</p>
            <p>The white chin and throat are quite sharply demarcated from the face. The lower throat and upper breast, still white, are interspersed with fine dusky speckling increasing towards the breast and lower throat sides where the color grades into a solid mid-grey (N5) with only few inconspicuous dusky speckles. The grey breast color then grades into a tawny- ochraceous belly color (7.5YR 4/6), first through tracts of grey feathers which have warm- ochraceous edging, then through tracts of largely ochraceous feathers that still have a grey feather centre, eventually to all-ochraceous feathers. The belly color becomes darker and richer on the undertail coverts and flanks (7.5YR 3/4).</p>
            <p>The bill is black with an inconspicuous paler tip. The gape on the live bird was slightly enlarged light yellow. The iris is dark brown. The tarsus and toes were described on the live bird as maroon-horn with paler, more yellowish toepads.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A rich dark-brown forest warbler typical of the montane resident 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. As is usual across this cryptic genus, the new taxon is most conspicuous not on the basis of its plumage but its vocalizations.
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, it is most similar in size and shape to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
of Sulawesi. However, in comparison to the new taxon, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
has less distinct speckling on the breast, has a more uniform crown that is less scalloped, paler and warmer brown upperparts, greyer underparts with brown mostly only on flanks, and has a less pointed, wider tail.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram differs in its less distinct central breast spotting, greyer (less whitish) supercilium, and more extensive grey on breast reaching further onto upper breast, neck sides and auriculars.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru differs in its much whiter breast, with off-white reaching onto mid-belly, whereas only the lower flanks and lower belly are warm-brown. Although the central breast of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
has a mid-grey tinge, its underparts are much paler than the new species’ fairly uniform grey lower breast, which grades into a fairly dark homogeneous warm-brown belly.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is quite different from the smaller 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. montis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Java. The latter is much paler cinnamon-brown on upperparts, crown and especially remiges and rectrices, and is uniformly buff-white below with extensive dark-brown speckling from chin to upper belly, lacking the new species’ grey tones on the breast and dark warm-brown tones on the belly.

The name 
<tp:taxon-name>
portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
– past participle of Latin ‘portendere’ – roughly translates as “the predicted one” or “the foretold one” and relates to the unusual circumstances of discovery when FER first heard the new warbler and recognized it to be a novel species of

multiple days before a visual confirmation was obtained.

            <p>Currently only one adult specimen is available (i.e., the holotype), and photos of up to two more adults suggest that this is probably a sexually monomorphic species with limited plumage variation.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
FER was the first person to discover 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on 9 April 2009 near its type locality when he heard an unmistakable insect-like sound that he attributed to a hitherto unnamed taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
grasshopper-warbler. Having been exposed to the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on a visit to Sulawesi only two weeks prior, and having had previous field experience with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru and Seram, respectively (
8 0
), FER was aware that the song of this population – albeit superficially reminiscent of the others – is distinct at the species level. Even so, because of the retiring nature of this bird and ill-timed heavy rain, it took FER another two hiking expeditions to the highlands of Taliabu to finally confirm on 15 April 2009 that this song was indeed uttered by what he perceived as an “unusually dark” individual of grasshopper-warbler (

48

). We encountered this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected a single specimen, now the holotype.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is presumably restricted to montane forest at the highest elevations of the island of Taliabu (

19
, 
48

) (

). All our records are from elevations above 1,050m on the more mountainous western half of the island of Taliabu, which reaches its highest altitude of ~1,415m at an unnamed peak near our collection locality (

). The new species inhabits a peculiar type of dwarf montane forest typical of these elevations.
</p>
            <p>
The occurrence of the new species on neighboring islands is highly doubtful. Of the three major islands that form the Sula archipelago, Taliabu is the largest and tallest. The smallest main island, Sanana, barely reaches above 600m elevation. The highest elevation on its larger neighbor Mangole is 1,127m – theoretically within the elevational range of this grasshopper-warbler – but the area of land above 1,050m on Mangole is only ~36 ha, which is too small an area to allow for the survival of a highly montane bird species throughout evolutionary time scales. On the neighboring Banggai archipelago, the situation is similar: the only island high enough to allow for the theoretical possibility of grasshopper-warbler breeding occurrence is Peleng (highest elevation ~1,022m), but extensive fieldwork around this highest area has not revealed the presence of any resident grasshopper-warblers (

19
, 
49

).
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
must be a rare bird: Taliabu’s area above 1,050m amounts to ~16,690 ha of formerly forested land in the interior of the island’s western half, over 97% of which forms one contiguous block (

). However, satellite imagery predominantly from 2004 indicates that a total of ~1,023 ha (~6.1%) of this area had been affected by logging operations that have degraded the forest and removed its undercover, presumably rendering the affected areas unsuitable, or nearly so, for the grasshopper-warbler. In the one-and-a-half decades since the satellite images were obtained, extensive additional logging is likely to have occurred. Another 940 ha (~5.6%) of the area above 1,050m have succumbed to a series of catastrophic forest fires in 1982 and 1983, and now constitute open grassland habitat unsuitable for this warbler (

). Our surveys showed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
does not occur in the extensive recently generated grasslands in the highlands of Taliabu (

48

). This leaves 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
with less than 15,000 ha of suitable habitat, an area likely to further diminish in size with ongoing habitat destruction and the impacts of global warming leading to an upward elevational shift of habitat zones.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We include this new taxon within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
following the phylogenetic demonstration that the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bradypterus
</tp:taxon-name>
(previously used for this Southeast Asian clade of warblers) is restricted to Africa (
8 1, 8 2
). Its inclusion within 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
is the reason why we follow the recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] of using the English moniker ‘grasshopper-warbler’ rather than the term ‘bush-warbler’, which is more appropriately reserved for members of a radiation in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Cettiidae</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
is renowned for its cryptic and conservative coloration that has confounded plumage-based classifications for decades and led to delays in the recognition of species-level taxa until bioacoustic and molecular methods have been applied (
8 3, 8 4
). In Wallacea, members of a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from Sulawesi and the Moluccas were previously united into a single polytypic species 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
(
6 1, 7 5
), but have recently been divided into three constituent island species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru, on the basis of their strikingly different songs (

57

). Our new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is geographically surrounded by constituents of this radiation and is a member of it both on the basis of morphological characters (see Diagnosis) and bioacoustic ones.
</p>
            <p>
Although plumage distinctions are not as important in the genus, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by comparatively unique, dark-brown upperparts that stand in contrast to the generally paler and warmer-brown upperparts of neighboring species. However, we mainly attribute species status to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on the basis of its unique song and genetic differentiation. We here provide an excerpt of ongoing analyses as relating to the bioacoustic and mitogenomic differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from neighboring species.

Bioacoustic evidence
: A total of 41 suitable, high-quality, homologous 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
song recordings from the field were gathered for analysis from various sources, encompassing all three previous species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation plus the new species. These recordings were measured for 11 suitable bioacoustic parameters, and resultant measurements were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and a conservative vocal diagnosability criterion (

85

), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Further details regarding all analyzed recordings, such as GPS locations, dates, times, and names of recordists, are listed in table S3, while more details on bioacoustic methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
Based on the Isler Criterion, eight out of eleven song parameters measured were diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and two other taxa: 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (table S4). Four out of eleven parameters were Isler-diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (table S4). The ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) can be adopted to ascertain if the level of vocal divergence between these archipelagic taxa is comparable in magnitude to divergences across unequivocal species-level divisions. When comparing Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler song against that of the Friendly Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
, a geographically distant species from montane Borneo that has never been included in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, only two parameters emerged as Isler-diagnosable (table S4). Using this result as a yardstick for what constitutes species level vocal differentiation, the magnitude of vocal divergence between Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
on Seram, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
on Buru, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on Sulawesi is extremely high, indicating they all have diagnosably distinct vocalizations that are best reflected in species rank.
</p>
            <p>
Principal component analysis of the vocal measurements underscores the vocal distinctness of Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from the other three Wallacean species (

). A cumulative proportion of variance of 73.3% is accounted for in the first two principal components, suggesting a strong vocal differentiation between Taliabu and the remaining taxa (

).
</p>
            <p>
Mitogenomic evidence
: Using whole-genome sequencing and laboratory approaches for the use of ancient DNA, we created an alignment of whole-mitochondrial sequences spanning ~15,000 base pairs (bp) across 11 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals belonging to all four constituent island forms of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, and used three different phylogenetic tree-building methodologies to investigate relationships and levels of divergence. More details on the methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
All three phylogenetic trees produced indicated identical topologies with high bootstrap support (

), suggesting that the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is an independent lineage most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (mitogenomic divergence ~2%), and much more distantly related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (divergence ~4.8–5%) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (divergence ~7.7–8%). Mitogenomic divergences roughly correlate with those from the COI barcoding gene, although they do not have to be equal in magnitude.
</p>
            <p>
Integrating the vocal and mitogenomic evidence, it is clear that bioacoustic differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, the two species which emerged most closely related on the mitogenomic tree (

), far exceed those between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and a geographically distant species (
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
) that has never been closely associated with the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. Our combined evidence therefore supports the treatment of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
as a well-diverged small-insular endemic species.

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic sampling:
We obtained 41 homologous recordings, which were either recorded by us in the field, or privately sourced from avid field ornithologists (including Robert O. Hutchinson and Ross Gallardy), or collected from publicly accessible online databases, namely the Avian Vocalization Center (AVoCet at http://avocet. integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu), the Xeno-Canto Sound Library (www.xeno-canto.org), the Macaulay Sound Library (www.macaulaylibrary.org), and the Internet Bird Collection (www.hbw.com/ibc).
</p>
            <p>Although slight variation in recording quality exists in the equipment used, inspection and comparison of spectrograms from different devices showed that this variation is comparable to that amongst recordings made by one sole recordist using the same device. In addition, although there is some variability in background noise, spectrogram inspection suggested that measurements of vocalizations would not be affected. Measurements of the recordings were performed using the program Raven Pro Version 1.5 (Bioacoustics Research Program, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA) on its default settings. The following eleven parameters were chosen for bioacoustic analysis, with each parameter averaged over all the measurements across one recording:</p>

Bioacoustic analysis:
The vocal diagnosability criterion outlined by Isler et al. (
8 5
), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, was used to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Besides other oscine passerines (
73, 8 6
), this criterion has been employed as a bioacoustic species delimitation method across Asian birds such as owls (

58
, 
87

), pigeons (

50
, 
52
, 
88

), and nightjars (

89

). The Isler criterion has two parts which must be fulfilled in order to infer diagnosability. Firstly, the range of measurements of a parameter between two taxa must not exhibit overlap, and secondly, the data have to satisfy the following equation: 
xa
+ 
taSDa ≤xb–tbSDb,
where (
x
) refers to the respective means of measurements in taxon a and b, and 
ti
refers to the t-score at the 95th percentile of the t distribution for 
n-1
degrees of freedom. This is a stricter statistical test than the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (
8 5
) as it employs the standard deviation of the sample points instead of the taxon mean, allowing for the diagnosis of distinctions between taxa under more rigorous conditions. Successful Isler diagnosability is defined here as the presence of at least one vocally diagnostic parameter between taxa.

DNA extraction methods:
Fresh tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
was DNA- sequenced along with the following number of toepad scrapings of historical museum specimens: three of the Buru Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, three of the Seram Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and four of the Sulawesi Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
. All museum samples had been kindly contributed by the American Museum of Natural History (for voucher numbers, see 

and table S5). DNA extraction was carried out with the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extraction of the historic museum specimens’ toepad scrapings was conducted by trained personnel (CYG) in a room dedicated to ancient DNA extraction to preclude DNA contamination. The toepads were rinsed with water four times before extraction to ensure preservatives were removed, and DTT was added to facilitate digestion of keratin present in toepads. The concentrations of the DNA extracts were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay.
</p>
            <p>
DNA sequencing methods:
The holotype’s DNA extract was sheared into smaller fragments of ~250 base pairs (bp) using 13 cycles of 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off on a Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode, USA). Whole-genome library preparation for the holotype was carried out using a NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, USA) for Illumina according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the museum toepad extracts, the shearing step was omitted as the ancient DNA is already degraded and NEBNext FFPE DNA repair mix (New England Biolabs, USA) was added to each ancient DNA sample prior to library preparation to fix damage common to degraded DNA such as deamination, nicks and gaps. In addition, size selection of library preparation products was omitted for the toepad samples to reduce DNA loss from bead selection. A total of five PCR cycles were run on the holotype’s DNA extract and 12 PCR cycles on the toepads’ extracts. Whole-genome library preparation of toepad samples was carried out in a room with a PCR hood dedicated to ancient library preparation work. The concentrations and peak fragment sizes of the libraries were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay and an Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer (Agilent, USA), respectively. The peak fragment sizes of the historic museum samples and the fresh holotype (including adaptors and unique indexes) were ~230bp and ~380bp, respectively. All prepared libraries were sent to NovogeneAIT Genomics Singapore for Illumina sequencing using a HiSeq 4000 platform to produce 150bp paired-end reads.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial genome alignment
: Trimmomatic (version 0.33) (

90

) was used to remove adaptors and filter low quality reads (below 15 Phred quality score). We applied the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (version 0.7.15-r1140) (
9 1
) to align reads to a mitochondrial reference genome, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella pryeri
</tp:taxon-name>
(Genbank accession no.: NC_029151), with a minimum mapping quality score of 30. Samtools (version 1.9) (
9 2, 9 3
) was run to convert the SAM output files from the alignment to a BAM format for downstream analysis. Then Picard (version 2.18.21; http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) was employed to insert read groups and remove PCR duplicate artifacts. The BAM files were then imported into CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0.4 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com) for remapping to the same reference genome using the following mapping parameters: mismatch penalty of 1, insertion penalty of 1, and deletion penalty of 1. The reads were locally realigned at indel regions, and the consensus sequences were extracted at a minimum coverage threshold of 100. A mapping summary produced by Qualimap (version 2.2.1) (
9 4
) indicated that our mitochondrial genome coverage ranged between ~290–2920x for museum samples and ~6430x for the holotype (table S5). Sequences are deposited with GenBank at accession numbers 
MN597052
- 
MN597062
.
</p>
            <p>
Phylogenetic analysis
: The consensus sequences were exported in FASTA format and visually realigned in MEGA7 (

95

), producing a final whole-mitochondrial alignment of ~15,000bp. MEGA7 was used to construct a neighbor-joining tree based on uncorrected p- divergences and a maximum parsimony tree. Additionally, we ran raxmlGUI 1.5 beta (

96

) to construct a maximum likelihood tree using the GTRGAMMA model as specified by jModelTest (version 2.1.7) (

97

). All tree-building analyses were conducted with 10,000 bootstrap replicates. Pairwise uncorrected p-divergences across the mitogenomic alignment were calculated in MEGA7 with 10,000 bootstrap replicates.

            <p>Head and mantle down to uppertail coverts and to central belly are bright scarlet-red (7.5R 4/14) with subtle blackish suffusion owing to individual feathers having broad red distal half followed by black and then increasingly greyish basal half; jet-black narrow orbital ring and loral line. Upperwings, sides of mantle, scapulars and rectrices are matt black, with the remiges appearing slightly duskier black because of narrow olive edging to outer webs; underwing coverts and outer webs of the underside of remiges are whitish; a blackish-grey (N1.5) wedge extends from vent up to central belly.

The diagnosis refers to the adult male plumage only. Female 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals of the Wallacean radiation are generally very similar across species, and more research is needed to identify good distinguishing marks.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is an obvious, bright scarlet-and-black representative of the Wallacean grouping of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters that have often been united within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
complex (
6 1, 7 5
), but have been considered a radiation of independent species by more recent authors [e.g. (

57

)]. Within this radiation, the new species most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species has a more extensive and brighter red body and blacker wings, scapulars, and tail. Scarlet feathers in the new species are mostly black and grey at the base, with only the distal half scarlet, and with a sharp contrast between scarlet and black, lacking 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
’s narrow yellow bands in between the red and black portions of each individual feather that render the latter’s overall body more orange-tinted. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the red is not as extensive on the underparts, and the abdomen and vent are paler buff-white versus blackish-grey in the new species.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species is paler and greyer (not black) on vent and abdomen. It also has a smudgier scarlet body coloration (caused by the black and grey basal halves of individual feathers), with dark smudges especially pronounced on face and on breast sides, as compared to more uniform red underparts, head and mantle in 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
. Black lores in the new species are wider and not as clearly delimited as in 
<tp:taxon-name>

.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis

Etymology

</p>
            <p>We name this species after the village of Wahe (1.716°S, 124.843°E), which is the gateway to the highest elevations on Taliabu where it most commonly occurs. The species epithet is an indeclinable noun in apposition.</p>

Individual, age-related and sexual variation within taxon

</p>
            <p>
Two adult male specimens (holotype and 34.356) are virtually identical in coloration. Two additional male specimens (34.373 and 34.403), most likely immatures, are similar but have the scarlet body color replaced with a more rose-red hue (5R 4/14); they also do not exhibit any distinct olive margins of remiges. No comparative specimen material exists for adult females of the new species, which are generally similar among all regional 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species. Photos confirm that the female of the new species resembles other regional species (data not shown). One juvenile specimen (34.407) lacks red coloration and is generally drab grayish-brown (paler on underparts), becoming more intense earthen-brown on the mantle, rump and upperwing coverts, with the underside of remiges and rectrices mid-grey.

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
was first spotted by a University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 led by P.J. Davidson. Participants of this exploratory survey were probably the first ornithologists to visit the highlands of Taliabu between 600-800 m elevation (
64, 9 8
), where they found the new species predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m). FER then encountered the species commonly during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu between 4-18 April 2009 (

19
, 
48

), where we returned between 6-16 December 2013 to collect the holotype and accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has thus far only been found on the island of Taliabu within the Sula Archipelago. On Taliabu, we have recorded it from sea level to 1,300m (

19
, 
48

), and it presumably occurs further up all the way to the highest elevation at ~1,415m. The species inhabits forest canopy and edge habitat, and is a nectarivore and frugivore that has been photographed feeding at flowers (

48

). Akin to multiple other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species in Wallacea (

57

), the new species is seen far more often at higher elevations (roughly above ~800m) than in the lowlands. Davidson et al. (

64

), who first sighted this species, exclusively found it at higher elevations, mostly around ~800m, and we recorded it as “abundant” above 800m, whereas we have only had a handful of sightings in the lowlands. It is unknown to what extent elevational differences in abundance reflect the difficulty of detecting a canopy bird in tall lowland forest as compared to stunted montane forest. However, although detection difficulties may help mask its true abundance in the lowlands, we do not believe it is possible for the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
to be equally common across elevations given that other small canopy birds do not escape detection in the lowlands and are recorded commonly. In fact, the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
may even be a breeding endemic to montane elevations and only venture into the lowlands seasonally, following tree flowering and fruiting events. This potential seasonal displacement would explain why some expeditions have completely overlooked it in the lowlands while others have recorded it on occasion.
</p>
            <p>
It is contentious whether the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
is endemic to Taliabu, or also occurs on the other two main islands of the Sula Archipelago (Mangole and Sanana). The latter two have received even less ornithological attention than Taliabu, and to the best of our knowledge, the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has never been recorded there on recent ornithological expeditions (D. Yong, pers. comm.; J.A. Eaton, pers. comm.). Sanana is relatively low-lying (up to ~600m) and therefore likely to lack a number of Taliabu’s montane species. Mangole reaches its highest peak at 1,127m, but areas above 800m are confined to ~328 ha only, which gives it a comparatively small area of true montane forest. The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
’s level of dependence on vegetation at high elevations probably determines whether it would be capable of occurring on Mangole or even Sanana. Future fieldwork on those two islands will shed light on whether the new species occurs there or not.
</p>
            <p>
FER and Filip Verbelen first discovered a new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
population in the mountains of Peleng in the neighboring Banggai Archipelago during a visit between 23-30 March 2009 and recorded it as reasonably common at elevations between 700-900m in the western Peleng highlands (

49

). On our collecting expedition, we only had one aural encounter of this 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
on Peleng on 21 Dec 2013, indicating that the population might have been seasonally displaced or more retiring (

19

). However, photographic evidence from the 2009 visit indicates that the Peleng population has a plumage coloration that is very similar – if not identical – to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and quite different from 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
. As this Peleng population remains uncollected, future fieldwork will hopefully produce specimens allowing a determination whether there are differences between the Peleng birds and 
<tp:taxon-name>

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu is obviously a member of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, which used to be considered a single wide-ranging polytypic species for a long time (
6 1, 7 5
), but has now been divided into multiple monotypic island endemics by most recent authors on the basis of extensive plumage differences [e.g. (
57, 8 0, 99
)]. Within this radiation, its plumage most closely resembles that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, but is discrete from both of them in multiple characters (see Diagnosis). Its morphological differences from both 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
exceed those between other closely related species pairs within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. dammermani
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
(

73

). Therefore, its diagnosis here as a species level taxon rests on Mayr and Ashlock’s (

70

) yardstick approach, by which species status is conferred on the basis of divergences that exceed those of species pairs in which biologically important differences have been unequivocally demonstrated.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters have a wide vocal repertoire that is oftentimes problematic in the context of bioacoustic analysis (

73

). The Taliabu 
<tp:taxon-name>Myzomela</tp:taxon-name>
was hardly vocal during our encounters, and we do not consider vocalizations a fruitful taxonomic avenue in delimiting this new species from others. Instead, we have generated mitochondrial sequence data to further shed light on the new species’ taxonomic status.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial evidence
: Our mitochondrial tree analysis was based on sequences of the coding gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), comparing 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
to a great majority of members of the eastern and central Indonesian radiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters. Results indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
is most closely related to geographically adjacent species such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (

). Our analysis does not provide resolution on whether either 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
constitute the sister species to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
, and in fact, the latter two may well be sister to each other instead (

), rendering 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
a more basal species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from adjacent Buru is not represented in our mitochondrial dataset, and likely forms part of this group. Based on plumage coloration, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
is frequently considered to constitute the sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, and the two are sometimes merged under one species [e.g. (

99

)]. Therefore, we assume that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
– albeit closely related – will probably not emerge as the direct sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
in future analyses.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial ND2 divergence values between 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
and its two most closely related relatives (

<tp:taxon-name>M. elisabethae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chloroptera</tp:taxon-name>

) range between 3.5%–4.3% (

), well above the mitochondrial divergence threshold of 2-3% widely postulated in the literature (
10 0, 10 1
), providing additional support for species level recognition of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial analysis:
We extracted DNA from the breast muscle tissue of all our 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
material (n = 5), and from four independently collected 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
samples (

73

), using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. ND2 was then sequenced following Lim et al. (
10 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Using CodonCode Aligner version 8.0.2. (CodonCode, USA), our ND2 sequences were trimmed and assembled. These sequences of 991 bp length were then aligned in MEGA7 (
9 5
) with the ND2 sequences of 23 other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>The crown (from forehead to nape) is cold brown (2.5Y 2/2), delimited below by a narrow long white supercilium from bill base to napeside. Lores dark greyish brown (2.5Y 3/1) extending to just behind eye in the form of an eyestripe cutting through a broken white eye ring formed by small feathers peripheral to the eye. Black rictal bristles. Ear coverts and malar, facial and moustachial regions show white-and-dusky grizzling. Most of upperparts, including mantle, scapulars and rump, are mid-olive (5Y 4/4), while remiges are distinctly darker-olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). The white chin and throat are characterized by sporadic dusky speckles and lemon streaks increasing towards the lower throat, and grading into a fully lemon to sulphur yellow breast and belly (5Y 9/12). The yellow on the breast and belly has an olive-mottled appearance because of olive feather tips (5Y 4/4), especially pronounced towards the flanks, and white feather bases, especially pronounced towards the abdomen. The vent is solid lemon-yellow (5Y8/7). Iris dark-brown; bill black. Tarsus, toes and claws pinkish-grey with toepads paler yellowish.</p>

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The new species name is derived from “suara merdu” in Bahasa Indonesia, translating as “melodious voice”, referring to the pleasing vocalizations of this bird that FER heard hours before the first individual was seen, allowing for predictions prior to visual confirmation that this would be a new

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
During a visit to the highlands of Peleng between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently encountered this species at elevations between 700-900m (

49

). When hiking up to these elevations for the first time and hearing the melodious warble of this taxon in the distance, its superficial vocal resemblance to other members of the Wallacean 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation prompted FER to predict that this would be a new leaf-warbler taxon long before they laid their eyes on it. Once they first saw it, it was noticeable for its unusual behavior of frequently climbing along larger branches and trunks of trees in the manner of a treecreeper (
<tp:taxon-name>
Certhia
</tp:taxon-name>
). On our collecting expedition to Peleng between 18-23 Dec 2013, the species was less commonly encountered (

19

), probably because of seasonality.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new leaf-warbler is restricted to the highland forests of western Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago at elevations above 700m, reaching the highest island altitude above 1000m (

). Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago must be in serious doubt because only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, of which only 5 ha of land lie above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. Beyond the Banggai Archipelago,

Lemon ear coverts down to malar and moustachial regions (5Y 9/10) grizzled with dusky-olive feather edging, making for a mottled facial appearance. Upperparts from mantle and scapulars to rump are mid-olive (7.5Y 4/6). Remiges are distinctly darker- olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). Underparts from chin to vent are largely lemon to sulphur yellow, with white feather bases creating a more lemon-yellow hue on throat, breast and belly (7.5Y 8/8) and olive feather tips (5Y 4/4) generating a more olive- mottled appearance on flanks, while the undertail coverts are largely uniform lemon (5Y 9/12).</p>

<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
A University of East Anglia expedition by Davidson et al. (

64

) was the first to find a resident population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers on Taliabu, which they encountered commonly in montane forest and which they considered to represent an undescribed taxon. Rheindt (

48

) then studied this leaf warbler during his visit between 4-18 April 2009, and we found them again during our expedition between 6-16 Dec 2 013 and collected two (

19

).

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>
Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new warbler inhabits disturbed and undisturbed montane forest on Taliabu from 700m up to probably the highest elevations above 1,400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). It may also occur on the large neighboring island of Mangole, which rises to 1,127m and should harbor enough area of montane forest habitat above 700m to sustain a population. However, a lack of fieldwork in the mountains of Mangole means that there is no information available on its montane avifauna. The smallest main constituent of the Sula Archipelago, the densely populated island of Sanana, is unlikely to sustain any 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers as it barely reaches above 600m, which seems to be too low for this species. The species is replaced on the Banggai Archipelago by the newly described 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
(see SM5), while 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
replace it in various parts of Sulawesi. Given its more relaxed elevational requirements and its tolerance for disturbed habitat, this species is probably not as immediately endangered as some of the other montane Taliabu avifauna.

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
)


</p>
            <p>
The leaf-warbler genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
constitutes a large Old World radiation of small passerines that is exceptionally well-studied in phylogenetic terms (
10 6-1 09
). Recent demonstrations of genus paraphyly in combination with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
[summarized in (
10 8
)] have prompted a variety of new generic treatments, including a division into two re-defined genera [
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
; see (

57

)], but we here follow the latest phylogenetic treatise that suggests a merger of all 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
into a single genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
10 8
).
</p>
            <p>
Despite the genus’s well-known evolutionary history, a sizeable sub-clade of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Australasian (including Indonesian) Archipelago has largely been omitted from modern molecular insights. Notable exceptions include the first-ever example of a new avian species description (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. rotiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) partly based on genome-wide DNA data from the Timor region (
11 0
). However, most island populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
in this region have been merged into a limited number of ‘wastebasket species’, e.g. Mountain Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trivirgatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and Island Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
, although vocal and plumage differences among them often far exceed those documented among the better- studied continental groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
8 0
). As a consequence, some modern treatments [e.g. (

57

)] have adopted a ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) in which pairwise plumage and vocal differences between archipelagic taxa that are comparable in magnitude to those between better-studied continental species pairs (or exceed them) are interpreted as being indicative of species status. In this way, a number of highly distinct island taxa have been elevated to species level, such as Buru Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. everetti
, Seram Leaf Warbler
</tp:taxon-name>
               <tp:taxon-name>
P. ceramensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[a treatment that had previously been suggested on the basis of vocal and plumage comparisons; see (

80

)], and a number of additional Wallacean taxa. Our description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
follows this framework of affording species rank to taxa when vocal and plumage characters indicate deeper divisions. We also bring genome-wide DNA data to bear on the taxonomic classification of these two new species. However, following the yardstick approach as applied under the Biological Species Concept, we believe that biological characters, especially bioacoustic ones, will be the most important indicators when conferring species status in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers.
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: As for plumage characters, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
differ from each other and from surrounding taxa in a number of important traits (see Diagnosis for each taxon) which are far more salient than the plumage differences of often identical-looking species pairs on the Asian continent that are otherwise vocally and phylogenetically deeply diverged [e.g. the three members of the Arctic Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. borealis
</tp:taxon-name>
trio; (
11 1
)]. Most importantly, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
has a contrastingly white throat and supercilium and a grey-and-white grizzled auricular patch where all other surrounding taxa are much more yellowish, rendering it instantly recognizable in large series of specimens. In contrast, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is superficially reminiscent of Sulawesi Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
in its overall more yellowish coloration, displaying a phenotypic leapfrog pattern that has been documented from the Taliabu-Peleng-Sulawesi island trio on multiple previous occasions (
50, 7 2
). However, this superficial resemblance notwithstanding, it has important distinctions in bare-parts coloration and overall pigmentation (see Diagnosis), apart from obvious vocal differences.

Bioacoustic evidence
: In bioacoustic terms, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by melodious jumbles of 1–1.5sec, mostly at 2000–6000 Hz, with short individual high notes between 5000–7000 Hz occasionally interspersed. Song motifs generally lack repetitive element sequences or trills (

). In contrast, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by 1.5–3sec strophes mostly between 2000–6500 Hz (typically of a wider frequency range than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
) that constitute a melodious jumble often followed by a final repetitive phrase, which can sometimes be omitted (

). In this respect, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is slightly more reminiscent of the East Sulawesi population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng (despite the geographic proximity of the latter two). The 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
population on Gunung Tumpu (East Sulawesi) is often characterized by strong repetitive series at a very broad frequency range (2500–7000 Hz), mostly preceded by a variable but simple melodious series of elements between 2000–5000 Hz and a brief nasal note separating this variable series from the repetitive series (

). Depending on the presence or absence of components, the song rendition (=motif) can be 1.5–4sec long. In summary, the songs of these three forms (

<tp:taxon-name>P. suaramerdu</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. emilsalimi</tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
), while highly variable, are predictably different and strongly indicative of species status when put into the context of song differences among other 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
species (

).

Genomic evidence
: We generated a set of ~4,100 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment spanning almost 3 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial cytochrome- 
b
(cyt- 
b
) sequences, to shed light on the differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in separate Methods paragraphs below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three taxa (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
from East Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population-genomic space based on ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (

). The main division according to genomic PCA occurred between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
versus the other two taxa (PC1 in 

). The same relationship was strongly reflected in maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of concatenated genome-wide sequence alignments of almost 3 million base pairs length as well as in maximum-parsimony (MP) analysis of a concatenated set of ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (topology 1 in 

). In contrast, mitochondrial cyt- 
b
gene analysis and species-tree inference of genome-wide SNPs recovered a topology in which 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
were strongly supported sister lineages, with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
being more basal (topology 2 in 

). Depths of uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence (as determined by cyt- 
b
distances) were comparatively low across all three leaf-warblers (0.7-1.6%; 

).
</p>
            <p>
In summary, our phylogenomic analyses demonstrated considerable incongruence among tree topologies, including a strong mito-nuclear discordance that calls into doubt the reliability of mitochondrial divergence values in this dataset. For instance, the deepest genomic divergence was detected between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other two species (PC1 in 

), whereas on mitochondrial cyt- 
b
evidence 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
displayed some of the most shallow divergences from the other taxa (

). The use of mitochondrial divergences in species delimitation suffers from multiple confounding biases (
79, 10 0, 10 1
), especially when dealing with complexes containing closely-allied allopatric taxa that have a propensity for secondary gene flow (
11 2-11 4
). The best explanatory hypothesis for the pronounced mito- nuclear discordance in this dataset is that occasional overwater dispersal followed by hybridization and gene flow may have led to the introgression of foreign alleles in one or the other species, obfuscating clean branching patterns. Gene flow during sporadic hybridization is known to artifactually reduce mitochondrial divergences, masking deeper levels of genomic differentiation (

79

). Hence, introgression can account for the presence of relatively low mitochondrial divergences in a group of species characterized by comparatively deep genomic divergences and pronounced levels of bioacoustic differentiation [(

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted DNA from the fresh muscle tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and the three specimens collected by us (including the holotype) of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
, along with one individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
that we had collected on Mt Tumpu on the eastern peninsula of Sulawesi (

19

). Additional tissue samples were obtained from the American Museum of Natural History, New York (AMNH): three samples of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
from South Sulawesi and an outgroup sample of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus pallescens
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Solomon Islands. The AMNH samples were only used for phylogenomic rooting. DNA extraction was performed using the Exgene Clinic SV kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul) following the manufacturer’s instructions. We eluted the DNA in two consecutive rounds of 100μl molecular grade water. We prepared double-digest restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing (ddRADSeq) libraries using the same protocol as Garg et al. (
11 5
) with EcoRI and MspI as restriction enzymes. We quantified DNA and library product concentrations using the Qubit 2.0 Broad Range DNA Assay (Invitrogen, California), and used a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Iowa) to perform final quality checks on the library product. The genomic libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform at the Singapore Center for Environmental Life Science Engineering. Filtering and demultiplexing of the genomic data in STACKS 1.34 followed the same general procedures as detailed by Ng et al. (
7 2
), and are the result of comprehensive trials using a wide variety of different parameters and settings at each step of the analysis. DNA data is deposited with Genbank at BioProject accession number PRJNA566263.
</p>
            <p>
SNP calling and genomic supermatrix generation:
Reference genome alignment was performed using BWA 0.7.12 (
9 1
) and samtools 0.1.19 (http://samtools.sourceforge.net) (
9 2, 9 3
) on the Greenish Warbler (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
) genome (
11 6
), the most closely related available full genome. We performed SNP calling in STACKS 1.34 as per Ng et al. (
7 2
). We required loci to be present across all individuals, and retained one random SNP per locus to exclude obviously linked SNP loci. Subsequently, we used PLINK 1.9 (
11 7
) and Bayescan 2.1 (
11 8
) to filter SNPs for linkage disequilibrium and signs of selection. Data format manipulation and conversions were performed with PGDSpider (
1 19
). The final filtered dataset totaled 4,104 SNPs. In addition, we created concatenated SNP datasets for each group for use in downstream maximum parsimony analysis.
</p>
            <p>
Following the procedures used by Ng et al. (
7 2
), we generated a concatenated read supermatrix without missing data using pyRAD (
12 0
). We stipulated a minimum required locus coverage of 20, and kept the clustering threshold within and between reads at the default of 0.88. The final concatenated read supermatrix amounted to 2,861,661 bp in length, generated from 19,985 loci.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial sequence generation:
We sequenced cyt- 
b
using the primers H16065 (
12 1
) and L14995 (
12 2
), with 40 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 72°C. We conducted PCR product cleanup with ExoSAP-IT 
®
and used the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) for cycle- sequencing. Sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer using capillary electrophoresis. We assembled cyt- 
b
sequences with CodonCode Aligner 4.1 and aligned them with ClustalW (
12 3
). The final cyt- 
b
alignment was 1,100bp long, indel- free and fully translatable. Mitochondrial sequences have been deposited with Genbank at accession numbers 
MN518858
- 
MN518862
.
</p>
            <p>
Population structure inference:
In order to test for the presence of geographic structuring across East Sulawesi, Peleng, and Taliabu, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the genomic SNP data. PCA was performed using ade4 (
12 4
) and factoextra (
12 5
), both available as R packages (
12 6
).
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial tree inference:
We constructed phylogenetic cyt- 
b
trees using two methods: maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML). We ran MP analyses using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
), performing 10,000 bootstrap replicates. For ML analyses, we first used jModelTest v2.1.6 (

97

) and determined that the Jukes-Cantor model (
12 8
) was the best performing substitution model. We then ran RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) using the extensive subtree-pruning-regrafting tree search algorithm.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic tree inference:
We applied three different genomic tree inference analyses: coalescent-based species tree inference (applied to the SNP dataset), maximum likelihood tree inference (applied to concatenated read supermatrix), and maximum parsimony tree inference (applied to the concatenated SNP dataset). We performed species tree inference using SNAPP (
1 29
) as implemented in BEAST 2.3.0, performing two iterations using default settings. Tracer 1.6 was used after each iteration to ensure that the runs had reached convergence, after which LogCombiner v2.3.0 and DensiTree (
13 0
) were used to process results. We carried out ML tree inference using RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) on the concatenated read supermatrix using the general-time-reversible gamma-invariant (GTRGAMMA) model and performed 1,000 rapid bootstrap searches. Finally, we conducted conventional MP analysis on the concatenated SNPs of each taxon set, using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
) and running 10,000 bootstrap replicates to evaluate branch support.

Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts are bronzy olive (2.5Y 3/4), the remiges and rectrices slightly darker and with more coppery edging (10YR 4/6). Dull white on breast reaches to chin, with an orange-rufescent tinge (7.5YR 7/6) surrounding the breast laterally and ventrally. Yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, with a rufescent-orange suffusion to flanks (7.5YR 7/6). Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Dark-horn mandible. Yellow-orange tarsus on live bird.

One of the phenotypically most distinct subspecies of the Mountain Tailorbird or Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Uniquely among all subspecies, the new taxon has a rufescent suffusion on throat and breast, becoming especially pronounced on breast sides and auriculars (from where it grades into the rufous crown), rendering the bird’s anterior aspect much warmer-tinged than all other subspecies. The upperparts, especially upper wings, are also warmer bronzy and the flanks tinged more rufescent than all other subspecies, making this the most reddish-looking taxon in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. It additionally differs from most other subspecies (except those from Sulawesi and Peleng) in the rufous crown’s more posterior extension to the nape and in the absence of a pale supercilium.
</p>
            <p>
It further differs from

(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis

malayanus

riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow on belly and lower breast (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near- complete absence of yellow, respectively). For additional differences from the new subspecies on Peleng, see SM8.

Davidson et al. (

<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoiler (then called an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird) for Taliabu, and characterized the population as inhabiting montane forest above 500m and possibly in need of taxonomic description. FER found this population commonly in disturbed montane forest to over 1,100 m, with a few records in dense secondary bamboo thickets down to 50m (

48

), and our collecting expedition re-encountered this form abundantly at elevations around 1,300m (

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, this new subspecies is currently only known from Taliabu in the Sula Archipelago. There, it inhabits disturbed situations (forest edge, bamboo thickets) mostly in the mountains, with the highest record at 1300m, but presumably ranging to the highest point at over 1400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). On other islands, mountain leaftoilers rarely range lower than ~500m (

57

), but Rheindt (

48

) exceptionally recorded the new taxon on Taliabu from an extensive bamboo thicket at ~50m, demonstrating that this population may tolerate lower elevations. The presence of this leaftoiler on the other two main Sula islands, Mangole and Sanana, is likely, especially on the former, which rises to over 1,100m, but perhaps also on the latter, which reaches to a little over 600m. However, it has probably been overlooked owing to a lack of fieldwork at higher elevations on these two islands. On the Banggai Archipelago, the species is represented by another novel subspecies (see below) that replaces 
sulanus
there. Its predilection for disturbed forest situations and wide elevational tolerance as compared to other insular mountain birds probably means that it is currently not of conservation concern.

Crown and nape rich rufous (2.5YR 4/10), slightly darker posteriorly, and not extending as far onto the nape as in the new Taliabu subspecies (
P. c. sulanus
; see SM7). Short blackish eyestripe. Facial region from auriculars to lores dusky-grey (N3) with an increasing rufous suffusion (concolorous with crown) towards the malar and moustachial regions. Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts olive with a slight bronzy hue (5Y 3/4), colder-colored than in the new subspecies from Taliabu (
P. c. sulanus
). Remiges and rectrices are darker and duskier, but with outer edging nearly concolorous with mantle. Underparts are bicolored, with a white chin to breast, and a lemon-yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, and with a dusky olive suffusion on the flanks. Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Tarsus dark-yellow. On the live bird, the upper mandible was black with a yellow tip, and the lower mandible was black with a yellow base and tip. The iris color was not clearly discerned on the live bird.

            <p>
A distinct new subspecies of Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(or ‘Mountain Tailorbird’), differing from adjacent subspecies to the east and to the west in important discrete characters.
</p>
            <p>
The lack of a supercilium and the posterior extension of the rufous crown coloration onto the mid-nape set this subspecies apart from most other subspecies, except those from Sulawesi and Taliabu, which have an equally or sometimes even slightly more extensive rufous crown. It further differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis
(Borneo), 
malayanus
(Malay Peninsula) and all subspecies further west and north in the absence of a strong grey hindcollar band and/or strongly grey breast sides; from 
<tp:taxon-name>
batjanensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(Bacan Island) in its lemon-yellow belly lacking a strong olive suffusion; and from 
dumasi
(Seram and Buru) in its much less brown-colored upperparts. In many aspects, the new taxon is similar to the set of subspecies on Sulawesi (
riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow belly (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near-complete absence of yellow, respectively).
</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies shares many unique traits with the new subspecies from Taliabu 
sulanus
(see SM7), but differs significantly in its darker chestnut crown and its less reddish overall appearance, largely lacking a rufescent suffusion to the breast and flanks, and showing much less rufescent on the auriculars; its flanks are also much colder olive-washed (versus warmly rufescent-washed), and the upperparts and especially upper wings are colder bronze-olive. On live birds, the legs are much darker and less intensely colorful than those of birds from Taliabu.

FER and Filip Verbelen first encountered and documented the new subspecies during a visit to the highlands of western Peleng between 22-31 March 2009 (

Typical of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers, this new taxon is restricted to forest edge situations, treefall gaps and bamboo thickets in montane forest on the island of Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago. During our combined visits to the island (

19
, 
49

), we recorded this new taxon from 750m to the highest point at over 1000m elevation. It may, therefore, not range as low as the new taxon from neighboring Taliabu, although future fieldwork may well produce lower elevational records. Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago is unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new subspecies. Despite its very small range, its predilection for disturbed forest situations probably means that it is not particularly negatively affected by the current degradation that is impacting most highland forests of western Peleng.

Taxonomic rationale (combined for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus sulanus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
P. c. relictus
)


</p>
            <p>
The Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
was previously thought to be an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird and then called Mountain Tailorbird. We here acknowledge the distant relationship to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbirds (
13 1
) and therefore follow the recent trend of calling members of this species ‘leaftoilers’ rather than tailorbirds [e.g. (

57

)], a fitting translation from their re- instated scientific genus name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
. As for the species name 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, we follow the recently proposed emendation (

6

) of the original spelling of the name (‘ 
cuculatus’
) on the basis of information in the original description showing that the name was meant to refer to the birds’ hooded appearance (from Latin cucullus – hood).
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: The new subspecies 
sulanus
from Taliabu is arguably one of the most distinctly-colored, if not the single most distinctly-colored subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(see Diagnosis) and is therefore well-deserving of subspecies status. Its reddish-suffused anterior body renders it instantly recognizable among any series of specimens. Although not as unique in morphology, we also describe 
relictus
from Peleng at the subspecific level mainly on the basis of its distinct coloration. In plumage distinctness, 
relictus
far exceeds several other previously recognized subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, such as 
P. c. cinereicollis
.
</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic evidence
: We have been unsuccessful in procuring a sufficiently large sample set of song recordings of the two new subspecies, precluding rigorous bioacoustic analysis. However, we note that the songs given by these two subspecies in the field did not strike us as very different from the songs of other subspecies we are familiar with. Song playback with recordings from several other islands elicited a ready response at least in 
P. c. relictus
. Based on our bioacoustic experience with Indonesian passerines, we do not have the impression that song differences of the two new subspecies would warrant anything but a subspecific treatment at the present time.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic evidence
: We created a set of ~8,500 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment of over 2 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase intron 2 (ND2) sequences, to investigate levels of differentiation among 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in a separate Methods paragraph below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three subspecies (
P. c. stentor
from eastern Sulawesi, 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng and 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population- genomic space (

). The main genomic division according to a PCA based on ~8,500 SNPs occurred between 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu versus the other two subspecies (PC1 in 

). In contrast to the leaf-warbler analysis (see SM6), this main genomic division among leaftoilers was also supported by the mitochondrial tree and the genomic ‘species tree’ (

), consistently placing 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng close to 
P. c. stentor
from Sulawesi, although the concatenated tree built from genome-wide loci was in conflict, placing 
P. c. relictus
closer to 
P. c. sulanus
. Coincidentally, the majority tree with a basal placement of 
sulanus
(topology 1 in 

) is also the arrangement that would be supported by the extraordinarily divergent plumage of 
sulanus
, making it unique among all leaftoiler subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
Pairwise divergences between the subspecies (as determined by ND2 distances) were relatively low (0.3-1.7%; 

), at levels generally accepted to be below the species threshold for birds [(~2-3%; (
100, 10 1
)], consistent with the current proposed subspecies status. These ND2 divergences further supported the majority tree (topology 1 in 

) by consistently rendering 
P. c. sulanus
as the most deeply diverged subspecies (up to ~1.7%), whereas 
P. c. relictus
and 
P. c. stentor
emerged as only 0.3% diverged.
</p>
            <p>
In summary, mitochondrial sequence analysis, PCA of genome-wide SNPs and ‘species-tree’ analysis all agree in placing 
P. c. sulanus
basal to the other two subspecies, an arrangement supported by its distinct plumage. Therefore, we have no reason to suspect bias in the mitochondrial divergence depth (unlike in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
, see SM6), which supports our bioacoustic assessment that both 
relictus
and 
sulanus
are at the subspecies level. Future studies of the uniquely colored 
P. c. sulanus
may yet challenge this assessment.
</p>
            <p>
Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted genomic DNA of all tissue material available for 
P. c. sulanus
(n=5) and 
P. c. relictus
(n=2), along with two samples of 
P. c. stentor
that we had independently collected on Mt Tumpu on the adjacent eastern Sulawesi peninsula (

19

). Tissue of a single individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cettia parens
</tp:taxon-name>
from Makira in the Solomon Islands, provided by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was also extracted to serve as an outgroup in phylogenomic rooting. Laboratory and analytical protocols followed our procedures outlined in SM6 (under 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
), utilizing the same reference genome (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
), but using a minimum stack depth of 5 in STACKS 1.34 and a minimum required locus coverage of 5 in pyRAD due to differences in sequencing quality. The final filtered dataset for the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers totaled 8,515 SNPs and the final concatenated read supermatrix was 2,002,726 bp long, generated from 13,194 separate loci. For mitochondrial analysis, we sequenced ND2 using the primers L5219Met and H6313Trp (
13 2
) with 35 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 50-53°C, but otherwise following the procedures as outlined in SM6. The final ND2 alignment for the leaftoilers was 1,015bp long, indel-free and fully translatable. All DNA data has been deposited with Genbank at accession number PRJNA566263 and 
MN518850

Hartert, 1920 (‘extremely neglected’) from Selayar Island, were based on the impression that the description of these birds had escaped the attention of researchers for too long. The presently described taxon, only discovered in the 21

century, fulfils that criterion even more adequately, so we take pleasure in naming it 
omississimus
(‘the most neglected’), superlative of ‘omissus’.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The immature plumage remains undocumented. The only two male specimens known to exist (holotype and MZB.Ornit.34.488) show minimal plumage variation, the only difference perhaps being the latter specimen’s slightly brighter, more brilliant rump and darker, more blackish tarsus and claws in life.</p>
            <p>As compared to males, the three female specimens have a duller blue supercilium (but still discernible), lack a black chin, have prominent rufous spectacles over a narrow blackish stripe through the cere, the rufous continuing to the lower sides of the face where it is finely speckled dark (in two of three females the speckling continues to the throat sides), and have much less dark blackish-blue auriculars, contrasting less with the rufous throat. The female’s upperparts are less brilliant blue. One of the three female specimens is slightly paler on the tarsus and claws.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new subspecies was first reported by Indrawan et al. (
13 3
), who documented the sighting of a female on 15 May 2001 and a male on 29 July 2001 at 50-100m elevation around Benteng on the main island of Togian, and pointed out that this new population may be an undescribed subspecies. Following their footsteps, Filip Verbelen (pers. comm.) made the first sound recordings of the new population in December 2008 when studying a few individuals on Kadidiri, a tiny forested tourist resort island off the coast of Togian measuring ~4km in length and less than 1km in width. A few days later, F. Verbelen moved to Batudaka, one of the three main islands of the archipelago, where he found additional individuals in coastal forest near the capital town of Wakai. FER visited Batudaka Island from 23-27 April 2009 and observed this new population. On our collecting trip, we visited Batudaka from 24-28 Dec 2013 and found this taxon to be common in the forests outside the capital town of Wakai, collecting the present material in the process (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>The new subspecies is known from the Togian Archipelago in the Gulf of Tomini, a satellite group of islands between the northern and eastern peninsulas of Sulawesi. More specifically, to the best of our knowledge the new subspecies has so far been found on the two main islands of Togian and Batudaka, as well as on the tiny islet of Kadidiri off Togian, where it is common in remnant forest and edge from near sea level to at least ~200m elevation. However, it is likely that the birds occur up to the highest elevations at ~430m on these islands. More field research is required to map this subspecies’ occurrence on other islands in this archipelago. Its presence on some of the larger, forest-covered islands in close proximity to Batudaka and Togian, such as Talatakoh, Waleakodi and Waleabahi, is virtually guaranteed, given its occurrence on tiny Kadidiri. However, its presence on slightly more distant islands, such as Puah (at ~18km from the main archipelago) and Unauna (at ~28km from the main archipelago) is less certain, although these latter islands are connected to the main archipelago by shallow sea-beds not exceeding 120m depth, indicating that they would have been connected with one another during glacial sea level recessions.</p>
            <p>
On the main island of Sulawesi, the newly described 
omississimus
is replaced by the nominate taxon 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Unusually, however, the nominate form on Sulawesi is a hill and montane forest denizen, occurring from 500-2300m elevation and shunning lowland forest habitats in stark contrast to the new subspecies.
</p>
            <p>The new subspecies appears to be moderately tolerant to habitat disturbance where small-scale timber extraction leads to a secondarization of primary forest. However, the taxon disappears where forest is converted into agricultural land. Although Togian’s forests are quickly dwindling, with most remnants by now secondary and restricted to inland locations away from the coast, far more than half of the islands should still be suitable for the new taxon, making it safe for the time being.</p>

            <p>
Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The proposed English name of this new taxon follows a recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] to call members of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
‘jungle-flycatchers’ rather than ‘blue-flycatchers’ because molecular data (
13 4
) and bioacoustic considerations (
57, 7 4
) strongly suggest a merger of many members of the previously recognized jungle-flycatcher genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinomyias
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Given that numerous species in the resultant genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
are no longer blue but entirely brown, the name ‘blue-flycatcher’, while formerly appropriate, is no longer suitable for this genus.
</p>
            <p>
Although distinguishable from other subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
in terms of plumage characters (see Diagnosis), 
omississimus
is quite similar to them in general coloration. At any rate, plumage coloration is not an ideal taxonomic indicator in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
jungle-flycatchers, many of which boast a highly conserved male plumage sporting blue upperparts and reddish underparts. Other characters, such as bioacoustic and genetic ones, may be more conducive to guiding taxonomic decision-making in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
We recently published a bioacoustic comparison on the basis of six vocal parameters among members of the greater 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, showing that the song of the newly described 
omississimus
from Togian exhibits considerable vocal overlap with the songs of all three analyzed subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
, while distinctly differing from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. kalaoensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[see 

in (
7 4
)]. This vocal evidence along with Togian’s proximity to Sulawesi suggest a placement of 
omississimus
as a subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Based on a lack of deep differentiation in both bioacoustic and genetic evidence, we propose to classify this new taxon at the subspecies level. Upon first discovery in the field, we were generally impressed by its lowland forest occurrence, which stands in contrast to the montane forest requirements of the nominate subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi. This pronounced difference in habitat preference was given much weight in supporting species- level recognition of the new Togian population in a recently published field guide to the region (

57

). However, given Gwee et al.’s (
7 4
) newly published data, the latter treatment has ultimately proved erroneous.

in its lack of solid white or rufous on the belly; its uniform dark-brown coloration in which only the underparts show a faint warm tinge; and its unmarked dark-brown vent. The new subspecies has a darker hood and breast than the above-mentioned taxa except for the intensely rufous-bellied 
fumidus
and perhaps 
hygroscopus
. It also differs from 
deningeri
from Seram in its paler, browner (less black) body color, with a darker non-contrasting hood, and differs from 
schlegelii
and 
sterlingi
(both from Timor) in its less olive overall coloration and lack of rufous belly and vent.
</p>
            <p>
Within Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely resembles the much larger and longer-winged 
versteegi
and 
papuensis
from Papua but is dark slaty-brown (versus black) in overall body color and has an unmarked vent. The lower underparts have more extensive and paler-cinnamon feather margins in the new subspecies versus narrower, more rufous feather margins in the Papuan forms.
</p>
            <p>
Among geographically more distant Island Thrush subspecies from outside of Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely approaches three taxa from the Solomon Islands (
bougainvillei, kulambangrae, sladeni)
and two taxa from the Bismarck Archipelago (
heinrothi, beehleri
), but lacks those subspecies’ blackish overall body color. It also superficially resembles 
nigrorum
from Negros (Philippines), but the latter subspecies’ lower belly grades into whitish on the vent while the new subspecies is uniformly dark on those parts. Furthermore, another Philippine subspecies, 
kelleri
from Mt Apo (Mindanao), is similar to the new subspecies but becomes darker brown towards the front of the head while the new subspecies has a nearly uniform head coloration becoming slightly paler on the forehead.

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The subspecies name, translated from Bahasa Indonesia “it likes the rain” (=suka hujan), refers to the circumstances surrounding the bird’s discovery. On FER’s first expedition to the highest parts of Taliabu (

48

), heavy persistent rain impeded bird observations, leading to a decision to abort the expedition ahead of schedule. On his premature descent, FER then spotted a hardy individual of the new thrush, perched in the pouring rain, leading him to change plans yet again and mount a subsequent second and eventually third expedition to these elevations in better weather. This latter third expedition then allowed for a more detailed documentation of Taliabu’s distinct novel montane avifauna (

19
, 
48

). The name 
sukahujan
is treated as an inalienable noun in apposition.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>All nine specimens procured resemble one another considerably in coloration. The greatest variation occurs in the tone of the lower breast and abdomen, which is intermediate in the holotype but ranges from all-drab brownish grey throughout with almost no warm edging (in MZB.Ornit.34.416) to more extensive cinnamon feather edging (in most adult females, especially MZB.Ornit.34.409), the latter leading to an overall warmer underparts impression. Females are variably slightly less slaty on upperparts and crown, and one adult individual (MZB.Ornit.34.416) of unknown sex has a male-like slaty tone on upperparts but a female- like crown color that is more suffused with dull brown. Two juveniles (MZB.Ornit.34.410; MZB.Ornit.34.417) exhibit noticeable mottling on their mantle and underparts coloration, caused by dark brownish-black feather margins contrasting against the paler (on underparts sometimes warm cinnamon) feather centers.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new taxon was first discovered on 8 and 9 April 2009 by FER near its type locality on the occasion of a hike to the highest elevations on Taliabu that was cut short by heavy rainfall. Subsequent sightings on 14 and 15 April 2009 were made in the same area on the occasion of a return visit (

48

). We found this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected the type along with the accompanying specimens.

<tp:taxon-name>
T. poliocephalus

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
With approximately 50 subspecies, the Island Thrush 
<tp:taxon-name>
Turdus poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
is arguably the most polytypic bird species on Earth (
13 5
). Attempts to separate this variable species complex into smaller species-level lineages [e.g. (
13 6
)] have been called into question by genetic data showing that plumage characters are not a good predictor of close relationships in this complex (
13 7
). Hence, modern sources generally continue to unite all or most subspecies into one polytypic species. Not unlike some Philippine subspecies previously under study (
13 7
), the new subspecies from Taliabu is phenotypically extremely different from neighboring forms but more closely resembles certain geographically distant subspecies. It is presently best accommodated at the subspecies level. Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic inquiries are needed in the future to assess whether any internal species limits must be drawn within the complex. Such future analyses may well elevate the Taliabu Island Thrush to species level. However, such analyses are currently hampered by a lack of crucial comparative DNA material.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Forehead to crown and nape dark slaty blue (2.5PB 2/2) with slightly scaly appearance generated through narrow black feather centres; the same color, but without the scaly appearance, then continues through mantle and scapulars to rump. A white supercilium starts above the centre of the eye and ends just shy of the bill base, becoming narrower towards the front. A black facial patch centred in the loral region and below the supercilium to the chin (with narrow rows of black feathers above the bill base) grades into dark slaty blue coloration (2.5PB 1.5/2) towards the auriculars and the malar and moustachial regions, merging with the nape and mantle. Upperwing coverts largely concolorous with crown, with vestiges of an extremely indistinct brighter carpal patch visible with difficulty on this specimen. Remiges are dark slaty brown (10YR 2.5/1), the larger primaries with warmer, paler outer edging (10YR 4/2). Breast intensely rufous (7.5YR 7/12), becoming slightly paler on throat and upper flanks, and becoming pale cinnamon-whitish on belly and lower flanks (7.5YR 9/4), and eventually off-white on undertail coverts. Tail dull black on upper side, blackish-grey (N2) on underside, with indistinct white base to outermost rectrices. Iris dark-brown; legs light-pink; black bill with pinkish gape flange on live bird.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
An unequivocal member of the Snowy-browed Flycatcher 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ficedula hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
, and one of its most easterly outposts, with minor plumage distinctions in the male and major plumage distinctions in the female, a combination of which conclusively demarcates this new taxon from other subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
The male subtly differs from adjacent insular subspecies to the south and to the west, namely from the two Sulawesi subspecies (
jugosae, annalisa
), from 
sumatrana
(Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo), from 
vulcani
(Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores), and from 
alifura
(Buru), in the reduction of white patches at the base of the outer tail feathers, and in the slightly less extensive rufous underparts, replaced on the belly by pale cinnamon- whitish. In contrast, males of the only subspecies to the east and north (
pallidipectus
from Bacan Island) are markedly paler on the underparts than the males of this new subspecies, and have more contrastingly olive flanks. The white supercilium in males of the new subspecies is narrower than that of at least 
sumatrana, vulcani
, and 
alifura
.
</p>
            <p>
The female is highly distinct from most subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
in her bluish (versus olive, brown or grey-brown) upperparts coloration, extensive cold-brown mottling on breast (versus little to none), and a washed-out face pattern ghosting that of the male, with a whiter (versus rufous) brow. The only other subspecies that equals female 
F. h. betinabiru
in her bluish tinge to the upperparts is 
alifura
from adjacent Buru, in which the back color is ever so slightly brighter-blue. Compared to the new subspecies, the female of 
alifura
exhibits a more rufous (less white) eye brow, and brighter and more extensive rufous underparts with less brown mottling.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>
Only adult specimens have been procured, although a photo of a 
pullus
near the nest suggests an early juvenile plumage similar to other subspecies. Among adults, tarsus color as recorded in the field on live birds appears to vary individually from light-pink to pinkish-horn.
</p>
            <p>There is minor variation among the nine adult male specimens procured in the lower extent of the rufous breast, the intensity of the cinnamon wash to the belly, thickness of the supercilium and the extent of vestigial white patches on the basal outer rectrices. There is minor variation among the five adult female specimens in the intensity of brown mottling on the underparts, width and paleness of the supercilium and the presence or absence of a slight brownish tinge to the lowermost mantle portion.</p>

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies of Snowy-browed Flycatcher was first encountered by the University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 (
64, 9 8
). Members of that survey found the new taxon predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m) and suggested that it may be a novel subspecies. FER then saw one adult male at 1100m during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu on 5 April 2009 (

48

). We returned to this general area between 6-16 December 2013, where we found 
betinabiru
as one of the most common constituents of the forest interior understorey avifauna and collected the type and accompanying individuals at ~1300m (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
Subspecies 
betinabiru
is currently only known from the understorey of dense montane forest in the highlands of Taliabu at above 800m elevation (
19, 48, 64, 9 8
). Extensive logging has occurred across the highlands of Taliabu, with some parts of the mountains additionally affected by large-scale forest fires (see Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler account in SM3; 

). As an understory inhabitant, 
betinabiru
would be particularly susceptible to this kind of habitat degradation and is therefore probably declining. Nevertheless, it remains extremely common where good habitat persists, as indicated by our high mistnet capture rates (

19

).
</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, Snowy-browed Flycatchers have not been detected on the two other main islands of the Sula Archipelago, although their occurrence is possible at least on Mangole, which rises to 1,127m, while very unlikely on Sanana, which does not rise taller than ~600m. If confirmed on Mangole, it is likely that the local population would refer to the same subspecies 
betinabiru
.
</p>
            <p>
On the adjacent Banggai Archipelago, a single Snowy-browed Flycatcher was recorded once in April 2009 at 800-900m on the tallest island of Peleng (

49

). To the best of our knowledge, there have not been subsequent records from this island despite extensive fieldwork. In the absence of photos or closer details about the single Peleng record, it is impossible to ascertain whether the Peleng population is ascribable to 
betinabiru
, to one of the two Sulawesi races (
annalisa, jugosae
) or to a novel unnamed subspecies.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We describe this new taxon on the basis of its characteristic plumage (especially in females). These plumage distinctions certainly warrant a description at the subspecific level as they exceed those of several more poorly marked subspecies within this complex (e.g. 
annalisa
[Stresemann, 1931], which only subtly differs from 
jugosae
[Riley, 1921]). Bioacoustic variation in this species complex is poorly explored, but the high-pitched courtship vocalization of the new subspecies superficially resembles that of many other subspecies, and playback of songs from other subspecies elicits a ready response from members of this population. Genetic differences between the new taxon and other subspecies remain unexplored.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Crown, nape, ear coverts and neck sides are mid-brown (7.5YR 4/2), with a distinct cinnamon-chestnut forehead extending over eye (7.5YR 4/8). Black rictal bristles. Nape color slowly grading into warmer cinnamon-rufous (2.5YR 4/10) across mantle, scapulars and rump to the basal 60% portion of tail. The outer remiges are mostly dark dusky-brown (7.5YR 2/1), becoming paler and more olive-brown (7.5YR 4/2) towards the inner remiges. All remiges have narrow but intense rufous outer edging concolorous with rump and lower back color. The wing coverts are almost identical to the inner remiges in color, with an increasing intensity and width of bright-rufous feather tipping towards the median and lesser coverts. The distal 40% of the tail is greyish-black (N2), with paler rufous tips (5YR 5/6) on the underside only. Chin and throat form a white triangle delimited below by a conspicuous large black breast patch. A diffuse band of grey coloration (N5) with a black scaly appearance created by black feathers with narrow grey edging demarcates the black breast patch on its lower side. The belly is pale buff (7.5YR 9/8), grading into a richer, fuller hue on the flanks and undertail coverts (7.5YR 5/6). The iris is dark-brown, the bill black with a pinkish base to the lower mandible, and the tarsus on the live bird was described as pinkish- horn.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A mid-sized, rufous-toned 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura
</tp:taxon-name>
typical of a radiation of fantails distributed throughout Australasia. It most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
(

57

), and constitutes the third member of this radiation. Its plumage distinctions from the other two species are subtle yet consistent. However, the most characteristic distinction is its unique courtship vocalization (
7 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, the new species differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Sula Islands in its much narrower, less distinct rufous tips to the underside of the rectrices, in its more distinct black scaling below the black breast patch, and in its more strongly cinnamon-buff (less white) central underparts. The new species’ throat is cleaner white, less interspersed with dusky tips to the feathers.
</p>
            <p>
The new species differs from all three subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi in its wider black portion of the tail and its warmer brown crown and upper mantle. When compared to the geographically most closely adjacent subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni toradja
</tp:taxon-name>
from eastern and central Sulawesi, the new species additionally differs in its cleaner white throat and slightly less conspicuous scaling below the black breast patch, while it is additionally distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
of the Lompobattang Massif in South Sulawesi by its blacker breast patch and by the richer chestnut (less cinnamon) coloration of its brighter body parts (such as supercilium, rear upperparts, flanks and vent).

Etymology

</p>
            <p>The new species’ epithet is in honor of the late Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie (deceased 11 Sep 2019), the third president of the Republic of Indonesia. President Habibie was known as a keen environmentalist and contributed greatly to the science and conservation of nature in Indonesia.</p>

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The only three specimens (all adult; one female, two males) exhibit limited variation in terms of extent of breast patch and black mottling below breast patch that may have been caused by the preparation of the specimens.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new species has doubtless been known to the local inhabitants of Peleng Island for a long time. Mochamad Indrawan was presumably the first outside ornithologist to see this new bird when encountering a dead individual during his work on Peleng in the mid-2000s and re- encountering the species in the wild on several undated occasions (

49

). During a field trip between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently observed the species near the type locality (

49

), where we returned from 18-23 Dec 2013 to collect the type and the accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new species is restricted to montane forest on the island of Peleng, the largest landmass in the Banggai Archipelago, at elevations not lower than 750m (

19
, 
49

) (

). Over two longer visits to the highlands of Peleng, we found that the species becomes gradually more common towards higher elevations before it seems to drop out somewhere slightly below the tallest peak on Peleng at 1,022m. The new species is replaced on Sulawesi to the west by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
, and on the Sula Archipelago to the east by 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Its occurrence on other islands of the Banggai Archipelago is highly unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
must be considered threatened given the small extent of its occurrence and the continuing loss of its habitat. Only 25,071 ha of land on Peleng fall above the approximate 750m elevational cutoff, most of it formerly constituting a single contiguous block of highland forest (

). However, our own observations in combination with satellite imagery indicate extensive forest loss to small-scale agriculture and logging by burgeoning village communities. Google Earth’s present coverage of the area is mixed, with large swathes covered by insufficient or outdated (e.g., 2004) imagery. However, given current satellite coverage, a conservative estimate is that 9,987 ha (~40%) from within the elevational range of

have either been completely deforested or constitute young regrowth or unviable forest fragments surrounded by clearings. This would leave only 15,084 ha of more or less undisturbed primary or older secondary forest. Recent observations indicate, however, that this extent of forest loss is probably an underestimate. After the first discovery of this species and a number of other new bird taxa on Peleng (

49

), the island became a destination for an average of 1-3 international adventure and birdwatching tour groups per year, which considerably helped spur the local economy of the village near the type locality (name withheld). While this sort of ecotourism has a positive impact on the natural environment in many reported cases, on Peleng the sudden influx of tourist dollars led to observations of increased logging and expansion of infrastructure, prompting the rapid destruction of forest at the original type locality over the last five years. In the near future, it will be of paramount importance for the survival of Peleng’s unique montane fauna to find ways in which the influx of eco-tourism dollars can create incentives for conservation.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
Based on its plumage coloration, the new species is clearly a member of the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, hitherto known from Sulawesi and the Sula Archipelago (

57

). The discovery of a new constituent of this radiation on the Banggai Archipelago closes the geographic gap between Sulawesi and Sula. Most previous taxonomic treatises (e.g. 
6 1, 7 5
) have regarded all members of this radiation as conspecific, and indeed plumage differences are relatively minor and have long been interpreted as consistent with a subspecific treatment. However, recent research into patterns of bioacoustic and genomic differentiation among rusty-bellied fantails from Sulawesi, Sula and Banggai has produced strong evidence in favor of species level treatment of all three island populations (
7 2
).

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="biology_ecology">
            <p>
Vocalizations
: Bioacoustically, the courtship vocalization (=song) of the new species from Peleng is the most distinct of any member of the radiation. A detailed characterization of this song has been published elsewhere (

49

). In fact, when we first found the species in the field, the bird stood out through its unusual, simple descending song that lacks the typical complex tinkling quality of its congeners (

49

). Quantitative bioacoustic comparisons revealed that the unusual vocal features of the new Peleng species have led to an acoustic leapfrog pattern in rusty-bellied fantails in which the two terminal (=easternmost and westernmost) species (i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) are more similar to each other in courtship vocalizations but are geographically divided by the new species with its unusual song (
7 2
). The great vocal distinctness of the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
is surprising because it belies its geographic proximity to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
(Sulawesi)
</tp:taxon-name>
across a combined lowland and sea gap of less than 40km and its frequent land connection to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
(Taliabu)
</tp:taxon-name>
across Pleistocene land bridges during times of global cooling (

49

). Vocal behavior is known to be an important feature in species cohesion and reproductive isolation in songbirds (
7 6, 77
), and has been shown to be more important as an indicator of species limits than plumage traits in some passerine lineages (

78

). Therefore, recent authors have accepted the unmistakable vocal uniqueness of the new Peleng fantail as an indication of its status as an undescribed new species (
57, 7 2
).

Genomic data
: In a previously published analysis (
7 2
), we conducted a comparison of&gt;11,000 genome-wide markers with a complete representation among 16 individuals spanning all three species within the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. In this analysis, the new species from Peleng emerged as most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (both subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
toradja
) and less closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sula. This phylogenomic result is significant considering that – among all pairwise vocal comparisons – the greatest bioacoustic differentiation is found between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and the new species, with strong vocal distinctions in both non-courtship vocalizations and courtship songs (
7 2
). Therefore, the relatively shallowest genomic differentiation among the three island populations corresponds to the deepest bioacoustic divergence.
</p>
            <p>
Although the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
emerged as most closely related within the radiation, comparisons of genome-wide data allow for the designation of both taxa as independent species: the basal split between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other taxa is mainly based on a genomic signal contained in ~20% of the genetic variance across study loci, whereas the second most dominant genomic signature – contained in ~14% of the genetic variance across markers – predominantly represents the deep divergence between the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
[

in (
7 2
)]. The presence of a significant proportion of genomic locus cohorts displaying deep differentiation between the new species and either of its two neighbors was in agreement with gene flow analyses (‘ABBA-BABA tests’) that pointed to a history of rare introgression between the new species and its neighbors (
7 2
), perhaps during episodes of unusual climate forcing dispersal between islands. Such secondary introgression is not unusual among congeneric bird species (

79

) and is not in conflict with species level treatment.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>
The entire crown from forehead to nape is rich earthen-brown (7.5YR 3/3) with slightly darker feather margins creating a scalloped appearance. A thin off-white supercilium is pronounced from bill base to just behind eye, from where it slowly tapers out. Lores are dark brownish-black (2.5Y 1.5/1). Ear coverts are of a medium earthen-brown tone (5YR 3/1) with fine pale shaft streaks giving a grizzled appearance, grading into a more greyish-brown tone (10YR 6/1) in the moustachial and malar region. The mantle and scapulars down to the uppertail coverts are largely concolorous with the crown but lack the scalloping created by darker feather margins. The remiges are mostly a rich cold dark-brown (2.5YR 2/1) but have warmer outer webs concolorous with mantle. The upperwing coverts are similarly two-toned, being mostly concolorous with mantle but some showing darker outer webs concolorous with most of remiges. As typical for the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
, the rectrices are narrow and dark- brown, very close in color to the remiges (2.5YR 2/1). The tail feathers are mostly worn, although one in the centre appears to be a new replacement.
</p>
            <p>The white chin and throat are quite sharply demarcated from the face. The lower throat and upper breast, still white, are interspersed with fine dusky speckling increasing towards the breast and lower throat sides where the color grades into a solid mid-grey (N5) with only few inconspicuous dusky speckles. The grey breast color then grades into a tawny- ochraceous belly color (7.5YR 4/6), first through tracts of grey feathers which have warm- ochraceous edging, then through tracts of largely ochraceous feathers that still have a grey feather centre, eventually to all-ochraceous feathers. The belly color becomes darker and richer on the undertail coverts and flanks (7.5YR 3/4).</p>
            <p>The bill is black with an inconspicuous paler tip. The gape on the live bird was slightly enlarged light yellow. The iris is dark brown. The tarsus and toes were described on the live bird as maroon-horn with paler, more yellowish toepads.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A rich dark-brown forest warbler typical of the montane resident 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. As is usual across this cryptic genus, the new taxon is most conspicuous not on the basis of its plumage but its vocalizations.
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, it is most similar in size and shape to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
of Sulawesi. However, in comparison to the new taxon, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
has less distinct speckling on the breast, has a more uniform crown that is less scalloped, paler and warmer brown upperparts, greyer underparts with brown mostly only on flanks, and has a less pointed, wider tail.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram differs in its less distinct central breast spotting, greyer (less whitish) supercilium, and more extensive grey on breast reaching further onto upper breast, neck sides and auriculars.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru differs in its much whiter breast, with off-white reaching onto mid-belly, whereas only the lower flanks and lower belly are warm-brown. Although the central breast of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
has a mid-grey tinge, its underparts are much paler than the new species’ fairly uniform grey lower breast, which grades into a fairly dark homogeneous warm-brown belly.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is quite different from the smaller 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. montis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Java. The latter is much paler cinnamon-brown on upperparts, crown and especially remiges and rectrices, and is uniformly buff-white below with extensive dark-brown speckling from chin to upper belly, lacking the new species’ grey tones on the breast and dark warm-brown tones on the belly.

The name 
<tp:taxon-name>
portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
– past participle of Latin ‘portendere’ – roughly translates as “the predicted one” or “the foretold one” and relates to the unusual circumstances of discovery when FER first heard the new warbler and recognized it to be a novel species of

multiple days before a visual confirmation was obtained.

            <p>Currently only one adult specimen is available (i.e., the holotype), and photos of up to two more adults suggest that this is probably a sexually monomorphic species with limited plumage variation.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
FER was the first person to discover 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on 9 April 2009 near its type locality when he heard an unmistakable insect-like sound that he attributed to a hitherto unnamed taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
grasshopper-warbler. Having been exposed to the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on a visit to Sulawesi only two weeks prior, and having had previous field experience with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru and Seram, respectively (
8 0
), FER was aware that the song of this population – albeit superficially reminiscent of the others – is distinct at the species level. Even so, because of the retiring nature of this bird and ill-timed heavy rain, it took FER another two hiking expeditions to the highlands of Taliabu to finally confirm on 15 April 2009 that this song was indeed uttered by what he perceived as an “unusually dark” individual of grasshopper-warbler (

48

). We encountered this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected a single specimen, now the holotype.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is presumably restricted to montane forest at the highest elevations of the island of Taliabu (

19
, 
48

) (

). All our records are from elevations above 1,050m on the more mountainous western half of the island of Taliabu, which reaches its highest altitude of ~1,415m at an unnamed peak near our collection locality (

). The new species inhabits a peculiar type of dwarf montane forest typical of these elevations.
</p>
            <p>
The occurrence of the new species on neighboring islands is highly doubtful. Of the three major islands that form the Sula archipelago, Taliabu is the largest and tallest. The smallest main island, Sanana, barely reaches above 600m elevation. The highest elevation on its larger neighbor Mangole is 1,127m – theoretically within the elevational range of this grasshopper-warbler – but the area of land above 1,050m on Mangole is only ~36 ha, which is too small an area to allow for the survival of a highly montane bird species throughout evolutionary time scales. On the neighboring Banggai archipelago, the situation is similar: the only island high enough to allow for the theoretical possibility of grasshopper-warbler breeding occurrence is Peleng (highest elevation ~1,022m), but extensive fieldwork around this highest area has not revealed the presence of any resident grasshopper-warblers (

19
, 
49

).
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
must be a rare bird: Taliabu’s area above 1,050m amounts to ~16,690 ha of formerly forested land in the interior of the island’s western half, over 97% of which forms one contiguous block (

). However, satellite imagery predominantly from 2004 indicates that a total of ~1,023 ha (~6.1%) of this area had been affected by logging operations that have degraded the forest and removed its undercover, presumably rendering the affected areas unsuitable, or nearly so, for the grasshopper-warbler. In the one-and-a-half decades since the satellite images were obtained, extensive additional logging is likely to have occurred. Another 940 ha (~5.6%) of the area above 1,050m have succumbed to a series of catastrophic forest fires in 1982 and 1983, and now constitute open grassland habitat unsuitable for this warbler (

). Our surveys showed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
does not occur in the extensive recently generated grasslands in the highlands of Taliabu (

48

). This leaves 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
with less than 15,000 ha of suitable habitat, an area likely to further diminish in size with ongoing habitat destruction and the impacts of global warming leading to an upward elevational shift of habitat zones.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We include this new taxon within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
following the phylogenetic demonstration that the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bradypterus
</tp:taxon-name>
(previously used for this Southeast Asian clade of warblers) is restricted to Africa (
8 1, 8 2
). Its inclusion within 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
is the reason why we follow the recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] of using the English moniker ‘grasshopper-warbler’ rather than the term ‘bush-warbler’, which is more appropriately reserved for members of a radiation in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Cettiidae</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
is renowned for its cryptic and conservative coloration that has confounded plumage-based classifications for decades and led to delays in the recognition of species-level taxa until bioacoustic and molecular methods have been applied (
8 3, 8 4
). In Wallacea, members of a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from Sulawesi and the Moluccas were previously united into a single polytypic species 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
(
6 1, 7 5
), but have recently been divided into three constituent island species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru, on the basis of their strikingly different songs (

57

). Our new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is geographically surrounded by constituents of this radiation and is a member of it both on the basis of morphological characters (see Diagnosis) and bioacoustic ones.
</p>
            <p>
Although plumage distinctions are not as important in the genus, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by comparatively unique, dark-brown upperparts that stand in contrast to the generally paler and warmer-brown upperparts of neighboring species. However, we mainly attribute species status to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on the basis of its unique song and genetic differentiation. We here provide an excerpt of ongoing analyses as relating to the bioacoustic and mitogenomic differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from neighboring species.

Bioacoustic evidence
: A total of 41 suitable, high-quality, homologous 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
song recordings from the field were gathered for analysis from various sources, encompassing all three previous species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation plus the new species. These recordings were measured for 11 suitable bioacoustic parameters, and resultant measurements were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and a conservative vocal diagnosability criterion (

85

), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Further details regarding all analyzed recordings, such as GPS locations, dates, times, and names of recordists, are listed in table S3, while more details on bioacoustic methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
Based on the Isler Criterion, eight out of eleven song parameters measured were diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and two other taxa: 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (table S4). Four out of eleven parameters were Isler-diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (table S4). The ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) can be adopted to ascertain if the level of vocal divergence between these archipelagic taxa is comparable in magnitude to divergences across unequivocal species-level divisions. When comparing Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler song against that of the Friendly Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
, a geographically distant species from montane Borneo that has never been included in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, only two parameters emerged as Isler-diagnosable (table S4). Using this result as a yardstick for what constitutes species level vocal differentiation, the magnitude of vocal divergence between Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
on Seram, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
on Buru, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on Sulawesi is extremely high, indicating they all have diagnosably distinct vocalizations that are best reflected in species rank.
</p>
            <p>
Principal component analysis of the vocal measurements underscores the vocal distinctness of Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from the other three Wallacean species (

). A cumulative proportion of variance of 73.3% is accounted for in the first two principal components, suggesting a strong vocal differentiation between Taliabu and the remaining taxa (

).
</p>
            <p>
Mitogenomic evidence
: Using whole-genome sequencing and laboratory approaches for the use of ancient DNA, we created an alignment of whole-mitochondrial sequences spanning ~15,000 base pairs (bp) across 11 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals belonging to all four constituent island forms of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, and used three different phylogenetic tree-building methodologies to investigate relationships and levels of divergence. More details on the methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
All three phylogenetic trees produced indicated identical topologies with high bootstrap support (

), suggesting that the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is an independent lineage most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (mitogenomic divergence ~2%), and much more distantly related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (divergence ~4.8–5%) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (divergence ~7.7–8%). Mitogenomic divergences roughly correlate with those from the COI barcoding gene, although they do not have to be equal in magnitude.
</p>
            <p>
Integrating the vocal and mitogenomic evidence, it is clear that bioacoustic differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, the two species which emerged most closely related on the mitogenomic tree (

), far exceed those between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and a geographically distant species (
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
) that has never been closely associated with the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. Our combined evidence therefore supports the treatment of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
as a well-diverged small-insular endemic species.

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic sampling:
We obtained 41 homologous recordings, which were either recorded by us in the field, or privately sourced from avid field ornithologists (including Robert O. Hutchinson and Ross Gallardy), or collected from publicly accessible online databases, namely the Avian Vocalization Center (AVoCet at http://avocet. integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu), the Xeno-Canto Sound Library (www.xeno-canto.org), the Macaulay Sound Library (www.macaulaylibrary.org), and the Internet Bird Collection (www.hbw.com/ibc).
</p>
            <p>Although slight variation in recording quality exists in the equipment used, inspection and comparison of spectrograms from different devices showed that this variation is comparable to that amongst recordings made by one sole recordist using the same device. In addition, although there is some variability in background noise, spectrogram inspection suggested that measurements of vocalizations would not be affected. Measurements of the recordings were performed using the program Raven Pro Version 1.5 (Bioacoustics Research Program, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA) on its default settings. The following eleven parameters were chosen for bioacoustic analysis, with each parameter averaged over all the measurements across one recording:</p>

Bioacoustic analysis:
The vocal diagnosability criterion outlined by Isler et al. (
8 5
), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, was used to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Besides other oscine passerines (
73, 8 6
), this criterion has been employed as a bioacoustic species delimitation method across Asian birds such as owls (

58
, 
87

), pigeons (

50
, 
52
, 
88

), and nightjars (

89

). The Isler criterion has two parts which must be fulfilled in order to infer diagnosability. Firstly, the range of measurements of a parameter between two taxa must not exhibit overlap, and secondly, the data have to satisfy the following equation: 
xa
+ 
taSDa ≤xb–tbSDb,
where (
x
) refers to the respective means of measurements in taxon a and b, and 
ti
refers to the t-score at the 95th percentile of the t distribution for 
n-1
degrees of freedom. This is a stricter statistical test than the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (
8 5
) as it employs the standard deviation of the sample points instead of the taxon mean, allowing for the diagnosis of distinctions between taxa under more rigorous conditions. Successful Isler diagnosability is defined here as the presence of at least one vocally diagnostic parameter between taxa.

DNA extraction methods:
Fresh tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
was DNA- sequenced along with the following number of toepad scrapings of historical museum specimens: three of the Buru Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, three of the Seram Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and four of the Sulawesi Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
. All museum samples had been kindly contributed by the American Museum of Natural History (for voucher numbers, see 

and table S5). DNA extraction was carried out with the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extraction of the historic museum specimens’ toepad scrapings was conducted by trained personnel (CYG) in a room dedicated to ancient DNA extraction to preclude DNA contamination. The toepads were rinsed with water four times before extraction to ensure preservatives were removed, and DTT was added to facilitate digestion of keratin present in toepads. The concentrations of the DNA extracts were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay.
</p>
            <p>
DNA sequencing methods:
The holotype’s DNA extract was sheared into smaller fragments of ~250 base pairs (bp) using 13 cycles of 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off on a Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode, USA). Whole-genome library preparation for the holotype was carried out using a NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, USA) for Illumina according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the museum toepad extracts, the shearing step was omitted as the ancient DNA is already degraded and NEBNext FFPE DNA repair mix (New England Biolabs, USA) was added to each ancient DNA sample prior to library preparation to fix damage common to degraded DNA such as deamination, nicks and gaps. In addition, size selection of library preparation products was omitted for the toepad samples to reduce DNA loss from bead selection. A total of five PCR cycles were run on the holotype’s DNA extract and 12 PCR cycles on the toepads’ extracts. Whole-genome library preparation of toepad samples was carried out in a room with a PCR hood dedicated to ancient library preparation work. The concentrations and peak fragment sizes of the libraries were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay and an Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer (Agilent, USA), respectively. The peak fragment sizes of the historic museum samples and the fresh holotype (including adaptors and unique indexes) were ~230bp and ~380bp, respectively. All prepared libraries were sent to NovogeneAIT Genomics Singapore for Illumina sequencing using a HiSeq 4000 platform to produce 150bp paired-end reads.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial genome alignment
: Trimmomatic (version 0.33) (

90

) was used to remove adaptors and filter low quality reads (below 15 Phred quality score). We applied the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (version 0.7.15-r1140) (
9 1
) to align reads to a mitochondrial reference genome, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella pryeri
</tp:taxon-name>
(Genbank accession no.: NC_029151), with a minimum mapping quality score of 30. Samtools (version 1.9) (
9 2, 9 3
) was run to convert the SAM output files from the alignment to a BAM format for downstream analysis. Then Picard (version 2.18.21; http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) was employed to insert read groups and remove PCR duplicate artifacts. The BAM files were then imported into CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0.4 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com) for remapping to the same reference genome using the following mapping parameters: mismatch penalty of 1, insertion penalty of 1, and deletion penalty of 1. The reads were locally realigned at indel regions, and the consensus sequences were extracted at a minimum coverage threshold of 100. A mapping summary produced by Qualimap (version 2.2.1) (
9 4
) indicated that our mitochondrial genome coverage ranged between ~290–2920x for museum samples and ~6430x for the holotype (table S5). Sequences are deposited with GenBank at accession numbers 
MN597052
- 
MN597062
.
</p>
            <p>
Phylogenetic analysis
: The consensus sequences were exported in FASTA format and visually realigned in MEGA7 (

95

), producing a final whole-mitochondrial alignment of ~15,000bp. MEGA7 was used to construct a neighbor-joining tree based on uncorrected p- divergences and a maximum parsimony tree. Additionally, we ran raxmlGUI 1.5 beta (

96

) to construct a maximum likelihood tree using the GTRGAMMA model as specified by jModelTest (version 2.1.7) (

97

). All tree-building analyses were conducted with 10,000 bootstrap replicates. Pairwise uncorrected p-divergences across the mitogenomic alignment were calculated in MEGA7 with 10,000 bootstrap replicates.

            <p>Head and mantle down to uppertail coverts and to central belly are bright scarlet-red (7.5R 4/14) with subtle blackish suffusion owing to individual feathers having broad red distal half followed by black and then increasingly greyish basal half; jet-black narrow orbital ring and loral line. Upperwings, sides of mantle, scapulars and rectrices are matt black, with the remiges appearing slightly duskier black because of narrow olive edging to outer webs; underwing coverts and outer webs of the underside of remiges are whitish; a blackish-grey (N1.5) wedge extends from vent up to central belly.

The diagnosis refers to the adult male plumage only. Female 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals of the Wallacean radiation are generally very similar across species, and more research is needed to identify good distinguishing marks.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is an obvious, bright scarlet-and-black representative of the Wallacean grouping of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters that have often been united within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
complex (
6 1, 7 5
), but have been considered a radiation of independent species by more recent authors [e.g. (

57

)]. Within this radiation, the new species most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species has a more extensive and brighter red body and blacker wings, scapulars, and tail. Scarlet feathers in the new species are mostly black and grey at the base, with only the distal half scarlet, and with a sharp contrast between scarlet and black, lacking 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
’s narrow yellow bands in between the red and black portions of each individual feather that render the latter’s overall body more orange-tinted. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the red is not as extensive on the underparts, and the abdomen and vent are paler buff-white versus blackish-grey in the new species.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species is paler and greyer (not black) on vent and abdomen. It also has a smudgier scarlet body coloration (caused by the black and grey basal halves of individual feathers), with dark smudges especially pronounced on face and on breast sides, as compared to more uniform red underparts, head and mantle in 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
. Black lores in the new species are wider and not as clearly delimited as in 
<tp:taxon-name>

.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis

Etymology

</p>
            <p>We name this species after the village of Wahe (1.716°S, 124.843°E), which is the gateway to the highest elevations on Taliabu where it most commonly occurs. The species epithet is an indeclinable noun in apposition.</p>

Individual, age-related and sexual variation within taxon

</p>
            <p>
Two adult male specimens (holotype and 34.356) are virtually identical in coloration. Two additional male specimens (34.373 and 34.403), most likely immatures, are similar but have the scarlet body color replaced with a more rose-red hue (5R 4/14); they also do not exhibit any distinct olive margins of remiges. No comparative specimen material exists for adult females of the new species, which are generally similar among all regional 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species. Photos confirm that the female of the new species resembles other regional species (data not shown). One juvenile specimen (34.407) lacks red coloration and is generally drab grayish-brown (paler on underparts), becoming more intense earthen-brown on the mantle, rump and upperwing coverts, with the underside of remiges and rectrices mid-grey.

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
was first spotted by a University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 led by P.J. Davidson. Participants of this exploratory survey were probably the first ornithologists to visit the highlands of Taliabu between 600-800 m elevation (
64, 9 8
), where they found the new species predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m). FER then encountered the species commonly during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu between 4-18 April 2009 (

19
, 
48

), where we returned between 6-16 December 2013 to collect the holotype and accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has thus far only been found on the island of Taliabu within the Sula Archipelago. On Taliabu, we have recorded it from sea level to 1,300m (

19
, 
48

), and it presumably occurs further up all the way to the highest elevation at ~1,415m. The species inhabits forest canopy and edge habitat, and is a nectarivore and frugivore that has been photographed feeding at flowers (

48

). Akin to multiple other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species in Wallacea (

57

), the new species is seen far more often at higher elevations (roughly above ~800m) than in the lowlands. Davidson et al. (

64

), who first sighted this species, exclusively found it at higher elevations, mostly around ~800m, and we recorded it as “abundant” above 800m, whereas we have only had a handful of sightings in the lowlands. It is unknown to what extent elevational differences in abundance reflect the difficulty of detecting a canopy bird in tall lowland forest as compared to stunted montane forest. However, although detection difficulties may help mask its true abundance in the lowlands, we do not believe it is possible for the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
to be equally common across elevations given that other small canopy birds do not escape detection in the lowlands and are recorded commonly. In fact, the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
may even be a breeding endemic to montane elevations and only venture into the lowlands seasonally, following tree flowering and fruiting events. This potential seasonal displacement would explain why some expeditions have completely overlooked it in the lowlands while others have recorded it on occasion.
</p>
            <p>
It is contentious whether the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
is endemic to Taliabu, or also occurs on the other two main islands of the Sula Archipelago (Mangole and Sanana). The latter two have received even less ornithological attention than Taliabu, and to the best of our knowledge, the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has never been recorded there on recent ornithological expeditions (D. Yong, pers. comm.; J.A. Eaton, pers. comm.). Sanana is relatively low-lying (up to ~600m) and therefore likely to lack a number of Taliabu’s montane species. Mangole reaches its highest peak at 1,127m, but areas above 800m are confined to ~328 ha only, which gives it a comparatively small area of true montane forest. The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
’s level of dependence on vegetation at high elevations probably determines whether it would be capable of occurring on Mangole or even Sanana. Future fieldwork on those two islands will shed light on whether the new species occurs there or not.
</p>
            <p>
FER and Filip Verbelen first discovered a new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
population in the mountains of Peleng in the neighboring Banggai Archipelago during a visit between 23-30 March 2009 and recorded it as reasonably common at elevations between 700-900m in the western Peleng highlands (

49

). On our collecting expedition, we only had one aural encounter of this 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
on Peleng on 21 Dec 2013, indicating that the population might have been seasonally displaced or more retiring (

19

). However, photographic evidence from the 2009 visit indicates that the Peleng population has a plumage coloration that is very similar – if not identical – to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and quite different from 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
. As this Peleng population remains uncollected, future fieldwork will hopefully produce specimens allowing a determination whether there are differences between the Peleng birds and 
<tp:taxon-name>

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu is obviously a member of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, which used to be considered a single wide-ranging polytypic species for a long time (
6 1, 7 5
), but has now been divided into multiple monotypic island endemics by most recent authors on the basis of extensive plumage differences [e.g. (
57, 8 0, 99
)]. Within this radiation, its plumage most closely resembles that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, but is discrete from both of them in multiple characters (see Diagnosis). Its morphological differences from both 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
exceed those between other closely related species pairs within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. dammermani
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
(

73

). Therefore, its diagnosis here as a species level taxon rests on Mayr and Ashlock’s (

70

) yardstick approach, by which species status is conferred on the basis of divergences that exceed those of species pairs in which biologically important differences have been unequivocally demonstrated.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters have a wide vocal repertoire that is oftentimes problematic in the context of bioacoustic analysis (

73

). The Taliabu 
<tp:taxon-name>Myzomela</tp:taxon-name>
was hardly vocal during our encounters, and we do not consider vocalizations a fruitful taxonomic avenue in delimiting this new species from others. Instead, we have generated mitochondrial sequence data to further shed light on the new species’ taxonomic status.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial evidence
: Our mitochondrial tree analysis was based on sequences of the coding gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), comparing 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
to a great majority of members of the eastern and central Indonesian radiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters. Results indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
is most closely related to geographically adjacent species such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (

). Our analysis does not provide resolution on whether either 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
constitute the sister species to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
, and in fact, the latter two may well be sister to each other instead (

), rendering 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
a more basal species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from adjacent Buru is not represented in our mitochondrial dataset, and likely forms part of this group. Based on plumage coloration, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
is frequently considered to constitute the sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, and the two are sometimes merged under one species [e.g. (

99

)]. Therefore, we assume that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
– albeit closely related – will probably not emerge as the direct sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
in future analyses.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial ND2 divergence values between 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
and its two most closely related relatives (

<tp:taxon-name>M. elisabethae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chloroptera</tp:taxon-name>

) range between 3.5%–4.3% (

), well above the mitochondrial divergence threshold of 2-3% widely postulated in the literature (
10 0, 10 1
), providing additional support for species level recognition of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial analysis:
We extracted DNA from the breast muscle tissue of all our 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
material (n = 5), and from four independently collected 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
samples (

73

), using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. ND2 was then sequenced following Lim et al. (
10 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Using CodonCode Aligner version 8.0.2. (CodonCode, USA), our ND2 sequences were trimmed and assembled. These sequences of 991 bp length were then aligned in MEGA7 (
9 5
) with the ND2 sequences of 23 other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>The crown (from forehead to nape) is cold brown (2.5Y 2/2), delimited below by a narrow long white supercilium from bill base to napeside. Lores dark greyish brown (2.5Y 3/1) extending to just behind eye in the form of an eyestripe cutting through a broken white eye ring formed by small feathers peripheral to the eye. Black rictal bristles. Ear coverts and malar, facial and moustachial regions show white-and-dusky grizzling. Most of upperparts, including mantle, scapulars and rump, are mid-olive (5Y 4/4), while remiges are distinctly darker-olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). The white chin and throat are characterized by sporadic dusky speckles and lemon streaks increasing towards the lower throat, and grading into a fully lemon to sulphur yellow breast and belly (5Y 9/12). The yellow on the breast and belly has an olive-mottled appearance because of olive feather tips (5Y 4/4), especially pronounced towards the flanks, and white feather bases, especially pronounced towards the abdomen. The vent is solid lemon-yellow (5Y8/7). Iris dark-brown; bill black. Tarsus, toes and claws pinkish-grey with toepads paler yellowish.</p>

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The new species name is derived from “suara merdu” in Bahasa Indonesia, translating as “melodious voice”, referring to the pleasing vocalizations of this bird that FER heard hours before the first individual was seen, allowing for predictions prior to visual confirmation that this would be a new

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
During a visit to the highlands of Peleng between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently encountered this species at elevations between 700-900m (

49

). When hiking up to these elevations for the first time and hearing the melodious warble of this taxon in the distance, its superficial vocal resemblance to other members of the Wallacean 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation prompted FER to predict that this would be a new leaf-warbler taxon long before they laid their eyes on it. Once they first saw it, it was noticeable for its unusual behavior of frequently climbing along larger branches and trunks of trees in the manner of a treecreeper (
<tp:taxon-name>
Certhia
</tp:taxon-name>
). On our collecting expedition to Peleng between 18-23 Dec 2013, the species was less commonly encountered (

19

), probably because of seasonality.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new leaf-warbler is restricted to the highland forests of western Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago at elevations above 700m, reaching the highest island altitude above 1000m (

). Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago must be in serious doubt because only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, of which only 5 ha of land lie above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. Beyond the Banggai Archipelago,

Lemon ear coverts down to malar and moustachial regions (5Y 9/10) grizzled with dusky-olive feather edging, making for a mottled facial appearance. Upperparts from mantle and scapulars to rump are mid-olive (7.5Y 4/6). Remiges are distinctly darker- olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). Underparts from chin to vent are largely lemon to sulphur yellow, with white feather bases creating a more lemon-yellow hue on throat, breast and belly (7.5Y 8/8) and olive feather tips (5Y 4/4) generating a more olive- mottled appearance on flanks, while the undertail coverts are largely uniform lemon (5Y 9/12).</p>

<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
A University of East Anglia expedition by Davidson et al. (

64

) was the first to find a resident population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers on Taliabu, which they encountered commonly in montane forest and which they considered to represent an undescribed taxon. Rheindt (

48

) then studied this leaf warbler during his visit between 4-18 April 2009, and we found them again during our expedition between 6-16 Dec 2 013 and collected two (

19

).

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>
Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new warbler inhabits disturbed and undisturbed montane forest on Taliabu from 700m up to probably the highest elevations above 1,400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). It may also occur on the large neighboring island of Mangole, which rises to 1,127m and should harbor enough area of montane forest habitat above 700m to sustain a population. However, a lack of fieldwork in the mountains of Mangole means that there is no information available on its montane avifauna. The smallest main constituent of the Sula Archipelago, the densely populated island of Sanana, is unlikely to sustain any 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers as it barely reaches above 600m, which seems to be too low for this species. The species is replaced on the Banggai Archipelago by the newly described 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
(see SM5), while 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
replace it in various parts of Sulawesi. Given its more relaxed elevational requirements and its tolerance for disturbed habitat, this species is probably not as immediately endangered as some of the other montane Taliabu avifauna.

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
)


</p>
            <p>
The leaf-warbler genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
constitutes a large Old World radiation of small passerines that is exceptionally well-studied in phylogenetic terms (
10 6-1 09
). Recent demonstrations of genus paraphyly in combination with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
[summarized in (
10 8
)] have prompted a variety of new generic treatments, including a division into two re-defined genera [
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
; see (

57

)], but we here follow the latest phylogenetic treatise that suggests a merger of all 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
into a single genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
10 8
).
</p>
            <p>
Despite the genus’s well-known evolutionary history, a sizeable sub-clade of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Australasian (including Indonesian) Archipelago has largely been omitted from modern molecular insights. Notable exceptions include the first-ever example of a new avian species description (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. rotiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) partly based on genome-wide DNA data from the Timor region (
11 0
). However, most island populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
in this region have been merged into a limited number of ‘wastebasket species’, e.g. Mountain Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trivirgatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and Island Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
, although vocal and plumage differences among them often far exceed those documented among the better- studied continental groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
8 0
). As a consequence, some modern treatments [e.g. (

57

)] have adopted a ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) in which pairwise plumage and vocal differences between archipelagic taxa that are comparable in magnitude to those between better-studied continental species pairs (or exceed them) are interpreted as being indicative of species status. In this way, a number of highly distinct island taxa have been elevated to species level, such as Buru Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. everetti
, Seram Leaf Warbler
</tp:taxon-name>
               <tp:taxon-name>
P. ceramensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[a treatment that had previously been suggested on the basis of vocal and plumage comparisons; see (

80

)], and a number of additional Wallacean taxa. Our description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
follows this framework of affording species rank to taxa when vocal and plumage characters indicate deeper divisions. We also bring genome-wide DNA data to bear on the taxonomic classification of these two new species. However, following the yardstick approach as applied under the Biological Species Concept, we believe that biological characters, especially bioacoustic ones, will be the most important indicators when conferring species status in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers.
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: As for plumage characters, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
differ from each other and from surrounding taxa in a number of important traits (see Diagnosis for each taxon) which are far more salient than the plumage differences of often identical-looking species pairs on the Asian continent that are otherwise vocally and phylogenetically deeply diverged [e.g. the three members of the Arctic Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. borealis
</tp:taxon-name>
trio; (
11 1
)]. Most importantly, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
has a contrastingly white throat and supercilium and a grey-and-white grizzled auricular patch where all other surrounding taxa are much more yellowish, rendering it instantly recognizable in large series of specimens. In contrast, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is superficially reminiscent of Sulawesi Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
in its overall more yellowish coloration, displaying a phenotypic leapfrog pattern that has been documented from the Taliabu-Peleng-Sulawesi island trio on multiple previous occasions (
50, 7 2
). However, this superficial resemblance notwithstanding, it has important distinctions in bare-parts coloration and overall pigmentation (see Diagnosis), apart from obvious vocal differences.

Bioacoustic evidence
: In bioacoustic terms, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by melodious jumbles of 1–1.5sec, mostly at 2000–6000 Hz, with short individual high notes between 5000–7000 Hz occasionally interspersed. Song motifs generally lack repetitive element sequences or trills (

). In contrast, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by 1.5–3sec strophes mostly between 2000–6500 Hz (typically of a wider frequency range than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
) that constitute a melodious jumble often followed by a final repetitive phrase, which can sometimes be omitted (

). In this respect, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is slightly more reminiscent of the East Sulawesi population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng (despite the geographic proximity of the latter two). The 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
population on Gunung Tumpu (East Sulawesi) is often characterized by strong repetitive series at a very broad frequency range (2500–7000 Hz), mostly preceded by a variable but simple melodious series of elements between 2000–5000 Hz and a brief nasal note separating this variable series from the repetitive series (

). Depending on the presence or absence of components, the song rendition (=motif) can be 1.5–4sec long. In summary, the songs of these three forms (

<tp:taxon-name>P. suaramerdu</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. emilsalimi</tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
), while highly variable, are predictably different and strongly indicative of species status when put into the context of song differences among other 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
species (

).

Genomic evidence
: We generated a set of ~4,100 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment spanning almost 3 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial cytochrome- 
b
(cyt- 
b
) sequences, to shed light on the differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in separate Methods paragraphs below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three taxa (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
from East Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population-genomic space based on ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (

). The main division according to genomic PCA occurred between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
versus the other two taxa (PC1 in 

). The same relationship was strongly reflected in maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of concatenated genome-wide sequence alignments of almost 3 million base pairs length as well as in maximum-parsimony (MP) analysis of a concatenated set of ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (topology 1 in 

). In contrast, mitochondrial cyt- 
b
gene analysis and species-tree inference of genome-wide SNPs recovered a topology in which 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
were strongly supported sister lineages, with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
being more basal (topology 2 in 

). Depths of uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence (as determined by cyt- 
b
distances) were comparatively low across all three leaf-warblers (0.7-1.6%; 

).
</p>
            <p>
In summary, our phylogenomic analyses demonstrated considerable incongruence among tree topologies, including a strong mito-nuclear discordance that calls into doubt the reliability of mitochondrial divergence values in this dataset. For instance, the deepest genomic divergence was detected between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other two species (PC1 in 

), whereas on mitochondrial cyt- 
b
evidence 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
displayed some of the most shallow divergences from the other taxa (

). The use of mitochondrial divergences in species delimitation suffers from multiple confounding biases (
79, 10 0, 10 1
), especially when dealing with complexes containing closely-allied allopatric taxa that have a propensity for secondary gene flow (
11 2-11 4
). The best explanatory hypothesis for the pronounced mito- nuclear discordance in this dataset is that occasional overwater dispersal followed by hybridization and gene flow may have led to the introgression of foreign alleles in one or the other species, obfuscating clean branching patterns. Gene flow during sporadic hybridization is known to artifactually reduce mitochondrial divergences, masking deeper levels of genomic differentiation (

79

). Hence, introgression can account for the presence of relatively low mitochondrial divergences in a group of species characterized by comparatively deep genomic divergences and pronounced levels of bioacoustic differentiation [(

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted DNA from the fresh muscle tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and the three specimens collected by us (including the holotype) of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
, along with one individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
that we had collected on Mt Tumpu on the eastern peninsula of Sulawesi (

19

). Additional tissue samples were obtained from the American Museum of Natural History, New York (AMNH): three samples of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
from South Sulawesi and an outgroup sample of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus pallescens
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Solomon Islands. The AMNH samples were only used for phylogenomic rooting. DNA extraction was performed using the Exgene Clinic SV kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul) following the manufacturer’s instructions. We eluted the DNA in two consecutive rounds of 100μl molecular grade water. We prepared double-digest restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing (ddRADSeq) libraries using the same protocol as Garg et al. (
11 5
) with EcoRI and MspI as restriction enzymes. We quantified DNA and library product concentrations using the Qubit 2.0 Broad Range DNA Assay (Invitrogen, California), and used a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Iowa) to perform final quality checks on the library product. The genomic libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform at the Singapore Center for Environmental Life Science Engineering. Filtering and demultiplexing of the genomic data in STACKS 1.34 followed the same general procedures as detailed by Ng et al. (
7 2
), and are the result of comprehensive trials using a wide variety of different parameters and settings at each step of the analysis. DNA data is deposited with Genbank at BioProject accession number PRJNA566263.
</p>
            <p>
SNP calling and genomic supermatrix generation:
Reference genome alignment was performed using BWA 0.7.12 (
9 1
) and samtools 0.1.19 (http://samtools.sourceforge.net) (
9 2, 9 3
) on the Greenish Warbler (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
) genome (
11 6
), the most closely related available full genome. We performed SNP calling in STACKS 1.34 as per Ng et al. (
7 2
). We required loci to be present across all individuals, and retained one random SNP per locus to exclude obviously linked SNP loci. Subsequently, we used PLINK 1.9 (
11 7
) and Bayescan 2.1 (
11 8
) to filter SNPs for linkage disequilibrium and signs of selection. Data format manipulation and conversions were performed with PGDSpider (
1 19
). The final filtered dataset totaled 4,104 SNPs. In addition, we created concatenated SNP datasets for each group for use in downstream maximum parsimony analysis.
</p>
            <p>
Following the procedures used by Ng et al. (
7 2
), we generated a concatenated read supermatrix without missing data using pyRAD (
12 0
). We stipulated a minimum required locus coverage of 20, and kept the clustering threshold within and between reads at the default of 0.88. The final concatenated read supermatrix amounted to 2,861,661 bp in length, generated from 19,985 loci.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial sequence generation:
We sequenced cyt- 
b
using the primers H16065 (
12 1
) and L14995 (
12 2
), with 40 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 72°C. We conducted PCR product cleanup with ExoSAP-IT 
®
and used the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) for cycle- sequencing. Sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer using capillary electrophoresis. We assembled cyt- 
b
sequences with CodonCode Aligner 4.1 and aligned them with ClustalW (
12 3
). The final cyt- 
b
alignment was 1,100bp long, indel- free and fully translatable. Mitochondrial sequences have been deposited with Genbank at accession numbers 
MN518858
- 
MN518862
.
</p>
            <p>
Population structure inference:
In order to test for the presence of geographic structuring across East Sulawesi, Peleng, and Taliabu, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the genomic SNP data. PCA was performed using ade4 (
12 4
) and factoextra (
12 5
), both available as R packages (
12 6
).
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial tree inference:
We constructed phylogenetic cyt- 
b
trees using two methods: maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML). We ran MP analyses using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
), performing 10,000 bootstrap replicates. For ML analyses, we first used jModelTest v2.1.6 (

97

) and determined that the Jukes-Cantor model (
12 8
) was the best performing substitution model. We then ran RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) using the extensive subtree-pruning-regrafting tree search algorithm.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic tree inference:
We applied three different genomic tree inference analyses: coalescent-based species tree inference (applied to the SNP dataset), maximum likelihood tree inference (applied to concatenated read supermatrix), and maximum parsimony tree inference (applied to the concatenated SNP dataset). We performed species tree inference using SNAPP (
1 29
) as implemented in BEAST 2.3.0, performing two iterations using default settings. Tracer 1.6 was used after each iteration to ensure that the runs had reached convergence, after which LogCombiner v2.3.0 and DensiTree (
13 0
) were used to process results. We carried out ML tree inference using RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) on the concatenated read supermatrix using the general-time-reversible gamma-invariant (GTRGAMMA) model and performed 1,000 rapid bootstrap searches. Finally, we conducted conventional MP analysis on the concatenated SNPs of each taxon set, using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
) and running 10,000 bootstrap replicates to evaluate branch support.

Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts are bronzy olive (2.5Y 3/4), the remiges and rectrices slightly darker and with more coppery edging (10YR 4/6). Dull white on breast reaches to chin, with an orange-rufescent tinge (7.5YR 7/6) surrounding the breast laterally and ventrally. Yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, with a rufescent-orange suffusion to flanks (7.5YR 7/6). Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Dark-horn mandible. Yellow-orange tarsus on live bird.

One of the phenotypically most distinct subspecies of the Mountain Tailorbird or Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Uniquely among all subspecies, the new taxon has a rufescent suffusion on throat and breast, becoming especially pronounced on breast sides and auriculars (from where it grades into the rufous crown), rendering the bird’s anterior aspect much warmer-tinged than all other subspecies. The upperparts, especially upper wings, are also warmer bronzy and the flanks tinged more rufescent than all other subspecies, making this the most reddish-looking taxon in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. It additionally differs from most other subspecies (except those from Sulawesi and Peleng) in the rufous crown’s more posterior extension to the nape and in the absence of a pale supercilium.
</p>
            <p>
It further differs from

(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis

malayanus

riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow on belly and lower breast (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near- complete absence of yellow, respectively). For additional differences from the new subspecies on Peleng, see SM8.

Davidson et al. (

<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoiler (then called an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird) for Taliabu, and characterized the population as inhabiting montane forest above 500m and possibly in need of taxonomic description. FER found this population commonly in disturbed montane forest to over 1,100 m, with a few records in dense secondary bamboo thickets down to 50m (

48

), and our collecting expedition re-encountered this form abundantly at elevations around 1,300m (

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, this new subspecies is currently only known from Taliabu in the Sula Archipelago. There, it inhabits disturbed situations (forest edge, bamboo thickets) mostly in the mountains, with the highest record at 1300m, but presumably ranging to the highest point at over 1400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). On other islands, mountain leaftoilers rarely range lower than ~500m (

57

), but Rheindt (

48

) exceptionally recorded the new taxon on Taliabu from an extensive bamboo thicket at ~50m, demonstrating that this population may tolerate lower elevations. The presence of this leaftoiler on the other two main Sula islands, Mangole and Sanana, is likely, especially on the former, which rises to over 1,100m, but perhaps also on the latter, which reaches to a little over 600m. However, it has probably been overlooked owing to a lack of fieldwork at higher elevations on these two islands. On the Banggai Archipelago, the species is represented by another novel subspecies (see below) that replaces 
sulanus
there. Its predilection for disturbed forest situations and wide elevational tolerance as compared to other insular mountain birds probably means that it is currently not of conservation concern.

Crown and nape rich rufous (2.5YR 4/10), slightly darker posteriorly, and not extending as far onto the nape as in the new Taliabu subspecies (
P. c. sulanus
; see SM7). Short blackish eyestripe. Facial region from auriculars to lores dusky-grey (N3) with an increasing rufous suffusion (concolorous with crown) towards the malar and moustachial regions. Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts olive with a slight bronzy hue (5Y 3/4), colder-colored than in the new subspecies from Taliabu (
P. c. sulanus
). Remiges and rectrices are darker and duskier, but with outer edging nearly concolorous with mantle. Underparts are bicolored, with a white chin to breast, and a lemon-yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, and with a dusky olive suffusion on the flanks. Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Tarsus dark-yellow. On the live bird, the upper mandible was black with a yellow tip, and the lower mandible was black with a yellow base and tip. The iris color was not clearly discerned on the live bird.

            <p>
A distinct new subspecies of Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(or ‘Mountain Tailorbird’), differing from adjacent subspecies to the east and to the west in important discrete characters.
</p>
            <p>
The lack of a supercilium and the posterior extension of the rufous crown coloration onto the mid-nape set this subspecies apart from most other subspecies, except those from Sulawesi and Taliabu, which have an equally or sometimes even slightly more extensive rufous crown. It further differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis
(Borneo), 
malayanus
(Malay Peninsula) and all subspecies further west and north in the absence of a strong grey hindcollar band and/or strongly grey breast sides; from 
<tp:taxon-name>
batjanensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(Bacan Island) in its lemon-yellow belly lacking a strong olive suffusion; and from 
dumasi
(Seram and Buru) in its much less brown-colored upperparts. In many aspects, the new taxon is similar to the set of subspecies on Sulawesi (
riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow belly (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near-complete absence of yellow, respectively).
</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies shares many unique traits with the new subspecies from Taliabu 
sulanus
(see SM7), but differs significantly in its darker chestnut crown and its less reddish overall appearance, largely lacking a rufescent suffusion to the breast and flanks, and showing much less rufescent on the auriculars; its flanks are also much colder olive-washed (versus warmly rufescent-washed), and the upperparts and especially upper wings are colder bronze-olive. On live birds, the legs are much darker and less intensely colorful than those of birds from Taliabu.

FER and Filip Verbelen first encountered and documented the new subspecies during a visit to the highlands of western Peleng between 22-31 March 2009 (

Typical of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers, this new taxon is restricted to forest edge situations, treefall gaps and bamboo thickets in montane forest on the island of Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago. During our combined visits to the island (

19
, 
49

), we recorded this new taxon from 750m to the highest point at over 1000m elevation. It may, therefore, not range as low as the new taxon from neighboring Taliabu, although future fieldwork may well produce lower elevational records. Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago is unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new subspecies. Despite its very small range, its predilection for disturbed forest situations probably means that it is not particularly negatively affected by the current degradation that is impacting most highland forests of western Peleng.

Taxonomic rationale (combined for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus sulanus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
P. c. relictus
)


</p>
            <p>
The Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
was previously thought to be an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird and then called Mountain Tailorbird. We here acknowledge the distant relationship to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbirds (
13 1
) and therefore follow the recent trend of calling members of this species ‘leaftoilers’ rather than tailorbirds [e.g. (

57

)], a fitting translation from their re- instated scientific genus name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
. As for the species name 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, we follow the recently proposed emendation (

6

) of the original spelling of the name (‘ 
cuculatus’
) on the basis of information in the original description showing that the name was meant to refer to the birds’ hooded appearance (from Latin cucullus – hood).
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: The new subspecies 
sulanus
from Taliabu is arguably one of the most distinctly-colored, if not the single most distinctly-colored subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(see Diagnosis) and is therefore well-deserving of subspecies status. Its reddish-suffused anterior body renders it instantly recognizable among any series of specimens. Although not as unique in morphology, we also describe 
relictus
from Peleng at the subspecific level mainly on the basis of its distinct coloration. In plumage distinctness, 
relictus
far exceeds several other previously recognized subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, such as 
P. c. cinereicollis
.
</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic evidence
: We have been unsuccessful in procuring a sufficiently large sample set of song recordings of the two new subspecies, precluding rigorous bioacoustic analysis. However, we note that the songs given by these two subspecies in the field did not strike us as very different from the songs of other subspecies we are familiar with. Song playback with recordings from several other islands elicited a ready response at least in 
P. c. relictus
. Based on our bioacoustic experience with Indonesian passerines, we do not have the impression that song differences of the two new subspecies would warrant anything but a subspecific treatment at the present time.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic evidence
: We created a set of ~8,500 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment of over 2 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase intron 2 (ND2) sequences, to investigate levels of differentiation among 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in a separate Methods paragraph below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three subspecies (
P. c. stentor
from eastern Sulawesi, 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng and 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population- genomic space (

). The main genomic division according to a PCA based on ~8,500 SNPs occurred between 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu versus the other two subspecies (PC1 in 

). In contrast to the leaf-warbler analysis (see SM6), this main genomic division among leaftoilers was also supported by the mitochondrial tree and the genomic ‘species tree’ (

), consistently placing 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng close to 
P. c. stentor
from Sulawesi, although the concatenated tree built from genome-wide loci was in conflict, placing 
P. c. relictus
closer to 
P. c. sulanus
. Coincidentally, the majority tree with a basal placement of 
sulanus
(topology 1 in 

) is also the arrangement that would be supported by the extraordinarily divergent plumage of 
sulanus
, making it unique among all leaftoiler subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
Pairwise divergences between the subspecies (as determined by ND2 distances) were relatively low (0.3-1.7%; 

), at levels generally accepted to be below the species threshold for birds [(~2-3%; (
100, 10 1
)], consistent with the current proposed subspecies status. These ND2 divergences further supported the majority tree (topology 1 in 

) by consistently rendering 
P. c. sulanus
as the most deeply diverged subspecies (up to ~1.7%), whereas 
P. c. relictus
and 
P. c. stentor
emerged as only 0.3% diverged.
</p>
            <p>
In summary, mitochondrial sequence analysis, PCA of genome-wide SNPs and ‘species-tree’ analysis all agree in placing 
P. c. sulanus
basal to the other two subspecies, an arrangement supported by its distinct plumage. Therefore, we have no reason to suspect bias in the mitochondrial divergence depth (unlike in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
, see SM6), which supports our bioacoustic assessment that both 
relictus
and 
sulanus
are at the subspecies level. Future studies of the uniquely colored 
P. c. sulanus
may yet challenge this assessment.
</p>
            <p>
Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted genomic DNA of all tissue material available for 
P. c. sulanus
(n=5) and 
P. c. relictus
(n=2), along with two samples of 
P. c. stentor
that we had independently collected on Mt Tumpu on the adjacent eastern Sulawesi peninsula (

19

). Tissue of a single individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cettia parens
</tp:taxon-name>
from Makira in the Solomon Islands, provided by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was also extracted to serve as an outgroup in phylogenomic rooting. Laboratory and analytical protocols followed our procedures outlined in SM6 (under 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
), utilizing the same reference genome (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
), but using a minimum stack depth of 5 in STACKS 1.34 and a minimum required locus coverage of 5 in pyRAD due to differences in sequencing quality. The final filtered dataset for the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers totaled 8,515 SNPs and the final concatenated read supermatrix was 2,002,726 bp long, generated from 13,194 separate loci. For mitochondrial analysis, we sequenced ND2 using the primers L5219Met and H6313Trp (
13 2
) with 35 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 50-53°C, but otherwise following the procedures as outlined in SM6. The final ND2 alignment for the leaftoilers was 1,015bp long, indel-free and fully translatable. All DNA data has been deposited with Genbank at accession number PRJNA566263 and 
MN518850

Hartert, 1920 (‘extremely neglected’) from Selayar Island, were based on the impression that the description of these birds had escaped the attention of researchers for too long. The presently described taxon, only discovered in the 21

century, fulfils that criterion even more adequately, so we take pleasure in naming it 
omississimus
(‘the most neglected’), superlative of ‘omissus’.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The immature plumage remains undocumented. The only two male specimens known to exist (holotype and MZB.Ornit.34.488) show minimal plumage variation, the only difference perhaps being the latter specimen’s slightly brighter, more brilliant rump and darker, more blackish tarsus and claws in life.</p>
            <p>As compared to males, the three female specimens have a duller blue supercilium (but still discernible), lack a black chin, have prominent rufous spectacles over a narrow blackish stripe through the cere, the rufous continuing to the lower sides of the face where it is finely speckled dark (in two of three females the speckling continues to the throat sides), and have much less dark blackish-blue auriculars, contrasting less with the rufous throat. The female’s upperparts are less brilliant blue. One of the three female specimens is slightly paler on the tarsus and claws.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new subspecies was first reported by Indrawan et al. (
13 3
), who documented the sighting of a female on 15 May 2001 and a male on 29 July 2001 at 50-100m elevation around Benteng on the main island of Togian, and pointed out that this new population may be an undescribed subspecies. Following their footsteps, Filip Verbelen (pers. comm.) made the first sound recordings of the new population in December 2008 when studying a few individuals on Kadidiri, a tiny forested tourist resort island off the coast of Togian measuring ~4km in length and less than 1km in width. A few days later, F. Verbelen moved to Batudaka, one of the three main islands of the archipelago, where he found additional individuals in coastal forest near the capital town of Wakai. FER visited Batudaka Island from 23-27 April 2009 and observed this new population. On our collecting trip, we visited Batudaka from 24-28 Dec 2013 and found this taxon to be common in the forests outside the capital town of Wakai, collecting the present material in the process (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>The new subspecies is known from the Togian Archipelago in the Gulf of Tomini, a satellite group of islands between the northern and eastern peninsulas of Sulawesi. More specifically, to the best of our knowledge the new subspecies has so far been found on the two main islands of Togian and Batudaka, as well as on the tiny islet of Kadidiri off Togian, where it is common in remnant forest and edge from near sea level to at least ~200m elevation. However, it is likely that the birds occur up to the highest elevations at ~430m on these islands. More field research is required to map this subspecies’ occurrence on other islands in this archipelago. Its presence on some of the larger, forest-covered islands in close proximity to Batudaka and Togian, such as Talatakoh, Waleakodi and Waleabahi, is virtually guaranteed, given its occurrence on tiny Kadidiri. However, its presence on slightly more distant islands, such as Puah (at ~18km from the main archipelago) and Unauna (at ~28km from the main archipelago) is less certain, although these latter islands are connected to the main archipelago by shallow sea-beds not exceeding 120m depth, indicating that they would have been connected with one another during glacial sea level recessions.</p>
            <p>
On the main island of Sulawesi, the newly described 
omississimus
is replaced by the nominate taxon 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Unusually, however, the nominate form on Sulawesi is a hill and montane forest denizen, occurring from 500-2300m elevation and shunning lowland forest habitats in stark contrast to the new subspecies.
</p>
            <p>The new subspecies appears to be moderately tolerant to habitat disturbance where small-scale timber extraction leads to a secondarization of primary forest. However, the taxon disappears where forest is converted into agricultural land. Although Togian’s forests are quickly dwindling, with most remnants by now secondary and restricted to inland locations away from the coast, far more than half of the islands should still be suitable for the new taxon, making it safe for the time being.</p>

            <p>
Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The proposed English name of this new taxon follows a recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] to call members of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
‘jungle-flycatchers’ rather than ‘blue-flycatchers’ because molecular data (
13 4
) and bioacoustic considerations (
57, 7 4
) strongly suggest a merger of many members of the previously recognized jungle-flycatcher genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinomyias
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Given that numerous species in the resultant genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
are no longer blue but entirely brown, the name ‘blue-flycatcher’, while formerly appropriate, is no longer suitable for this genus.
</p>
            <p>
Although distinguishable from other subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
in terms of plumage characters (see Diagnosis), 
omississimus
is quite similar to them in general coloration. At any rate, plumage coloration is not an ideal taxonomic indicator in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
jungle-flycatchers, many of which boast a highly conserved male plumage sporting blue upperparts and reddish underparts. Other characters, such as bioacoustic and genetic ones, may be more conducive to guiding taxonomic decision-making in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
We recently published a bioacoustic comparison on the basis of six vocal parameters among members of the greater 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, showing that the song of the newly described 
omississimus
from Togian exhibits considerable vocal overlap with the songs of all three analyzed subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
, while distinctly differing from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. kalaoensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[see 

in (
7 4
)]. This vocal evidence along with Togian’s proximity to Sulawesi suggest a placement of 
omississimus
as a subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Based on a lack of deep differentiation in both bioacoustic and genetic evidence, we propose to classify this new taxon at the subspecies level. Upon first discovery in the field, we were generally impressed by its lowland forest occurrence, which stands in contrast to the montane forest requirements of the nominate subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi. This pronounced difference in habitat preference was given much weight in supporting species- level recognition of the new Togian population in a recently published field guide to the region (

57

). However, given Gwee et al.’s (
7 4
) newly published data, the latter treatment has ultimately proved erroneous.

in its lack of solid white or rufous on the belly; its uniform dark-brown coloration in which only the underparts show a faint warm tinge; and its unmarked dark-brown vent. The new subspecies has a darker hood and breast than the above-mentioned taxa except for the intensely rufous-bellied 
fumidus
and perhaps 
hygroscopus
. It also differs from 
deningeri
from Seram in its paler, browner (less black) body color, with a darker non-contrasting hood, and differs from 
schlegelii
and 
sterlingi
(both from Timor) in its less olive overall coloration and lack of rufous belly and vent.
</p>
            <p>
Within Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely resembles the much larger and longer-winged 
versteegi
and 
papuensis
from Papua but is dark slaty-brown (versus black) in overall body color and has an unmarked vent. The lower underparts have more extensive and paler-cinnamon feather margins in the new subspecies versus narrower, more rufous feather margins in the Papuan forms.
</p>
            <p>
Among geographically more distant Island Thrush subspecies from outside of Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely approaches three taxa from the Solomon Islands (
bougainvillei, kulambangrae, sladeni)
and two taxa from the Bismarck Archipelago (
heinrothi, beehleri
), but lacks those subspecies’ blackish overall body color. It also superficially resembles 
nigrorum
from Negros (Philippines), but the latter subspecies’ lower belly grades into whitish on the vent while the new subspecies is uniformly dark on those parts. Furthermore, another Philippine subspecies, 
kelleri
from Mt Apo (Mindanao), is similar to the new subspecies but becomes darker brown towards the front of the head while the new subspecies has a nearly uniform head coloration becoming slightly paler on the forehead.

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The subspecies name, translated from Bahasa Indonesia “it likes the rain” (=suka hujan), refers to the circumstances surrounding the bird’s discovery. On FER’s first expedition to the highest parts of Taliabu (

48

), heavy persistent rain impeded bird observations, leading to a decision to abort the expedition ahead of schedule. On his premature descent, FER then spotted a hardy individual of the new thrush, perched in the pouring rain, leading him to change plans yet again and mount a subsequent second and eventually third expedition to these elevations in better weather. This latter third expedition then allowed for a more detailed documentation of Taliabu’s distinct novel montane avifauna (

19
, 
48

). The name 
sukahujan
is treated as an inalienable noun in apposition.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>All nine specimens procured resemble one another considerably in coloration. The greatest variation occurs in the tone of the lower breast and abdomen, which is intermediate in the holotype but ranges from all-drab brownish grey throughout with almost no warm edging (in MZB.Ornit.34.416) to more extensive cinnamon feather edging (in most adult females, especially MZB.Ornit.34.409), the latter leading to an overall warmer underparts impression. Females are variably slightly less slaty on upperparts and crown, and one adult individual (MZB.Ornit.34.416) of unknown sex has a male-like slaty tone on upperparts but a female- like crown color that is more suffused with dull brown. Two juveniles (MZB.Ornit.34.410; MZB.Ornit.34.417) exhibit noticeable mottling on their mantle and underparts coloration, caused by dark brownish-black feather margins contrasting against the paler (on underparts sometimes warm cinnamon) feather centers.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new taxon was first discovered on 8 and 9 April 2009 by FER near its type locality on the occasion of a hike to the highest elevations on Taliabu that was cut short by heavy rainfall. Subsequent sightings on 14 and 15 April 2009 were made in the same area on the occasion of a return visit (

48

). We found this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected the type along with the accompanying specimens.

<tp:taxon-name>
T. poliocephalus

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
With approximately 50 subspecies, the Island Thrush 
<tp:taxon-name>
Turdus poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
is arguably the most polytypic bird species on Earth (
13 5
). Attempts to separate this variable species complex into smaller species-level lineages [e.g. (
13 6
)] have been called into question by genetic data showing that plumage characters are not a good predictor of close relationships in this complex (
13 7
). Hence, modern sources generally continue to unite all or most subspecies into one polytypic species. Not unlike some Philippine subspecies previously under study (
13 7
), the new subspecies from Taliabu is phenotypically extremely different from neighboring forms but more closely resembles certain geographically distant subspecies. It is presently best accommodated at the subspecies level. Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic inquiries are needed in the future to assess whether any internal species limits must be drawn within the complex. Such future analyses may well elevate the Taliabu Island Thrush to species level. However, such analyses are currently hampered by a lack of crucial comparative DNA material.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Forehead to crown and nape dark slaty blue (2.5PB 2/2) with slightly scaly appearance generated through narrow black feather centres; the same color, but without the scaly appearance, then continues through mantle and scapulars to rump. A white supercilium starts above the centre of the eye and ends just shy of the bill base, becoming narrower towards the front. A black facial patch centred in the loral region and below the supercilium to the chin (with narrow rows of black feathers above the bill base) grades into dark slaty blue coloration (2.5PB 1.5/2) towards the auriculars and the malar and moustachial regions, merging with the nape and mantle. Upperwing coverts largely concolorous with crown, with vestiges of an extremely indistinct brighter carpal patch visible with difficulty on this specimen. Remiges are dark slaty brown (10YR 2.5/1), the larger primaries with warmer, paler outer edging (10YR 4/2). Breast intensely rufous (7.5YR 7/12), becoming slightly paler on throat and upper flanks, and becoming pale cinnamon-whitish on belly and lower flanks (7.5YR 9/4), and eventually off-white on undertail coverts. Tail dull black on upper side, blackish-grey (N2) on underside, with indistinct white base to outermost rectrices. Iris dark-brown; legs light-pink; black bill with pinkish gape flange on live bird.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
An unequivocal member of the Snowy-browed Flycatcher 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ficedula hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
, and one of its most easterly outposts, with minor plumage distinctions in the male and major plumage distinctions in the female, a combination of which conclusively demarcates this new taxon from other subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
The male subtly differs from adjacent insular subspecies to the south and to the west, namely from the two Sulawesi subspecies (
jugosae, annalisa
), from 
sumatrana
(Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo), from 
vulcani
(Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores), and from 
alifura
(Buru), in the reduction of white patches at the base of the outer tail feathers, and in the slightly less extensive rufous underparts, replaced on the belly by pale cinnamon- whitish. In contrast, males of the only subspecies to the east and north (
pallidipectus
from Bacan Island) are markedly paler on the underparts than the males of this new subspecies, and have more contrastingly olive flanks. The white supercilium in males of the new subspecies is narrower than that of at least 
sumatrana, vulcani
, and 
alifura
.
</p>
            <p>
The female is highly distinct from most subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
in her bluish (versus olive, brown or grey-brown) upperparts coloration, extensive cold-brown mottling on breast (versus little to none), and a washed-out face pattern ghosting that of the male, with a whiter (versus rufous) brow. The only other subspecies that equals female 
F. h. betinabiru
in her bluish tinge to the upperparts is 
alifura
from adjacent Buru, in which the back color is ever so slightly brighter-blue. Compared to the new subspecies, the female of 
alifura
exhibits a more rufous (less white) eye brow, and brighter and more extensive rufous underparts with less brown mottling.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>
Only adult specimens have been procured, although a photo of a 
pullus
near the nest suggests an early juvenile plumage similar to other subspecies. Among adults, tarsus color as recorded in the field on live birds appears to vary individually from light-pink to pinkish-horn.
</p>
            <p>There is minor variation among the nine adult male specimens procured in the lower extent of the rufous breast, the intensity of the cinnamon wash to the belly, thickness of the supercilium and the extent of vestigial white patches on the basal outer rectrices. There is minor variation among the five adult female specimens in the intensity of brown mottling on the underparts, width and paleness of the supercilium and the presence or absence of a slight brownish tinge to the lowermost mantle portion.</p>

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies of Snowy-browed Flycatcher was first encountered by the University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 (
64, 9 8
). Members of that survey found the new taxon predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m) and suggested that it may be a novel subspecies. FER then saw one adult male at 1100m during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu on 5 April 2009 (

48

). We returned to this general area between 6-16 December 2013, where we found 
betinabiru
as one of the most common constituents of the forest interior understorey avifauna and collected the type and accompanying individuals at ~1300m (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
Subspecies 
betinabiru
is currently only known from the understorey of dense montane forest in the highlands of Taliabu at above 800m elevation (
19, 48, 64, 9 8
). Extensive logging has occurred across the highlands of Taliabu, with some parts of the mountains additionally affected by large-scale forest fires (see Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler account in SM3; 

). As an understory inhabitant, 
betinabiru
would be particularly susceptible to this kind of habitat degradation and is therefore probably declining. Nevertheless, it remains extremely common where good habitat persists, as indicated by our high mistnet capture rates (

19

).
</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, Snowy-browed Flycatchers have not been detected on the two other main islands of the Sula Archipelago, although their occurrence is possible at least on Mangole, which rises to 1,127m, while very unlikely on Sanana, which does not rise taller than ~600m. If confirmed on Mangole, it is likely that the local population would refer to the same subspecies 
betinabiru
.
</p>
            <p>
On the adjacent Banggai Archipelago, a single Snowy-browed Flycatcher was recorded once in April 2009 at 800-900m on the tallest island of Peleng (

49

). To the best of our knowledge, there have not been subsequent records from this island despite extensive fieldwork. In the absence of photos or closer details about the single Peleng record, it is impossible to ascertain whether the Peleng population is ascribable to 
betinabiru
, to one of the two Sulawesi races (
annalisa, jugosae
) or to a novel unnamed subspecies.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We describe this new taxon on the basis of its characteristic plumage (especially in females). These plumage distinctions certainly warrant a description at the subspecific level as they exceed those of several more poorly marked subspecies within this complex (e.g. 
annalisa
[Stresemann, 1931], which only subtly differs from 
jugosae
[Riley, 1921]). Bioacoustic variation in this species complex is poorly explored, but the high-pitched courtship vocalization of the new subspecies superficially resembles that of many other subspecies, and playback of songs from other subspecies elicits a ready response from members of this population. Genetic differences between the new taxon and other subspecies remain unexplored.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Crown, nape, ear coverts and neck sides are mid-brown (7.5YR 4/2), with a distinct cinnamon-chestnut forehead extending over eye (7.5YR 4/8). Black rictal bristles. Nape color slowly grading into warmer cinnamon-rufous (2.5YR 4/10) across mantle, scapulars and rump to the basal 60% portion of tail. The outer remiges are mostly dark dusky-brown (7.5YR 2/1), becoming paler and more olive-brown (7.5YR 4/2) towards the inner remiges. All remiges have narrow but intense rufous outer edging concolorous with rump and lower back color. The wing coverts are almost identical to the inner remiges in color, with an increasing intensity and width of bright-rufous feather tipping towards the median and lesser coverts. The distal 40% of the tail is greyish-black (N2), with paler rufous tips (5YR 5/6) on the underside only. Chin and throat form a white triangle delimited below by a conspicuous large black breast patch. A diffuse band of grey coloration (N5) with a black scaly appearance created by black feathers with narrow grey edging demarcates the black breast patch on its lower side. The belly is pale buff (7.5YR 9/8), grading into a richer, fuller hue on the flanks and undertail coverts (7.5YR 5/6). The iris is dark-brown, the bill black with a pinkish base to the lower mandible, and the tarsus on the live bird was described as pinkish- horn.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A mid-sized, rufous-toned 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura
</tp:taxon-name>
typical of a radiation of fantails distributed throughout Australasia. It most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
(

57

), and constitutes the third member of this radiation. Its plumage distinctions from the other two species are subtle yet consistent. However, the most characteristic distinction is its unique courtship vocalization (
7 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, the new species differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Sula Islands in its much narrower, less distinct rufous tips to the underside of the rectrices, in its more distinct black scaling below the black breast patch, and in its more strongly cinnamon-buff (less white) central underparts. The new species’ throat is cleaner white, less interspersed with dusky tips to the feathers.
</p>
            <p>
The new species differs from all three subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi in its wider black portion of the tail and its warmer brown crown and upper mantle. When compared to the geographically most closely adjacent subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni toradja
</tp:taxon-name>
from eastern and central Sulawesi, the new species additionally differs in its cleaner white throat and slightly less conspicuous scaling below the black breast patch, while it is additionally distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
of the Lompobattang Massif in South Sulawesi by its blacker breast patch and by the richer chestnut (less cinnamon) coloration of its brighter body parts (such as supercilium, rear upperparts, flanks and vent).

Etymology

</p>
            <p>The new species’ epithet is in honor of the late Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie (deceased 11 Sep 2019), the third president of the Republic of Indonesia. President Habibie was known as a keen environmentalist and contributed greatly to the science and conservation of nature in Indonesia.</p>

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The only three specimens (all adult; one female, two males) exhibit limited variation in terms of extent of breast patch and black mottling below breast patch that may have been caused by the preparation of the specimens.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new species has doubtless been known to the local inhabitants of Peleng Island for a long time. Mochamad Indrawan was presumably the first outside ornithologist to see this new bird when encountering a dead individual during his work on Peleng in the mid-2000s and re- encountering the species in the wild on several undated occasions (

49

). During a field trip between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently observed the species near the type locality (

49

), where we returned from 18-23 Dec 2013 to collect the type and the accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new species is restricted to montane forest on the island of Peleng, the largest landmass in the Banggai Archipelago, at elevations not lower than 750m (

19
, 
49

) (

). Over two longer visits to the highlands of Peleng, we found that the species becomes gradually more common towards higher elevations before it seems to drop out somewhere slightly below the tallest peak on Peleng at 1,022m. The new species is replaced on Sulawesi to the west by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
, and on the Sula Archipelago to the east by 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Its occurrence on other islands of the Banggai Archipelago is highly unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
must be considered threatened given the small extent of its occurrence and the continuing loss of its habitat. Only 25,071 ha of land on Peleng fall above the approximate 750m elevational cutoff, most of it formerly constituting a single contiguous block of highland forest (

). However, our own observations in combination with satellite imagery indicate extensive forest loss to small-scale agriculture and logging by burgeoning village communities. Google Earth’s present coverage of the area is mixed, with large swathes covered by insufficient or outdated (e.g., 2004) imagery. However, given current satellite coverage, a conservative estimate is that 9,987 ha (~40%) from within the elevational range of

have either been completely deforested or constitute young regrowth or unviable forest fragments surrounded by clearings. This would leave only 15,084 ha of more or less undisturbed primary or older secondary forest. Recent observations indicate, however, that this extent of forest loss is probably an underestimate. After the first discovery of this species and a number of other new bird taxa on Peleng (

49

), the island became a destination for an average of 1-3 international adventure and birdwatching tour groups per year, which considerably helped spur the local economy of the village near the type locality (name withheld). While this sort of ecotourism has a positive impact on the natural environment in many reported cases, on Peleng the sudden influx of tourist dollars led to observations of increased logging and expansion of infrastructure, prompting the rapid destruction of forest at the original type locality over the last five years. In the near future, it will be of paramount importance for the survival of Peleng’s unique montane fauna to find ways in which the influx of eco-tourism dollars can create incentives for conservation.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
Based on its plumage coloration, the new species is clearly a member of the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, hitherto known from Sulawesi and the Sula Archipelago (

57

). The discovery of a new constituent of this radiation on the Banggai Archipelago closes the geographic gap between Sulawesi and Sula. Most previous taxonomic treatises (e.g. 
6 1, 7 5
) have regarded all members of this radiation as conspecific, and indeed plumage differences are relatively minor and have long been interpreted as consistent with a subspecific treatment. However, recent research into patterns of bioacoustic and genomic differentiation among rusty-bellied fantails from Sulawesi, Sula and Banggai has produced strong evidence in favor of species level treatment of all three island populations (
7 2
).

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="biology_ecology">
            <p>
Vocalizations
: Bioacoustically, the courtship vocalization (=song) of the new species from Peleng is the most distinct of any member of the radiation. A detailed characterization of this song has been published elsewhere (

49

). In fact, when we first found the species in the field, the bird stood out through its unusual, simple descending song that lacks the typical complex tinkling quality of its congeners (

49

). Quantitative bioacoustic comparisons revealed that the unusual vocal features of the new Peleng species have led to an acoustic leapfrog pattern in rusty-bellied fantails in which the two terminal (=easternmost and westernmost) species (i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) are more similar to each other in courtship vocalizations but are geographically divided by the new species with its unusual song (
7 2
). The great vocal distinctness of the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
is surprising because it belies its geographic proximity to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
(Sulawesi)
</tp:taxon-name>
across a combined lowland and sea gap of less than 40km and its frequent land connection to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
(Taliabu)
</tp:taxon-name>
across Pleistocene land bridges during times of global cooling (

49

). Vocal behavior is known to be an important feature in species cohesion and reproductive isolation in songbirds (
7 6, 77
), and has been shown to be more important as an indicator of species limits than plumage traits in some passerine lineages (

78

). Therefore, recent authors have accepted the unmistakable vocal uniqueness of the new Peleng fantail as an indication of its status as an undescribed new species (
57, 7 2
).

Genomic data
: In a previously published analysis (
7 2
), we conducted a comparison of&gt;11,000 genome-wide markers with a complete representation among 16 individuals spanning all three species within the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. In this analysis, the new species from Peleng emerged as most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (both subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
toradja
) and less closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sula. This phylogenomic result is significant considering that – among all pairwise vocal comparisons – the greatest bioacoustic differentiation is found between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and the new species, with strong vocal distinctions in both non-courtship vocalizations and courtship songs (
7 2
). Therefore, the relatively shallowest genomic differentiation among the three island populations corresponds to the deepest bioacoustic divergence.
</p>
            <p>
Although the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
emerged as most closely related within the radiation, comparisons of genome-wide data allow for the designation of both taxa as independent species: the basal split between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other taxa is mainly based on a genomic signal contained in ~20% of the genetic variance across study loci, whereas the second most dominant genomic signature – contained in ~14% of the genetic variance across markers – predominantly represents the deep divergence between the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
[

in (
7 2
)]. The presence of a significant proportion of genomic locus cohorts displaying deep differentiation between the new species and either of its two neighbors was in agreement with gene flow analyses (‘ABBA-BABA tests’) that pointed to a history of rare introgression between the new species and its neighbors (
7 2
), perhaps during episodes of unusual climate forcing dispersal between islands. Such secondary introgression is not unusual among congeneric bird species (

79

) and is not in conflict with species level treatment.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>
The entire crown from forehead to nape is rich earthen-brown (7.5YR 3/3) with slightly darker feather margins creating a scalloped appearance. A thin off-white supercilium is pronounced from bill base to just behind eye, from where it slowly tapers out. Lores are dark brownish-black (2.5Y 1.5/1). Ear coverts are of a medium earthen-brown tone (5YR 3/1) with fine pale shaft streaks giving a grizzled appearance, grading into a more greyish-brown tone (10YR 6/1) in the moustachial and malar region. The mantle and scapulars down to the uppertail coverts are largely concolorous with the crown but lack the scalloping created by darker feather margins. The remiges are mostly a rich cold dark-brown (2.5YR 2/1) but have warmer outer webs concolorous with mantle. The upperwing coverts are similarly two-toned, being mostly concolorous with mantle but some showing darker outer webs concolorous with most of remiges. As typical for the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
, the rectrices are narrow and dark- brown, very close in color to the remiges (2.5YR 2/1). The tail feathers are mostly worn, although one in the centre appears to be a new replacement.
</p>
            <p>The white chin and throat are quite sharply demarcated from the face. The lower throat and upper breast, still white, are interspersed with fine dusky speckling increasing towards the breast and lower throat sides where the color grades into a solid mid-grey (N5) with only few inconspicuous dusky speckles. The grey breast color then grades into a tawny- ochraceous belly color (7.5YR 4/6), first through tracts of grey feathers which have warm- ochraceous edging, then through tracts of largely ochraceous feathers that still have a grey feather centre, eventually to all-ochraceous feathers. The belly color becomes darker and richer on the undertail coverts and flanks (7.5YR 3/4).</p>
            <p>The bill is black with an inconspicuous paler tip. The gape on the live bird was slightly enlarged light yellow. The iris is dark brown. The tarsus and toes were described on the live bird as maroon-horn with paler, more yellowish toepads.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A rich dark-brown forest warbler typical of the montane resident 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. As is usual across this cryptic genus, the new taxon is most conspicuous not on the basis of its plumage but its vocalizations.
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, it is most similar in size and shape to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
of Sulawesi. However, in comparison to the new taxon, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
has less distinct speckling on the breast, has a more uniform crown that is less scalloped, paler and warmer brown upperparts, greyer underparts with brown mostly only on flanks, and has a less pointed, wider tail.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram differs in its less distinct central breast spotting, greyer (less whitish) supercilium, and more extensive grey on breast reaching further onto upper breast, neck sides and auriculars.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru differs in its much whiter breast, with off-white reaching onto mid-belly, whereas only the lower flanks and lower belly are warm-brown. Although the central breast of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
has a mid-grey tinge, its underparts are much paler than the new species’ fairly uniform grey lower breast, which grades into a fairly dark homogeneous warm-brown belly.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is quite different from the smaller 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. montis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Java. The latter is much paler cinnamon-brown on upperparts, crown and especially remiges and rectrices, and is uniformly buff-white below with extensive dark-brown speckling from chin to upper belly, lacking the new species’ grey tones on the breast and dark warm-brown tones on the belly.

The name 
<tp:taxon-name>
portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
– past participle of Latin ‘portendere’ – roughly translates as “the predicted one” or “the foretold one” and relates to the unusual circumstances of discovery when FER first heard the new warbler and recognized it to be a novel species of

multiple days before a visual confirmation was obtained.

            <p>Currently only one adult specimen is available (i.e., the holotype), and photos of up to two more adults suggest that this is probably a sexually monomorphic species with limited plumage variation.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
FER was the first person to discover 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on 9 April 2009 near its type locality when he heard an unmistakable insect-like sound that he attributed to a hitherto unnamed taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
grasshopper-warbler. Having been exposed to the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on a visit to Sulawesi only two weeks prior, and having had previous field experience with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru and Seram, respectively (
8 0
), FER was aware that the song of this population – albeit superficially reminiscent of the others – is distinct at the species level. Even so, because of the retiring nature of this bird and ill-timed heavy rain, it took FER another two hiking expeditions to the highlands of Taliabu to finally confirm on 15 April 2009 that this song was indeed uttered by what he perceived as an “unusually dark” individual of grasshopper-warbler (

48

). We encountered this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected a single specimen, now the holotype.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is presumably restricted to montane forest at the highest elevations of the island of Taliabu (

19
, 
48

) (

). All our records are from elevations above 1,050m on the more mountainous western half of the island of Taliabu, which reaches its highest altitude of ~1,415m at an unnamed peak near our collection locality (

). The new species inhabits a peculiar type of dwarf montane forest typical of these elevations.
</p>
            <p>
The occurrence of the new species on neighboring islands is highly doubtful. Of the three major islands that form the Sula archipelago, Taliabu is the largest and tallest. The smallest main island, Sanana, barely reaches above 600m elevation. The highest elevation on its larger neighbor Mangole is 1,127m – theoretically within the elevational range of this grasshopper-warbler – but the area of land above 1,050m on Mangole is only ~36 ha, which is too small an area to allow for the survival of a highly montane bird species throughout evolutionary time scales. On the neighboring Banggai archipelago, the situation is similar: the only island high enough to allow for the theoretical possibility of grasshopper-warbler breeding occurrence is Peleng (highest elevation ~1,022m), but extensive fieldwork around this highest area has not revealed the presence of any resident grasshopper-warblers (

19
, 
49

).
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
must be a rare bird: Taliabu’s area above 1,050m amounts to ~16,690 ha of formerly forested land in the interior of the island’s western half, over 97% of which forms one contiguous block (

). However, satellite imagery predominantly from 2004 indicates that a total of ~1,023 ha (~6.1%) of this area had been affected by logging operations that have degraded the forest and removed its undercover, presumably rendering the affected areas unsuitable, or nearly so, for the grasshopper-warbler. In the one-and-a-half decades since the satellite images were obtained, extensive additional logging is likely to have occurred. Another 940 ha (~5.6%) of the area above 1,050m have succumbed to a series of catastrophic forest fires in 1982 and 1983, and now constitute open grassland habitat unsuitable for this warbler (

). Our surveys showed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
does not occur in the extensive recently generated grasslands in the highlands of Taliabu (

48

). This leaves 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
with less than 15,000 ha of suitable habitat, an area likely to further diminish in size with ongoing habitat destruction and the impacts of global warming leading to an upward elevational shift of habitat zones.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We include this new taxon within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
following the phylogenetic demonstration that the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bradypterus
</tp:taxon-name>
(previously used for this Southeast Asian clade of warblers) is restricted to Africa (
8 1, 8 2
). Its inclusion within 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
is the reason why we follow the recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] of using the English moniker ‘grasshopper-warbler’ rather than the term ‘bush-warbler’, which is more appropriately reserved for members of a radiation in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Cettiidae</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
is renowned for its cryptic and conservative coloration that has confounded plumage-based classifications for decades and led to delays in the recognition of species-level taxa until bioacoustic and molecular methods have been applied (
8 3, 8 4
). In Wallacea, members of a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from Sulawesi and the Moluccas were previously united into a single polytypic species 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
(
6 1, 7 5
), but have recently been divided into three constituent island species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru, on the basis of their strikingly different songs (

57

). Our new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is geographically surrounded by constituents of this radiation and is a member of it both on the basis of morphological characters (see Diagnosis) and bioacoustic ones.
</p>
            <p>
Although plumage distinctions are not as important in the genus, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by comparatively unique, dark-brown upperparts that stand in contrast to the generally paler and warmer-brown upperparts of neighboring species. However, we mainly attribute species status to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on the basis of its unique song and genetic differentiation. We here provide an excerpt of ongoing analyses as relating to the bioacoustic and mitogenomic differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from neighboring species.

Bioacoustic evidence
: A total of 41 suitable, high-quality, homologous 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
song recordings from the field were gathered for analysis from various sources, encompassing all three previous species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation plus the new species. These recordings were measured for 11 suitable bioacoustic parameters, and resultant measurements were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and a conservative vocal diagnosability criterion (

85

), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Further details regarding all analyzed recordings, such as GPS locations, dates, times, and names of recordists, are listed in table S3, while more details on bioacoustic methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
Based on the Isler Criterion, eight out of eleven song parameters measured were diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and two other taxa: 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (table S4). Four out of eleven parameters were Isler-diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (table S4). The ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) can be adopted to ascertain if the level of vocal divergence between these archipelagic taxa is comparable in magnitude to divergences across unequivocal species-level divisions. When comparing Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler song against that of the Friendly Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
, a geographically distant species from montane Borneo that has never been included in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, only two parameters emerged as Isler-diagnosable (table S4). Using this result as a yardstick for what constitutes species level vocal differentiation, the magnitude of vocal divergence between Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
on Seram, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
on Buru, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on Sulawesi is extremely high, indicating they all have diagnosably distinct vocalizations that are best reflected in species rank.
</p>
            <p>
Principal component analysis of the vocal measurements underscores the vocal distinctness of Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from the other three Wallacean species (

). A cumulative proportion of variance of 73.3% is accounted for in the first two principal components, suggesting a strong vocal differentiation between Taliabu and the remaining taxa (

).
</p>
            <p>
Mitogenomic evidence
: Using whole-genome sequencing and laboratory approaches for the use of ancient DNA, we created an alignment of whole-mitochondrial sequences spanning ~15,000 base pairs (bp) across 11 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals belonging to all four constituent island forms of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, and used three different phylogenetic tree-building methodologies to investigate relationships and levels of divergence. More details on the methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
All three phylogenetic trees produced indicated identical topologies with high bootstrap support (

), suggesting that the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is an independent lineage most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (mitogenomic divergence ~2%), and much more distantly related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (divergence ~4.8–5%) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (divergence ~7.7–8%). Mitogenomic divergences roughly correlate with those from the COI barcoding gene, although they do not have to be equal in magnitude.
</p>
            <p>
Integrating the vocal and mitogenomic evidence, it is clear that bioacoustic differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, the two species which emerged most closely related on the mitogenomic tree (

), far exceed those between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and a geographically distant species (
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
) that has never been closely associated with the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. Our combined evidence therefore supports the treatment of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
as a well-diverged small-insular endemic species.

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic sampling:
We obtained 41 homologous recordings, which were either recorded by us in the field, or privately sourced from avid field ornithologists (including Robert O. Hutchinson and Ross Gallardy), or collected from publicly accessible online databases, namely the Avian Vocalization Center (AVoCet at http://avocet. integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu), the Xeno-Canto Sound Library (www.xeno-canto.org), the Macaulay Sound Library (www.macaulaylibrary.org), and the Internet Bird Collection (www.hbw.com/ibc).
</p>
            <p>Although slight variation in recording quality exists in the equipment used, inspection and comparison of spectrograms from different devices showed that this variation is comparable to that amongst recordings made by one sole recordist using the same device. In addition, although there is some variability in background noise, spectrogram inspection suggested that measurements of vocalizations would not be affected. Measurements of the recordings were performed using the program Raven Pro Version 1.5 (Bioacoustics Research Program, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA) on its default settings. The following eleven parameters were chosen for bioacoustic analysis, with each parameter averaged over all the measurements across one recording:</p>

Bioacoustic analysis:
The vocal diagnosability criterion outlined by Isler et al. (
8 5
), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, was used to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Besides other oscine passerines (
73, 8 6
), this criterion has been employed as a bioacoustic species delimitation method across Asian birds such as owls (

58
, 
87

), pigeons (

50
, 
52
, 
88

), and nightjars (

89

). The Isler criterion has two parts which must be fulfilled in order to infer diagnosability. Firstly, the range of measurements of a parameter between two taxa must not exhibit overlap, and secondly, the data have to satisfy the following equation: 
xa
+ 
taSDa ≤xb–tbSDb,
where (
x
) refers to the respective means of measurements in taxon a and b, and 
ti
refers to the t-score at the 95th percentile of the t distribution for 
n-1
degrees of freedom. This is a stricter statistical test than the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (
8 5
) as it employs the standard deviation of the sample points instead of the taxon mean, allowing for the diagnosis of distinctions between taxa under more rigorous conditions. Successful Isler diagnosability is defined here as the presence of at least one vocally diagnostic parameter between taxa.

DNA extraction methods:
Fresh tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
was DNA- sequenced along with the following number of toepad scrapings of historical museum specimens: three of the Buru Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, three of the Seram Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and four of the Sulawesi Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
. All museum samples had been kindly contributed by the American Museum of Natural History (for voucher numbers, see 

and table S5). DNA extraction was carried out with the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extraction of the historic museum specimens’ toepad scrapings was conducted by trained personnel (CYG) in a room dedicated to ancient DNA extraction to preclude DNA contamination. The toepads were rinsed with water four times before extraction to ensure preservatives were removed, and DTT was added to facilitate digestion of keratin present in toepads. The concentrations of the DNA extracts were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay.
</p>
            <p>
DNA sequencing methods:
The holotype’s DNA extract was sheared into smaller fragments of ~250 base pairs (bp) using 13 cycles of 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off on a Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode, USA). Whole-genome library preparation for the holotype was carried out using a NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, USA) for Illumina according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the museum toepad extracts, the shearing step was omitted as the ancient DNA is already degraded and NEBNext FFPE DNA repair mix (New England Biolabs, USA) was added to each ancient DNA sample prior to library preparation to fix damage common to degraded DNA such as deamination, nicks and gaps. In addition, size selection of library preparation products was omitted for the toepad samples to reduce DNA loss from bead selection. A total of five PCR cycles were run on the holotype’s DNA extract and 12 PCR cycles on the toepads’ extracts. Whole-genome library preparation of toepad samples was carried out in a room with a PCR hood dedicated to ancient library preparation work. The concentrations and peak fragment sizes of the libraries were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay and an Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer (Agilent, USA), respectively. The peak fragment sizes of the historic museum samples and the fresh holotype (including adaptors and unique indexes) were ~230bp and ~380bp, respectively. All prepared libraries were sent to NovogeneAIT Genomics Singapore for Illumina sequencing using a HiSeq 4000 platform to produce 150bp paired-end reads.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial genome alignment
: Trimmomatic (version 0.33) (

90

) was used to remove adaptors and filter low quality reads (below 15 Phred quality score). We applied the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (version 0.7.15-r1140) (
9 1
) to align reads to a mitochondrial reference genome, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella pryeri
</tp:taxon-name>
(Genbank accession no.: NC_029151), with a minimum mapping quality score of 30. Samtools (version 1.9) (
9 2, 9 3
) was run to convert the SAM output files from the alignment to a BAM format for downstream analysis. Then Picard (version 2.18.21; http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) was employed to insert read groups and remove PCR duplicate artifacts. The BAM files were then imported into CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0.4 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com) for remapping to the same reference genome using the following mapping parameters: mismatch penalty of 1, insertion penalty of 1, and deletion penalty of 1. The reads were locally realigned at indel regions, and the consensus sequences were extracted at a minimum coverage threshold of 100. A mapping summary produced by Qualimap (version 2.2.1) (
9 4
) indicated that our mitochondrial genome coverage ranged between ~290–2920x for museum samples and ~6430x for the holotype (table S5). Sequences are deposited with GenBank at accession numbers 
MN597052
- 
MN597062
.
</p>
            <p>
Phylogenetic analysis
: The consensus sequences were exported in FASTA format and visually realigned in MEGA7 (

95

), producing a final whole-mitochondrial alignment of ~15,000bp. MEGA7 was used to construct a neighbor-joining tree based on uncorrected p- divergences and a maximum parsimony tree. Additionally, we ran raxmlGUI 1.5 beta (

96

) to construct a maximum likelihood tree using the GTRGAMMA model as specified by jModelTest (version 2.1.7) (

97

). All tree-building analyses were conducted with 10,000 bootstrap replicates. Pairwise uncorrected p-divergences across the mitogenomic alignment were calculated in MEGA7 with 10,000 bootstrap replicates.

            <p>Head and mantle down to uppertail coverts and to central belly are bright scarlet-red (7.5R 4/14) with subtle blackish suffusion owing to individual feathers having broad red distal half followed by black and then increasingly greyish basal half; jet-black narrow orbital ring and loral line. Upperwings, sides of mantle, scapulars and rectrices are matt black, with the remiges appearing slightly duskier black because of narrow olive edging to outer webs; underwing coverts and outer webs of the underside of remiges are whitish; a blackish-grey (N1.5) wedge extends from vent up to central belly.

The diagnosis refers to the adult male plumage only. Female 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals of the Wallacean radiation are generally very similar across species, and more research is needed to identify good distinguishing marks.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is an obvious, bright scarlet-and-black representative of the Wallacean grouping of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters that have often been united within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
complex (
6 1, 7 5
), but have been considered a radiation of independent species by more recent authors [e.g. (

57

)]. Within this radiation, the new species most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species has a more extensive and brighter red body and blacker wings, scapulars, and tail. Scarlet feathers in the new species are mostly black and grey at the base, with only the distal half scarlet, and with a sharp contrast between scarlet and black, lacking 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
’s narrow yellow bands in between the red and black portions of each individual feather that render the latter’s overall body more orange-tinted. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the red is not as extensive on the underparts, and the abdomen and vent are paler buff-white versus blackish-grey in the new species.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species is paler and greyer (not black) on vent and abdomen. It also has a smudgier scarlet body coloration (caused by the black and grey basal halves of individual feathers), with dark smudges especially pronounced on face and on breast sides, as compared to more uniform red underparts, head and mantle in 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
. Black lores in the new species are wider and not as clearly delimited as in 
<tp:taxon-name>

.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis

Etymology

</p>
            <p>We name this species after the village of Wahe (1.716°S, 124.843°E), which is the gateway to the highest elevations on Taliabu where it most commonly occurs. The species epithet is an indeclinable noun in apposition.</p>

Individual, age-related and sexual variation within taxon

</p>
            <p>
Two adult male specimens (holotype and 34.356) are virtually identical in coloration. Two additional male specimens (34.373 and 34.403), most likely immatures, are similar but have the scarlet body color replaced with a more rose-red hue (5R 4/14); they also do not exhibit any distinct olive margins of remiges. No comparative specimen material exists for adult females of the new species, which are generally similar among all regional 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species. Photos confirm that the female of the new species resembles other regional species (data not shown). One juvenile specimen (34.407) lacks red coloration and is generally drab grayish-brown (paler on underparts), becoming more intense earthen-brown on the mantle, rump and upperwing coverts, with the underside of remiges and rectrices mid-grey.

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
was first spotted by a University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 led by P.J. Davidson. Participants of this exploratory survey were probably the first ornithologists to visit the highlands of Taliabu between 600-800 m elevation (
64, 9 8
), where they found the new species predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m). FER then encountered the species commonly during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu between 4-18 April 2009 (

19
, 
48

), where we returned between 6-16 December 2013 to collect the holotype and accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has thus far only been found on the island of Taliabu within the Sula Archipelago. On Taliabu, we have recorded it from sea level to 1,300m (

19
, 
48

), and it presumably occurs further up all the way to the highest elevation at ~1,415m. The species inhabits forest canopy and edge habitat, and is a nectarivore and frugivore that has been photographed feeding at flowers (

48

). Akin to multiple other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species in Wallacea (

57

), the new species is seen far more often at higher elevations (roughly above ~800m) than in the lowlands. Davidson et al. (

64

), who first sighted this species, exclusively found it at higher elevations, mostly around ~800m, and we recorded it as “abundant” above 800m, whereas we have only had a handful of sightings in the lowlands. It is unknown to what extent elevational differences in abundance reflect the difficulty of detecting a canopy bird in tall lowland forest as compared to stunted montane forest. However, although detection difficulties may help mask its true abundance in the lowlands, we do not believe it is possible for the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
to be equally common across elevations given that other small canopy birds do not escape detection in the lowlands and are recorded commonly. In fact, the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
may even be a breeding endemic to montane elevations and only venture into the lowlands seasonally, following tree flowering and fruiting events. This potential seasonal displacement would explain why some expeditions have completely overlooked it in the lowlands while others have recorded it on occasion.
</p>
            <p>
It is contentious whether the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
is endemic to Taliabu, or also occurs on the other two main islands of the Sula Archipelago (Mangole and Sanana). The latter two have received even less ornithological attention than Taliabu, and to the best of our knowledge, the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has never been recorded there on recent ornithological expeditions (D. Yong, pers. comm.; J.A. Eaton, pers. comm.). Sanana is relatively low-lying (up to ~600m) and therefore likely to lack a number of Taliabu’s montane species. Mangole reaches its highest peak at 1,127m, but areas above 800m are confined to ~328 ha only, which gives it a comparatively small area of true montane forest. The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
’s level of dependence on vegetation at high elevations probably determines whether it would be capable of occurring on Mangole or even Sanana. Future fieldwork on those two islands will shed light on whether the new species occurs there or not.
</p>
            <p>
FER and Filip Verbelen first discovered a new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
population in the mountains of Peleng in the neighboring Banggai Archipelago during a visit between 23-30 March 2009 and recorded it as reasonably common at elevations between 700-900m in the western Peleng highlands (

49

). On our collecting expedition, we only had one aural encounter of this 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
on Peleng on 21 Dec 2013, indicating that the population might have been seasonally displaced or more retiring (

19

). However, photographic evidence from the 2009 visit indicates that the Peleng population has a plumage coloration that is very similar – if not identical – to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and quite different from 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
. As this Peleng population remains uncollected, future fieldwork will hopefully produce specimens allowing a determination whether there are differences between the Peleng birds and 
<tp:taxon-name>

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu is obviously a member of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, which used to be considered a single wide-ranging polytypic species for a long time (
6 1, 7 5
), but has now been divided into multiple monotypic island endemics by most recent authors on the basis of extensive plumage differences [e.g. (
57, 8 0, 99
)]. Within this radiation, its plumage most closely resembles that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, but is discrete from both of them in multiple characters (see Diagnosis). Its morphological differences from both 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
exceed those between other closely related species pairs within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. dammermani
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
(

73

). Therefore, its diagnosis here as a species level taxon rests on Mayr and Ashlock’s (

70

) yardstick approach, by which species status is conferred on the basis of divergences that exceed those of species pairs in which biologically important differences have been unequivocally demonstrated.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters have a wide vocal repertoire that is oftentimes problematic in the context of bioacoustic analysis (

73

). The Taliabu 
<tp:taxon-name>Myzomela</tp:taxon-name>
was hardly vocal during our encounters, and we do not consider vocalizations a fruitful taxonomic avenue in delimiting this new species from others. Instead, we have generated mitochondrial sequence data to further shed light on the new species’ taxonomic status.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial evidence
: Our mitochondrial tree analysis was based on sequences of the coding gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), comparing 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
to a great majority of members of the eastern and central Indonesian radiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters. Results indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
is most closely related to geographically adjacent species such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (

). Our analysis does not provide resolution on whether either 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
constitute the sister species to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
, and in fact, the latter two may well be sister to each other instead (

), rendering 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
a more basal species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from adjacent Buru is not represented in our mitochondrial dataset, and likely forms part of this group. Based on plumage coloration, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
is frequently considered to constitute the sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, and the two are sometimes merged under one species [e.g. (

99

)]. Therefore, we assume that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
– albeit closely related – will probably not emerge as the direct sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
in future analyses.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial ND2 divergence values between 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
and its two most closely related relatives (

<tp:taxon-name>M. elisabethae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chloroptera</tp:taxon-name>

) range between 3.5%–4.3% (

), well above the mitochondrial divergence threshold of 2-3% widely postulated in the literature (
10 0, 10 1
), providing additional support for species level recognition of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial analysis:
We extracted DNA from the breast muscle tissue of all our 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
material (n = 5), and from four independently collected 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
samples (

73

), using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. ND2 was then sequenced following Lim et al. (
10 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Using CodonCode Aligner version 8.0.2. (CodonCode, USA), our ND2 sequences were trimmed and assembled. These sequences of 991 bp length were then aligned in MEGA7 (
9 5
) with the ND2 sequences of 23 other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>The crown (from forehead to nape) is cold brown (2.5Y 2/2), delimited below by a narrow long white supercilium from bill base to napeside. Lores dark greyish brown (2.5Y 3/1) extending to just behind eye in the form of an eyestripe cutting through a broken white eye ring formed by small feathers peripheral to the eye. Black rictal bristles. Ear coverts and malar, facial and moustachial regions show white-and-dusky grizzling. Most of upperparts, including mantle, scapulars and rump, are mid-olive (5Y 4/4), while remiges are distinctly darker-olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). The white chin and throat are characterized by sporadic dusky speckles and lemon streaks increasing towards the lower throat, and grading into a fully lemon to sulphur yellow breast and belly (5Y 9/12). The yellow on the breast and belly has an olive-mottled appearance because of olive feather tips (5Y 4/4), especially pronounced towards the flanks, and white feather bases, especially pronounced towards the abdomen. The vent is solid lemon-yellow (5Y8/7). Iris dark-brown; bill black. Tarsus, toes and claws pinkish-grey with toepads paler yellowish.</p>

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The new species name is derived from “suara merdu” in Bahasa Indonesia, translating as “melodious voice”, referring to the pleasing vocalizations of this bird that FER heard hours before the first individual was seen, allowing for predictions prior to visual confirmation that this would be a new

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
During a visit to the highlands of Peleng between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently encountered this species at elevations between 700-900m (

49

). When hiking up to these elevations for the first time and hearing the melodious warble of this taxon in the distance, its superficial vocal resemblance to other members of the Wallacean 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation prompted FER to predict that this would be a new leaf-warbler taxon long before they laid their eyes on it. Once they first saw it, it was noticeable for its unusual behavior of frequently climbing along larger branches and trunks of trees in the manner of a treecreeper (
<tp:taxon-name>
Certhia
</tp:taxon-name>
). On our collecting expedition to Peleng between 18-23 Dec 2013, the species was less commonly encountered (

19

), probably because of seasonality.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new leaf-warbler is restricted to the highland forests of western Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago at elevations above 700m, reaching the highest island altitude above 1000m (

). Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago must be in serious doubt because only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, of which only 5 ha of land lie above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. Beyond the Banggai Archipelago,

Lemon ear coverts down to malar and moustachial regions (5Y 9/10) grizzled with dusky-olive feather edging, making for a mottled facial appearance. Upperparts from mantle and scapulars to rump are mid-olive (7.5Y 4/6). Remiges are distinctly darker- olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). Underparts from chin to vent are largely lemon to sulphur yellow, with white feather bases creating a more lemon-yellow hue on throat, breast and belly (7.5Y 8/8) and olive feather tips (5Y 4/4) generating a more olive- mottled appearance on flanks, while the undertail coverts are largely uniform lemon (5Y 9/12).</p>

<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
A University of East Anglia expedition by Davidson et al. (

64

) was the first to find a resident population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers on Taliabu, which they encountered commonly in montane forest and which they considered to represent an undescribed taxon. Rheindt (

48

) then studied this leaf warbler during his visit between 4-18 April 2009, and we found them again during our expedition between 6-16 Dec 2 013 and collected two (

19

).

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>
Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new warbler inhabits disturbed and undisturbed montane forest on Taliabu from 700m up to probably the highest elevations above 1,400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). It may also occur on the large neighboring island of Mangole, which rises to 1,127m and should harbor enough area of montane forest habitat above 700m to sustain a population. However, a lack of fieldwork in the mountains of Mangole means that there is no information available on its montane avifauna. The smallest main constituent of the Sula Archipelago, the densely populated island of Sanana, is unlikely to sustain any 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers as it barely reaches above 600m, which seems to be too low for this species. The species is replaced on the Banggai Archipelago by the newly described 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
(see SM5), while 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
replace it in various parts of Sulawesi. Given its more relaxed elevational requirements and its tolerance for disturbed habitat, this species is probably not as immediately endangered as some of the other montane Taliabu avifauna.

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
)


</p>
            <p>
The leaf-warbler genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
constitutes a large Old World radiation of small passerines that is exceptionally well-studied in phylogenetic terms (
10 6-1 09
). Recent demonstrations of genus paraphyly in combination with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
[summarized in (
10 8
)] have prompted a variety of new generic treatments, including a division into two re-defined genera [
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
; see (

57

)], but we here follow the latest phylogenetic treatise that suggests a merger of all 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
into a single genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
10 8
).
</p>
            <p>
Despite the genus’s well-known evolutionary history, a sizeable sub-clade of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Australasian (including Indonesian) Archipelago has largely been omitted from modern molecular insights. Notable exceptions include the first-ever example of a new avian species description (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. rotiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) partly based on genome-wide DNA data from the Timor region (
11 0
). However, most island populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
in this region have been merged into a limited number of ‘wastebasket species’, e.g. Mountain Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trivirgatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and Island Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
, although vocal and plumage differences among them often far exceed those documented among the better- studied continental groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
8 0
). As a consequence, some modern treatments [e.g. (

57

)] have adopted a ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) in which pairwise plumage and vocal differences between archipelagic taxa that are comparable in magnitude to those between better-studied continental species pairs (or exceed them) are interpreted as being indicative of species status. In this way, a number of highly distinct island taxa have been elevated to species level, such as Buru Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. everetti
, Seram Leaf Warbler
</tp:taxon-name>
               <tp:taxon-name>
P. ceramensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[a treatment that had previously been suggested on the basis of vocal and plumage comparisons; see (

80

)], and a number of additional Wallacean taxa. Our description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
follows this framework of affording species rank to taxa when vocal and plumage characters indicate deeper divisions. We also bring genome-wide DNA data to bear on the taxonomic classification of these two new species. However, following the yardstick approach as applied under the Biological Species Concept, we believe that biological characters, especially bioacoustic ones, will be the most important indicators when conferring species status in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers.
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: As for plumage characters, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
differ from each other and from surrounding taxa in a number of important traits (see Diagnosis for each taxon) which are far more salient than the plumage differences of often identical-looking species pairs on the Asian continent that are otherwise vocally and phylogenetically deeply diverged [e.g. the three members of the Arctic Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. borealis
</tp:taxon-name>
trio; (
11 1
)]. Most importantly, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
has a contrastingly white throat and supercilium and a grey-and-white grizzled auricular patch where all other surrounding taxa are much more yellowish, rendering it instantly recognizable in large series of specimens. In contrast, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is superficially reminiscent of Sulawesi Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
in its overall more yellowish coloration, displaying a phenotypic leapfrog pattern that has been documented from the Taliabu-Peleng-Sulawesi island trio on multiple previous occasions (
50, 7 2
). However, this superficial resemblance notwithstanding, it has important distinctions in bare-parts coloration and overall pigmentation (see Diagnosis), apart from obvious vocal differences.

Bioacoustic evidence
: In bioacoustic terms, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by melodious jumbles of 1–1.5sec, mostly at 2000–6000 Hz, with short individual high notes between 5000–7000 Hz occasionally interspersed. Song motifs generally lack repetitive element sequences or trills (

). In contrast, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by 1.5–3sec strophes mostly between 2000–6500 Hz (typically of a wider frequency range than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
) that constitute a melodious jumble often followed by a final repetitive phrase, which can sometimes be omitted (

). In this respect, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is slightly more reminiscent of the East Sulawesi population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng (despite the geographic proximity of the latter two). The 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
population on Gunung Tumpu (East Sulawesi) is often characterized by strong repetitive series at a very broad frequency range (2500–7000 Hz), mostly preceded by a variable but simple melodious series of elements between 2000–5000 Hz and a brief nasal note separating this variable series from the repetitive series (

). Depending on the presence or absence of components, the song rendition (=motif) can be 1.5–4sec long. In summary, the songs of these three forms (

<tp:taxon-name>P. suaramerdu</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. emilsalimi</tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
), while highly variable, are predictably different and strongly indicative of species status when put into the context of song differences among other 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
species (

).

Genomic evidence
: We generated a set of ~4,100 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment spanning almost 3 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial cytochrome- 
b
(cyt- 
b
) sequences, to shed light on the differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in separate Methods paragraphs below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three taxa (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
from East Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population-genomic space based on ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (

). The main division according to genomic PCA occurred between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
versus the other two taxa (PC1 in 

). The same relationship was strongly reflected in maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of concatenated genome-wide sequence alignments of almost 3 million base pairs length as well as in maximum-parsimony (MP) analysis of a concatenated set of ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (topology 1 in 

). In contrast, mitochondrial cyt- 
b
gene analysis and species-tree inference of genome-wide SNPs recovered a topology in which 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
were strongly supported sister lineages, with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
being more basal (topology 2 in 

). Depths of uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence (as determined by cyt- 
b
distances) were comparatively low across all three leaf-warblers (0.7-1.6%; 

).
</p>
            <p>
In summary, our phylogenomic analyses demonstrated considerable incongruence among tree topologies, including a strong mito-nuclear discordance that calls into doubt the reliability of mitochondrial divergence values in this dataset. For instance, the deepest genomic divergence was detected between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other two species (PC1 in 

), whereas on mitochondrial cyt- 
b
evidence 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
displayed some of the most shallow divergences from the other taxa (

). The use of mitochondrial divergences in species delimitation suffers from multiple confounding biases (
79, 10 0, 10 1
), especially when dealing with complexes containing closely-allied allopatric taxa that have a propensity for secondary gene flow (
11 2-11 4
). The best explanatory hypothesis for the pronounced mito- nuclear discordance in this dataset is that occasional overwater dispersal followed by hybridization and gene flow may have led to the introgression of foreign alleles in one or the other species, obfuscating clean branching patterns. Gene flow during sporadic hybridization is known to artifactually reduce mitochondrial divergences, masking deeper levels of genomic differentiation (

79

). Hence, introgression can account for the presence of relatively low mitochondrial divergences in a group of species characterized by comparatively deep genomic divergences and pronounced levels of bioacoustic differentiation [(

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted DNA from the fresh muscle tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and the three specimens collected by us (including the holotype) of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
, along with one individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
that we had collected on Mt Tumpu on the eastern peninsula of Sulawesi (

19

). Additional tissue samples were obtained from the American Museum of Natural History, New York (AMNH): three samples of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
from South Sulawesi and an outgroup sample of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus pallescens
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Solomon Islands. The AMNH samples were only used for phylogenomic rooting. DNA extraction was performed using the Exgene Clinic SV kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul) following the manufacturer’s instructions. We eluted the DNA in two consecutive rounds of 100μl molecular grade water. We prepared double-digest restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing (ddRADSeq) libraries using the same protocol as Garg et al. (
11 5
) with EcoRI and MspI as restriction enzymes. We quantified DNA and library product concentrations using the Qubit 2.0 Broad Range DNA Assay (Invitrogen, California), and used a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Iowa) to perform final quality checks on the library product. The genomic libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform at the Singapore Center for Environmental Life Science Engineering. Filtering and demultiplexing of the genomic data in STACKS 1.34 followed the same general procedures as detailed by Ng et al. (
7 2
), and are the result of comprehensive trials using a wide variety of different parameters and settings at each step of the analysis. DNA data is deposited with Genbank at BioProject accession number PRJNA566263.
</p>
            <p>
SNP calling and genomic supermatrix generation:
Reference genome alignment was performed using BWA 0.7.12 (
9 1
) and samtools 0.1.19 (http://samtools.sourceforge.net) (
9 2, 9 3
) on the Greenish Warbler (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
) genome (
11 6
), the most closely related available full genome. We performed SNP calling in STACKS 1.34 as per Ng et al. (
7 2
). We required loci to be present across all individuals, and retained one random SNP per locus to exclude obviously linked SNP loci. Subsequently, we used PLINK 1.9 (
11 7
) and Bayescan 2.1 (
11 8
) to filter SNPs for linkage disequilibrium and signs of selection. Data format manipulation and conversions were performed with PGDSpider (
1 19
). The final filtered dataset totaled 4,104 SNPs. In addition, we created concatenated SNP datasets for each group for use in downstream maximum parsimony analysis.
</p>
            <p>
Following the procedures used by Ng et al. (
7 2
), we generated a concatenated read supermatrix without missing data using pyRAD (
12 0
). We stipulated a minimum required locus coverage of 20, and kept the clustering threshold within and between reads at the default of 0.88. The final concatenated read supermatrix amounted to 2,861,661 bp in length, generated from 19,985 loci.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial sequence generation:
We sequenced cyt- 
b
using the primers H16065 (
12 1
) and L14995 (
12 2
), with 40 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 72°C. We conducted PCR product cleanup with ExoSAP-IT 
®
and used the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) for cycle- sequencing. Sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer using capillary electrophoresis. We assembled cyt- 
b
sequences with CodonCode Aligner 4.1 and aligned them with ClustalW (
12 3
). The final cyt- 
b
alignment was 1,100bp long, indel- free and fully translatable. Mitochondrial sequences have been deposited with Genbank at accession numbers 
MN518858
- 
MN518862
.
</p>
            <p>
Population structure inference:
In order to test for the presence of geographic structuring across East Sulawesi, Peleng, and Taliabu, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the genomic SNP data. PCA was performed using ade4 (
12 4
) and factoextra (
12 5
), both available as R packages (
12 6
).
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial tree inference:
We constructed phylogenetic cyt- 
b
trees using two methods: maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML). We ran MP analyses using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
), performing 10,000 bootstrap replicates. For ML analyses, we first used jModelTest v2.1.6 (

97

) and determined that the Jukes-Cantor model (
12 8
) was the best performing substitution model. We then ran RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) using the extensive subtree-pruning-regrafting tree search algorithm.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic tree inference:
We applied three different genomic tree inference analyses: coalescent-based species tree inference (applied to the SNP dataset), maximum likelihood tree inference (applied to concatenated read supermatrix), and maximum parsimony tree inference (applied to the concatenated SNP dataset). We performed species tree inference using SNAPP (
1 29
) as implemented in BEAST 2.3.0, performing two iterations using default settings. Tracer 1.6 was used after each iteration to ensure that the runs had reached convergence, after which LogCombiner v2.3.0 and DensiTree (
13 0
) were used to process results. We carried out ML tree inference using RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) on the concatenated read supermatrix using the general-time-reversible gamma-invariant (GTRGAMMA) model and performed 1,000 rapid bootstrap searches. Finally, we conducted conventional MP analysis on the concatenated SNPs of each taxon set, using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
) and running 10,000 bootstrap replicates to evaluate branch support.

Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts are bronzy olive (2.5Y 3/4), the remiges and rectrices slightly darker and with more coppery edging (10YR 4/6). Dull white on breast reaches to chin, with an orange-rufescent tinge (7.5YR 7/6) surrounding the breast laterally and ventrally. Yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, with a rufescent-orange suffusion to flanks (7.5YR 7/6). Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Dark-horn mandible. Yellow-orange tarsus on live bird.

One of the phenotypically most distinct subspecies of the Mountain Tailorbird or Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Uniquely among all subspecies, the new taxon has a rufescent suffusion on throat and breast, becoming especially pronounced on breast sides and auriculars (from where it grades into the rufous crown), rendering the bird’s anterior aspect much warmer-tinged than all other subspecies. The upperparts, especially upper wings, are also warmer bronzy and the flanks tinged more rufescent than all other subspecies, making this the most reddish-looking taxon in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. It additionally differs from most other subspecies (except those from Sulawesi and Peleng) in the rufous crown’s more posterior extension to the nape and in the absence of a pale supercilium.
</p>
            <p>
It further differs from

(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis

malayanus

riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow on belly and lower breast (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near- complete absence of yellow, respectively). For additional differences from the new subspecies on Peleng, see SM8.

Davidson et al. (

<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoiler (then called an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird) for Taliabu, and characterized the population as inhabiting montane forest above 500m and possibly in need of taxonomic description. FER found this population commonly in disturbed montane forest to over 1,100 m, with a few records in dense secondary bamboo thickets down to 50m (

48

), and our collecting expedition re-encountered this form abundantly at elevations around 1,300m (

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, this new subspecies is currently only known from Taliabu in the Sula Archipelago. There, it inhabits disturbed situations (forest edge, bamboo thickets) mostly in the mountains, with the highest record at 1300m, but presumably ranging to the highest point at over 1400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). On other islands, mountain leaftoilers rarely range lower than ~500m (

57

), but Rheindt (

48

) exceptionally recorded the new taxon on Taliabu from an extensive bamboo thicket at ~50m, demonstrating that this population may tolerate lower elevations. The presence of this leaftoiler on the other two main Sula islands, Mangole and Sanana, is likely, especially on the former, which rises to over 1,100m, but perhaps also on the latter, which reaches to a little over 600m. However, it has probably been overlooked owing to a lack of fieldwork at higher elevations on these two islands. On the Banggai Archipelago, the species is represented by another novel subspecies (see below) that replaces 
sulanus
there. Its predilection for disturbed forest situations and wide elevational tolerance as compared to other insular mountain birds probably means that it is currently not of conservation concern.

Crown and nape rich rufous (2.5YR 4/10), slightly darker posteriorly, and not extending as far onto the nape as in the new Taliabu subspecies (
P. c. sulanus
; see SM7). Short blackish eyestripe. Facial region from auriculars to lores dusky-grey (N3) with an increasing rufous suffusion (concolorous with crown) towards the malar and moustachial regions. Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts olive with a slight bronzy hue (5Y 3/4), colder-colored than in the new subspecies from Taliabu (
P. c. sulanus
). Remiges and rectrices are darker and duskier, but with outer edging nearly concolorous with mantle. Underparts are bicolored, with a white chin to breast, and a lemon-yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, and with a dusky olive suffusion on the flanks. Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Tarsus dark-yellow. On the live bird, the upper mandible was black with a yellow tip, and the lower mandible was black with a yellow base and tip. The iris color was not clearly discerned on the live bird.

            <p>
A distinct new subspecies of Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(or ‘Mountain Tailorbird’), differing from adjacent subspecies to the east and to the west in important discrete characters.
</p>
            <p>
The lack of a supercilium and the posterior extension of the rufous crown coloration onto the mid-nape set this subspecies apart from most other subspecies, except those from Sulawesi and Taliabu, which have an equally or sometimes even slightly more extensive rufous crown. It further differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis
(Borneo), 
malayanus
(Malay Peninsula) and all subspecies further west and north in the absence of a strong grey hindcollar band and/or strongly grey breast sides; from 
<tp:taxon-name>
batjanensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(Bacan Island) in its lemon-yellow belly lacking a strong olive suffusion; and from 
dumasi
(Seram and Buru) in its much less brown-colored upperparts. In many aspects, the new taxon is similar to the set of subspecies on Sulawesi (
riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow belly (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near-complete absence of yellow, respectively).
</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies shares many unique traits with the new subspecies from Taliabu 
sulanus
(see SM7), but differs significantly in its darker chestnut crown and its less reddish overall appearance, largely lacking a rufescent suffusion to the breast and flanks, and showing much less rufescent on the auriculars; its flanks are also much colder olive-washed (versus warmly rufescent-washed), and the upperparts and especially upper wings are colder bronze-olive. On live birds, the legs are much darker and less intensely colorful than those of birds from Taliabu.

FER and Filip Verbelen first encountered and documented the new subspecies during a visit to the highlands of western Peleng between 22-31 March 2009 (

Typical of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers, this new taxon is restricted to forest edge situations, treefall gaps and bamboo thickets in montane forest on the island of Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago. During our combined visits to the island (

19
, 
49

), we recorded this new taxon from 750m to the highest point at over 1000m elevation. It may, therefore, not range as low as the new taxon from neighboring Taliabu, although future fieldwork may well produce lower elevational records. Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago is unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new subspecies. Despite its very small range, its predilection for disturbed forest situations probably means that it is not particularly negatively affected by the current degradation that is impacting most highland forests of western Peleng.

Taxonomic rationale (combined for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus sulanus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
P. c. relictus
)


</p>
            <p>
The Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
was previously thought to be an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird and then called Mountain Tailorbird. We here acknowledge the distant relationship to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbirds (
13 1
) and therefore follow the recent trend of calling members of this species ‘leaftoilers’ rather than tailorbirds [e.g. (

57

)], a fitting translation from their re- instated scientific genus name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
. As for the species name 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, we follow the recently proposed emendation (

6

) of the original spelling of the name (‘ 
cuculatus’
) on the basis of information in the original description showing that the name was meant to refer to the birds’ hooded appearance (from Latin cucullus – hood).
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: The new subspecies 
sulanus
from Taliabu is arguably one of the most distinctly-colored, if not the single most distinctly-colored subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(see Diagnosis) and is therefore well-deserving of subspecies status. Its reddish-suffused anterior body renders it instantly recognizable among any series of specimens. Although not as unique in morphology, we also describe 
relictus
from Peleng at the subspecific level mainly on the basis of its distinct coloration. In plumage distinctness, 
relictus
far exceeds several other previously recognized subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, such as 
P. c. cinereicollis
.
</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic evidence
: We have been unsuccessful in procuring a sufficiently large sample set of song recordings of the two new subspecies, precluding rigorous bioacoustic analysis. However, we note that the songs given by these two subspecies in the field did not strike us as very different from the songs of other subspecies we are familiar with. Song playback with recordings from several other islands elicited a ready response at least in 
P. c. relictus
. Based on our bioacoustic experience with Indonesian passerines, we do not have the impression that song differences of the two new subspecies would warrant anything but a subspecific treatment at the present time.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic evidence
: We created a set of ~8,500 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment of over 2 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase intron 2 (ND2) sequences, to investigate levels of differentiation among 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in a separate Methods paragraph below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three subspecies (
P. c. stentor
from eastern Sulawesi, 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng and 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population- genomic space (

). The main genomic division according to a PCA based on ~8,500 SNPs occurred between 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu versus the other two subspecies (PC1 in 

). In contrast to the leaf-warbler analysis (see SM6), this main genomic division among leaftoilers was also supported by the mitochondrial tree and the genomic ‘species tree’ (

), consistently placing 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng close to 
P. c. stentor
from Sulawesi, although the concatenated tree built from genome-wide loci was in conflict, placing 
P. c. relictus
closer to 
P. c. sulanus
. Coincidentally, the majority tree with a basal placement of 
sulanus
(topology 1 in 

) is also the arrangement that would be supported by the extraordinarily divergent plumage of 
sulanus
, making it unique among all leaftoiler subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
Pairwise divergences between the subspecies (as determined by ND2 distances) were relatively low (0.3-1.7%; 

), at levels generally accepted to be below the species threshold for birds [(~2-3%; (
100, 10 1
)], consistent with the current proposed subspecies status. These ND2 divergences further supported the majority tree (topology 1 in 

) by consistently rendering 
P. c. sulanus
as the most deeply diverged subspecies (up to ~1.7%), whereas 
P. c. relictus
and 
P. c. stentor
emerged as only 0.3% diverged.
</p>
            <p>
In summary, mitochondrial sequence analysis, PCA of genome-wide SNPs and ‘species-tree’ analysis all agree in placing 
P. c. sulanus
basal to the other two subspecies, an arrangement supported by its distinct plumage. Therefore, we have no reason to suspect bias in the mitochondrial divergence depth (unlike in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
, see SM6), which supports our bioacoustic assessment that both 
relictus
and 
sulanus
are at the subspecies level. Future studies of the uniquely colored 
P. c. sulanus
may yet challenge this assessment.
</p>
            <p>
Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted genomic DNA of all tissue material available for 
P. c. sulanus
(n=5) and 
P. c. relictus
(n=2), along with two samples of 
P. c. stentor
that we had independently collected on Mt Tumpu on the adjacent eastern Sulawesi peninsula (

19

). Tissue of a single individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cettia parens
</tp:taxon-name>
from Makira in the Solomon Islands, provided by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was also extracted to serve as an outgroup in phylogenomic rooting. Laboratory and analytical protocols followed our procedures outlined in SM6 (under 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
), utilizing the same reference genome (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
), but using a minimum stack depth of 5 in STACKS 1.34 and a minimum required locus coverage of 5 in pyRAD due to differences in sequencing quality. The final filtered dataset for the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers totaled 8,515 SNPs and the final concatenated read supermatrix was 2,002,726 bp long, generated from 13,194 separate loci. For mitochondrial analysis, we sequenced ND2 using the primers L5219Met and H6313Trp (
13 2
) with 35 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 50-53°C, but otherwise following the procedures as outlined in SM6. The final ND2 alignment for the leaftoilers was 1,015bp long, indel-free and fully translatable. All DNA data has been deposited with Genbank at accession number PRJNA566263 and 
MN518850

Hartert, 1920 (‘extremely neglected’) from Selayar Island, were based on the impression that the description of these birds had escaped the attention of researchers for too long. The presently described taxon, only discovered in the 21

century, fulfils that criterion even more adequately, so we take pleasure in naming it 
omississimus
(‘the most neglected’), superlative of ‘omissus’.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The immature plumage remains undocumented. The only two male specimens known to exist (holotype and MZB.Ornit.34.488) show minimal plumage variation, the only difference perhaps being the latter specimen’s slightly brighter, more brilliant rump and darker, more blackish tarsus and claws in life.</p>
            <p>As compared to males, the three female specimens have a duller blue supercilium (but still discernible), lack a black chin, have prominent rufous spectacles over a narrow blackish stripe through the cere, the rufous continuing to the lower sides of the face where it is finely speckled dark (in two of three females the speckling continues to the throat sides), and have much less dark blackish-blue auriculars, contrasting less with the rufous throat. The female’s upperparts are less brilliant blue. One of the three female specimens is slightly paler on the tarsus and claws.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new subspecies was first reported by Indrawan et al. (
13 3
), who documented the sighting of a female on 15 May 2001 and a male on 29 July 2001 at 50-100m elevation around Benteng on the main island of Togian, and pointed out that this new population may be an undescribed subspecies. Following their footsteps, Filip Verbelen (pers. comm.) made the first sound recordings of the new population in December 2008 when studying a few individuals on Kadidiri, a tiny forested tourist resort island off the coast of Togian measuring ~4km in length and less than 1km in width. A few days later, F. Verbelen moved to Batudaka, one of the three main islands of the archipelago, where he found additional individuals in coastal forest near the capital town of Wakai. FER visited Batudaka Island from 23-27 April 2009 and observed this new population. On our collecting trip, we visited Batudaka from 24-28 Dec 2013 and found this taxon to be common in the forests outside the capital town of Wakai, collecting the present material in the process (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>The new subspecies is known from the Togian Archipelago in the Gulf of Tomini, a satellite group of islands between the northern and eastern peninsulas of Sulawesi. More specifically, to the best of our knowledge the new subspecies has so far been found on the two main islands of Togian and Batudaka, as well as on the tiny islet of Kadidiri off Togian, where it is common in remnant forest and edge from near sea level to at least ~200m elevation. However, it is likely that the birds occur up to the highest elevations at ~430m on these islands. More field research is required to map this subspecies’ occurrence on other islands in this archipelago. Its presence on some of the larger, forest-covered islands in close proximity to Batudaka and Togian, such as Talatakoh, Waleakodi and Waleabahi, is virtually guaranteed, given its occurrence on tiny Kadidiri. However, its presence on slightly more distant islands, such as Puah (at ~18km from the main archipelago) and Unauna (at ~28km from the main archipelago) is less certain, although these latter islands are connected to the main archipelago by shallow sea-beds not exceeding 120m depth, indicating that they would have been connected with one another during glacial sea level recessions.</p>
            <p>
On the main island of Sulawesi, the newly described 
omississimus
is replaced by the nominate taxon 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Unusually, however, the nominate form on Sulawesi is a hill and montane forest denizen, occurring from 500-2300m elevation and shunning lowland forest habitats in stark contrast to the new subspecies.
</p>
            <p>The new subspecies appears to be moderately tolerant to habitat disturbance where small-scale timber extraction leads to a secondarization of primary forest. However, the taxon disappears where forest is converted into agricultural land. Although Togian’s forests are quickly dwindling, with most remnants by now secondary and restricted to inland locations away from the coast, far more than half of the islands should still be suitable for the new taxon, making it safe for the time being.</p>

            <p>
Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The proposed English name of this new taxon follows a recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] to call members of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
‘jungle-flycatchers’ rather than ‘blue-flycatchers’ because molecular data (
13 4
) and bioacoustic considerations (
57, 7 4
) strongly suggest a merger of many members of the previously recognized jungle-flycatcher genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinomyias
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Given that numerous species in the resultant genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
are no longer blue but entirely brown, the name ‘blue-flycatcher’, while formerly appropriate, is no longer suitable for this genus.
</p>
            <p>
Although distinguishable from other subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
in terms of plumage characters (see Diagnosis), 
omississimus
is quite similar to them in general coloration. At any rate, plumage coloration is not an ideal taxonomic indicator in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
jungle-flycatchers, many of which boast a highly conserved male plumage sporting blue upperparts and reddish underparts. Other characters, such as bioacoustic and genetic ones, may be more conducive to guiding taxonomic decision-making in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
We recently published a bioacoustic comparison on the basis of six vocal parameters among members of the greater 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, showing that the song of the newly described 
omississimus
from Togian exhibits considerable vocal overlap with the songs of all three analyzed subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
, while distinctly differing from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. kalaoensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[see 

in (
7 4
)]. This vocal evidence along with Togian’s proximity to Sulawesi suggest a placement of 
omississimus
as a subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Based on a lack of deep differentiation in both bioacoustic and genetic evidence, we propose to classify this new taxon at the subspecies level. Upon first discovery in the field, we were generally impressed by its lowland forest occurrence, which stands in contrast to the montane forest requirements of the nominate subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi. This pronounced difference in habitat preference was given much weight in supporting species- level recognition of the new Togian population in a recently published field guide to the region (

57

). However, given Gwee et al.’s (
7 4
) newly published data, the latter treatment has ultimately proved erroneous.

in its lack of solid white or rufous on the belly; its uniform dark-brown coloration in which only the underparts show a faint warm tinge; and its unmarked dark-brown vent. The new subspecies has a darker hood and breast than the above-mentioned taxa except for the intensely rufous-bellied 
fumidus
and perhaps 
hygroscopus
. It also differs from 
deningeri
from Seram in its paler, browner (less black) body color, with a darker non-contrasting hood, and differs from 
schlegelii
and 
sterlingi
(both from Timor) in its less olive overall coloration and lack of rufous belly and vent.
</p>
            <p>
Within Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely resembles the much larger and longer-winged 
versteegi
and 
papuensis
from Papua but is dark slaty-brown (versus black) in overall body color and has an unmarked vent. The lower underparts have more extensive and paler-cinnamon feather margins in the new subspecies versus narrower, more rufous feather margins in the Papuan forms.
</p>
            <p>
Among geographically more distant Island Thrush subspecies from outside of Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely approaches three taxa from the Solomon Islands (
bougainvillei, kulambangrae, sladeni)
and two taxa from the Bismarck Archipelago (
heinrothi, beehleri
), but lacks those subspecies’ blackish overall body color. It also superficially resembles 
nigrorum
from Negros (Philippines), but the latter subspecies’ lower belly grades into whitish on the vent while the new subspecies is uniformly dark on those parts. Furthermore, another Philippine subspecies, 
kelleri
from Mt Apo (Mindanao), is similar to the new subspecies but becomes darker brown towards the front of the head while the new subspecies has a nearly uniform head coloration becoming slightly paler on the forehead.

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The subspecies name, translated from Bahasa Indonesia “it likes the rain” (=suka hujan), refers to the circumstances surrounding the bird’s discovery. On FER’s first expedition to the highest parts of Taliabu (

48

), heavy persistent rain impeded bird observations, leading to a decision to abort the expedition ahead of schedule. On his premature descent, FER then spotted a hardy individual of the new thrush, perched in the pouring rain, leading him to change plans yet again and mount a subsequent second and eventually third expedition to these elevations in better weather. This latter third expedition then allowed for a more detailed documentation of Taliabu’s distinct novel montane avifauna (

19
, 
48

). The name 
sukahujan
is treated as an inalienable noun in apposition.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>All nine specimens procured resemble one another considerably in coloration. The greatest variation occurs in the tone of the lower breast and abdomen, which is intermediate in the holotype but ranges from all-drab brownish grey throughout with almost no warm edging (in MZB.Ornit.34.416) to more extensive cinnamon feather edging (in most adult females, especially MZB.Ornit.34.409), the latter leading to an overall warmer underparts impression. Females are variably slightly less slaty on upperparts and crown, and one adult individual (MZB.Ornit.34.416) of unknown sex has a male-like slaty tone on upperparts but a female- like crown color that is more suffused with dull brown. Two juveniles (MZB.Ornit.34.410; MZB.Ornit.34.417) exhibit noticeable mottling on their mantle and underparts coloration, caused by dark brownish-black feather margins contrasting against the paler (on underparts sometimes warm cinnamon) feather centers.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new taxon was first discovered on 8 and 9 April 2009 by FER near its type locality on the occasion of a hike to the highest elevations on Taliabu that was cut short by heavy rainfall. Subsequent sightings on 14 and 15 April 2009 were made in the same area on the occasion of a return visit (

48

). We found this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected the type along with the accompanying specimens.

<tp:taxon-name>
T. poliocephalus

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
With approximately 50 subspecies, the Island Thrush 
<tp:taxon-name>
Turdus poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
is arguably the most polytypic bird species on Earth (
13 5
). Attempts to separate this variable species complex into smaller species-level lineages [e.g. (
13 6
)] have been called into question by genetic data showing that plumage characters are not a good predictor of close relationships in this complex (
13 7
). Hence, modern sources generally continue to unite all or most subspecies into one polytypic species. Not unlike some Philippine subspecies previously under study (
13 7
), the new subspecies from Taliabu is phenotypically extremely different from neighboring forms but more closely resembles certain geographically distant subspecies. It is presently best accommodated at the subspecies level. Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic inquiries are needed in the future to assess whether any internal species limits must be drawn within the complex. Such future analyses may well elevate the Taliabu Island Thrush to species level. However, such analyses are currently hampered by a lack of crucial comparative DNA material.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Forehead to crown and nape dark slaty blue (2.5PB 2/2) with slightly scaly appearance generated through narrow black feather centres; the same color, but without the scaly appearance, then continues through mantle and scapulars to rump. A white supercilium starts above the centre of the eye and ends just shy of the bill base, becoming narrower towards the front. A black facial patch centred in the loral region and below the supercilium to the chin (with narrow rows of black feathers above the bill base) grades into dark slaty blue coloration (2.5PB 1.5/2) towards the auriculars and the malar and moustachial regions, merging with the nape and mantle. Upperwing coverts largely concolorous with crown, with vestiges of an extremely indistinct brighter carpal patch visible with difficulty on this specimen. Remiges are dark slaty brown (10YR 2.5/1), the larger primaries with warmer, paler outer edging (10YR 4/2). Breast intensely rufous (7.5YR 7/12), becoming slightly paler on throat and upper flanks, and becoming pale cinnamon-whitish on belly and lower flanks (7.5YR 9/4), and eventually off-white on undertail coverts. Tail dull black on upper side, blackish-grey (N2) on underside, with indistinct white base to outermost rectrices. Iris dark-brown; legs light-pink; black bill with pinkish gape flange on live bird.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
An unequivocal member of the Snowy-browed Flycatcher 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ficedula hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
, and one of its most easterly outposts, with minor plumage distinctions in the male and major plumage distinctions in the female, a combination of which conclusively demarcates this new taxon from other subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
The male subtly differs from adjacent insular subspecies to the south and to the west, namely from the two Sulawesi subspecies (
jugosae, annalisa
), from 
sumatrana
(Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo), from 
vulcani
(Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores), and from 
alifura
(Buru), in the reduction of white patches at the base of the outer tail feathers, and in the slightly less extensive rufous underparts, replaced on the belly by pale cinnamon- whitish. In contrast, males of the only subspecies to the east and north (
pallidipectus
from Bacan Island) are markedly paler on the underparts than the males of this new subspecies, and have more contrastingly olive flanks. The white supercilium in males of the new subspecies is narrower than that of at least 
sumatrana, vulcani
, and 
alifura
.
</p>
            <p>
The female is highly distinct from most subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
in her bluish (versus olive, brown or grey-brown) upperparts coloration, extensive cold-brown mottling on breast (versus little to none), and a washed-out face pattern ghosting that of the male, with a whiter (versus rufous) brow. The only other subspecies that equals female 
F. h. betinabiru
in her bluish tinge to the upperparts is 
alifura
from adjacent Buru, in which the back color is ever so slightly brighter-blue. Compared to the new subspecies, the female of 
alifura
exhibits a more rufous (less white) eye brow, and brighter and more extensive rufous underparts with less brown mottling.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>
Only adult specimens have been procured, although a photo of a 
pullus
near the nest suggests an early juvenile plumage similar to other subspecies. Among adults, tarsus color as recorded in the field on live birds appears to vary individually from light-pink to pinkish-horn.
</p>
            <p>There is minor variation among the nine adult male specimens procured in the lower extent of the rufous breast, the intensity of the cinnamon wash to the belly, thickness of the supercilium and the extent of vestigial white patches on the basal outer rectrices. There is minor variation among the five adult female specimens in the intensity of brown mottling on the underparts, width and paleness of the supercilium and the presence or absence of a slight brownish tinge to the lowermost mantle portion.</p>

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies of Snowy-browed Flycatcher was first encountered by the University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 (
64, 9 8
). Members of that survey found the new taxon predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m) and suggested that it may be a novel subspecies. FER then saw one adult male at 1100m during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu on 5 April 2009 (

48

). We returned to this general area between 6-16 December 2013, where we found 
betinabiru
as one of the most common constituents of the forest interior understorey avifauna and collected the type and accompanying individuals at ~1300m (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
Subspecies 
betinabiru
is currently only known from the understorey of dense montane forest in the highlands of Taliabu at above 800m elevation (
19, 48, 64, 9 8
). Extensive logging has occurred across the highlands of Taliabu, with some parts of the mountains additionally affected by large-scale forest fires (see Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler account in SM3; 

). As an understory inhabitant, 
betinabiru
would be particularly susceptible to this kind of habitat degradation and is therefore probably declining. Nevertheless, it remains extremely common where good habitat persists, as indicated by our high mistnet capture rates (

19

).
</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, Snowy-browed Flycatchers have not been detected on the two other main islands of the Sula Archipelago, although their occurrence is possible at least on Mangole, which rises to 1,127m, while very unlikely on Sanana, which does not rise taller than ~600m. If confirmed on Mangole, it is likely that the local population would refer to the same subspecies 
betinabiru
.
</p>
            <p>
On the adjacent Banggai Archipelago, a single Snowy-browed Flycatcher was recorded once in April 2009 at 800-900m on the tallest island of Peleng (

49

). To the best of our knowledge, there have not been subsequent records from this island despite extensive fieldwork. In the absence of photos or closer details about the single Peleng record, it is impossible to ascertain whether the Peleng population is ascribable to 
betinabiru
, to one of the two Sulawesi races (
annalisa, jugosae
) or to a novel unnamed subspecies.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We describe this new taxon on the basis of its characteristic plumage (especially in females). These plumage distinctions certainly warrant a description at the subspecific level as they exceed those of several more poorly marked subspecies within this complex (e.g. 
annalisa
[Stresemann, 1931], which only subtly differs from 
jugosae
[Riley, 1921]). Bioacoustic variation in this species complex is poorly explored, but the high-pitched courtship vocalization of the new subspecies superficially resembles that of many other subspecies, and playback of songs from other subspecies elicits a ready response from members of this population. Genetic differences between the new taxon and other subspecies remain unexplored.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Crown, nape, ear coverts and neck sides are mid-brown (7.5YR 4/2), with a distinct cinnamon-chestnut forehead extending over eye (7.5YR 4/8). Black rictal bristles. Nape color slowly grading into warmer cinnamon-rufous (2.5YR 4/10) across mantle, scapulars and rump to the basal 60% portion of tail. The outer remiges are mostly dark dusky-brown (7.5YR 2/1), becoming paler and more olive-brown (7.5YR 4/2) towards the inner remiges. All remiges have narrow but intense rufous outer edging concolorous with rump and lower back color. The wing coverts are almost identical to the inner remiges in color, with an increasing intensity and width of bright-rufous feather tipping towards the median and lesser coverts. The distal 40% of the tail is greyish-black (N2), with paler rufous tips (5YR 5/6) on the underside only. Chin and throat form a white triangle delimited below by a conspicuous large black breast patch. A diffuse band of grey coloration (N5) with a black scaly appearance created by black feathers with narrow grey edging demarcates the black breast patch on its lower side. The belly is pale buff (7.5YR 9/8), grading into a richer, fuller hue on the flanks and undertail coverts (7.5YR 5/6). The iris is dark-brown, the bill black with a pinkish base to the lower mandible, and the tarsus on the live bird was described as pinkish- horn.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A mid-sized, rufous-toned 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura
</tp:taxon-name>
typical of a radiation of fantails distributed throughout Australasia. It most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
(

57

), and constitutes the third member of this radiation. Its plumage distinctions from the other two species are subtle yet consistent. However, the most characteristic distinction is its unique courtship vocalization (
7 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, the new species differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Sula Islands in its much narrower, less distinct rufous tips to the underside of the rectrices, in its more distinct black scaling below the black breast patch, and in its more strongly cinnamon-buff (less white) central underparts. The new species’ throat is cleaner white, less interspersed with dusky tips to the feathers.
</p>
            <p>
The new species differs from all three subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi in its wider black portion of the tail and its warmer brown crown and upper mantle. When compared to the geographically most closely adjacent subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni toradja
</tp:taxon-name>
from eastern and central Sulawesi, the new species additionally differs in its cleaner white throat and slightly less conspicuous scaling below the black breast patch, while it is additionally distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
of the Lompobattang Massif in South Sulawesi by its blacker breast patch and by the richer chestnut (less cinnamon) coloration of its brighter body parts (such as supercilium, rear upperparts, flanks and vent).

Etymology

</p>
            <p>The new species’ epithet is in honor of the late Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie (deceased 11 Sep 2019), the third president of the Republic of Indonesia. President Habibie was known as a keen environmentalist and contributed greatly to the science and conservation of nature in Indonesia.</p>

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The only three specimens (all adult; one female, two males) exhibit limited variation in terms of extent of breast patch and black mottling below breast patch that may have been caused by the preparation of the specimens.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new species has doubtless been known to the local inhabitants of Peleng Island for a long time. Mochamad Indrawan was presumably the first outside ornithologist to see this new bird when encountering a dead individual during his work on Peleng in the mid-2000s and re- encountering the species in the wild on several undated occasions (

49

). During a field trip between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently observed the species near the type locality (

49

), where we returned from 18-23 Dec 2013 to collect the type and the accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new species is restricted to montane forest on the island of Peleng, the largest landmass in the Banggai Archipelago, at elevations not lower than 750m (

19
, 
49

) (

). Over two longer visits to the highlands of Peleng, we found that the species becomes gradually more common towards higher elevations before it seems to drop out somewhere slightly below the tallest peak on Peleng at 1,022m. The new species is replaced on Sulawesi to the west by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
, and on the Sula Archipelago to the east by 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Its occurrence on other islands of the Banggai Archipelago is highly unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
must be considered threatened given the small extent of its occurrence and the continuing loss of its habitat. Only 25,071 ha of land on Peleng fall above the approximate 750m elevational cutoff, most of it formerly constituting a single contiguous block of highland forest (

). However, our own observations in combination with satellite imagery indicate extensive forest loss to small-scale agriculture and logging by burgeoning village communities. Google Earth’s present coverage of the area is mixed, with large swathes covered by insufficient or outdated (e.g., 2004) imagery. However, given current satellite coverage, a conservative estimate is that 9,987 ha (~40%) from within the elevational range of

have either been completely deforested or constitute young regrowth or unviable forest fragments surrounded by clearings. This would leave only 15,084 ha of more or less undisturbed primary or older secondary forest. Recent observations indicate, however, that this extent of forest loss is probably an underestimate. After the first discovery of this species and a number of other new bird taxa on Peleng (

49

), the island became a destination for an average of 1-3 international adventure and birdwatching tour groups per year, which considerably helped spur the local economy of the village near the type locality (name withheld). While this sort of ecotourism has a positive impact on the natural environment in many reported cases, on Peleng the sudden influx of tourist dollars led to observations of increased logging and expansion of infrastructure, prompting the rapid destruction of forest at the original type locality over the last five years. In the near future, it will be of paramount importance for the survival of Peleng’s unique montane fauna to find ways in which the influx of eco-tourism dollars can create incentives for conservation.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
Based on its plumage coloration, the new species is clearly a member of the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, hitherto known from Sulawesi and the Sula Archipelago (

57

). The discovery of a new constituent of this radiation on the Banggai Archipelago closes the geographic gap between Sulawesi and Sula. Most previous taxonomic treatises (e.g. 
6 1, 7 5
) have regarded all members of this radiation as conspecific, and indeed plumage differences are relatively minor and have long been interpreted as consistent with a subspecific treatment. However, recent research into patterns of bioacoustic and genomic differentiation among rusty-bellied fantails from Sulawesi, Sula and Banggai has produced strong evidence in favor of species level treatment of all three island populations (
7 2
).

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="biology_ecology">
            <p>
Vocalizations
: Bioacoustically, the courtship vocalization (=song) of the new species from Peleng is the most distinct of any member of the radiation. A detailed characterization of this song has been published elsewhere (

49

). In fact, when we first found the species in the field, the bird stood out through its unusual, simple descending song that lacks the typical complex tinkling quality of its congeners (

49

). Quantitative bioacoustic comparisons revealed that the unusual vocal features of the new Peleng species have led to an acoustic leapfrog pattern in rusty-bellied fantails in which the two terminal (=easternmost and westernmost) species (i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) are more similar to each other in courtship vocalizations but are geographically divided by the new species with its unusual song (
7 2
). The great vocal distinctness of the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
is surprising because it belies its geographic proximity to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
(Sulawesi)
</tp:taxon-name>
across a combined lowland and sea gap of less than 40km and its frequent land connection to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
(Taliabu)
</tp:taxon-name>
across Pleistocene land bridges during times of global cooling (

49

). Vocal behavior is known to be an important feature in species cohesion and reproductive isolation in songbirds (
7 6, 77
), and has been shown to be more important as an indicator of species limits than plumage traits in some passerine lineages (

78

). Therefore, recent authors have accepted the unmistakable vocal uniqueness of the new Peleng fantail as an indication of its status as an undescribed new species (
57, 7 2
).

Genomic data
: In a previously published analysis (
7 2
), we conducted a comparison of&gt;11,000 genome-wide markers with a complete representation among 16 individuals spanning all three species within the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. In this analysis, the new species from Peleng emerged as most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (both subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
toradja
) and less closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sula. This phylogenomic result is significant considering that – among all pairwise vocal comparisons – the greatest bioacoustic differentiation is found between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and the new species, with strong vocal distinctions in both non-courtship vocalizations and courtship songs (
7 2
). Therefore, the relatively shallowest genomic differentiation among the three island populations corresponds to the deepest bioacoustic divergence.
</p>
            <p>
Although the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
emerged as most closely related within the radiation, comparisons of genome-wide data allow for the designation of both taxa as independent species: the basal split between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other taxa is mainly based on a genomic signal contained in ~20% of the genetic variance across study loci, whereas the second most dominant genomic signature – contained in ~14% of the genetic variance across markers – predominantly represents the deep divergence between the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
[

in (
7 2
)]. The presence of a significant proportion of genomic locus cohorts displaying deep differentiation between the new species and either of its two neighbors was in agreement with gene flow analyses (‘ABBA-BABA tests’) that pointed to a history of rare introgression between the new species and its neighbors (
7 2
), perhaps during episodes of unusual climate forcing dispersal between islands. Such secondary introgression is not unusual among congeneric bird species (

79

) and is not in conflict with species level treatment.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>
The entire crown from forehead to nape is rich earthen-brown (7.5YR 3/3) with slightly darker feather margins creating a scalloped appearance. A thin off-white supercilium is pronounced from bill base to just behind eye, from where it slowly tapers out. Lores are dark brownish-black (2.5Y 1.5/1). Ear coverts are of a medium earthen-brown tone (5YR 3/1) with fine pale shaft streaks giving a grizzled appearance, grading into a more greyish-brown tone (10YR 6/1) in the moustachial and malar region. The mantle and scapulars down to the uppertail coverts are largely concolorous with the crown but lack the scalloping created by darker feather margins. The remiges are mostly a rich cold dark-brown (2.5YR 2/1) but have warmer outer webs concolorous with mantle. The upperwing coverts are similarly two-toned, being mostly concolorous with mantle but some showing darker outer webs concolorous with most of remiges. As typical for the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
, the rectrices are narrow and dark- brown, very close in color to the remiges (2.5YR 2/1). The tail feathers are mostly worn, although one in the centre appears to be a new replacement.
</p>
            <p>The white chin and throat are quite sharply demarcated from the face. The lower throat and upper breast, still white, are interspersed with fine dusky speckling increasing towards the breast and lower throat sides where the color grades into a solid mid-grey (N5) with only few inconspicuous dusky speckles. The grey breast color then grades into a tawny- ochraceous belly color (7.5YR 4/6), first through tracts of grey feathers which have warm- ochraceous edging, then through tracts of largely ochraceous feathers that still have a grey feather centre, eventually to all-ochraceous feathers. The belly color becomes darker and richer on the undertail coverts and flanks (7.5YR 3/4).</p>
            <p>The bill is black with an inconspicuous paler tip. The gape on the live bird was slightly enlarged light yellow. The iris is dark brown. The tarsus and toes were described on the live bird as maroon-horn with paler, more yellowish toepads.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A rich dark-brown forest warbler typical of the montane resident 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. As is usual across this cryptic genus, the new taxon is most conspicuous not on the basis of its plumage but its vocalizations.
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, it is most similar in size and shape to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
of Sulawesi. However, in comparison to the new taxon, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
has less distinct speckling on the breast, has a more uniform crown that is less scalloped, paler and warmer brown upperparts, greyer underparts with brown mostly only on flanks, and has a less pointed, wider tail.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram differs in its less distinct central breast spotting, greyer (less whitish) supercilium, and more extensive grey on breast reaching further onto upper breast, neck sides and auriculars.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru differs in its much whiter breast, with off-white reaching onto mid-belly, whereas only the lower flanks and lower belly are warm-brown. Although the central breast of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
has a mid-grey tinge, its underparts are much paler than the new species’ fairly uniform grey lower breast, which grades into a fairly dark homogeneous warm-brown belly.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is quite different from the smaller 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. montis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Java. The latter is much paler cinnamon-brown on upperparts, crown and especially remiges and rectrices, and is uniformly buff-white below with extensive dark-brown speckling from chin to upper belly, lacking the new species’ grey tones on the breast and dark warm-brown tones on the belly.

The name 
<tp:taxon-name>
portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
– past participle of Latin ‘portendere’ – roughly translates as “the predicted one” or “the foretold one” and relates to the unusual circumstances of discovery when FER first heard the new warbler and recognized it to be a novel species of

multiple days before a visual confirmation was obtained.

            <p>Currently only one adult specimen is available (i.e., the holotype), and photos of up to two more adults suggest that this is probably a sexually monomorphic species with limited plumage variation.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
FER was the first person to discover 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on 9 April 2009 near its type locality when he heard an unmistakable insect-like sound that he attributed to a hitherto unnamed taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
grasshopper-warbler. Having been exposed to the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on a visit to Sulawesi only two weeks prior, and having had previous field experience with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru and Seram, respectively (
8 0
), FER was aware that the song of this population – albeit superficially reminiscent of the others – is distinct at the species level. Even so, because of the retiring nature of this bird and ill-timed heavy rain, it took FER another two hiking expeditions to the highlands of Taliabu to finally confirm on 15 April 2009 that this song was indeed uttered by what he perceived as an “unusually dark” individual of grasshopper-warbler (

48

). We encountered this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected a single specimen, now the holotype.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is presumably restricted to montane forest at the highest elevations of the island of Taliabu (

19
, 
48

) (

). All our records are from elevations above 1,050m on the more mountainous western half of the island of Taliabu, which reaches its highest altitude of ~1,415m at an unnamed peak near our collection locality (

). The new species inhabits a peculiar type of dwarf montane forest typical of these elevations.
</p>
            <p>
The occurrence of the new species on neighboring islands is highly doubtful. Of the three major islands that form the Sula archipelago, Taliabu is the largest and tallest. The smallest main island, Sanana, barely reaches above 600m elevation. The highest elevation on its larger neighbor Mangole is 1,127m – theoretically within the elevational range of this grasshopper-warbler – but the area of land above 1,050m on Mangole is only ~36 ha, which is too small an area to allow for the survival of a highly montane bird species throughout evolutionary time scales. On the neighboring Banggai archipelago, the situation is similar: the only island high enough to allow for the theoretical possibility of grasshopper-warbler breeding occurrence is Peleng (highest elevation ~1,022m), but extensive fieldwork around this highest area has not revealed the presence of any resident grasshopper-warblers (

19
, 
49

).
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
must be a rare bird: Taliabu’s area above 1,050m amounts to ~16,690 ha of formerly forested land in the interior of the island’s western half, over 97% of which forms one contiguous block (

). However, satellite imagery predominantly from 2004 indicates that a total of ~1,023 ha (~6.1%) of this area had been affected by logging operations that have degraded the forest and removed its undercover, presumably rendering the affected areas unsuitable, or nearly so, for the grasshopper-warbler. In the one-and-a-half decades since the satellite images were obtained, extensive additional logging is likely to have occurred. Another 940 ha (~5.6%) of the area above 1,050m have succumbed to a series of catastrophic forest fires in 1982 and 1983, and now constitute open grassland habitat unsuitable for this warbler (

). Our surveys showed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
does not occur in the extensive recently generated grasslands in the highlands of Taliabu (

48

). This leaves 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
with less than 15,000 ha of suitable habitat, an area likely to further diminish in size with ongoing habitat destruction and the impacts of global warming leading to an upward elevational shift of habitat zones.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We include this new taxon within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
following the phylogenetic demonstration that the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bradypterus
</tp:taxon-name>
(previously used for this Southeast Asian clade of warblers) is restricted to Africa (
8 1, 8 2
). Its inclusion within 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
is the reason why we follow the recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] of using the English moniker ‘grasshopper-warbler’ rather than the term ‘bush-warbler’, which is more appropriately reserved for members of a radiation in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Cettiidae</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
is renowned for its cryptic and conservative coloration that has confounded plumage-based classifications for decades and led to delays in the recognition of species-level taxa until bioacoustic and molecular methods have been applied (
8 3, 8 4
). In Wallacea, members of a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from Sulawesi and the Moluccas were previously united into a single polytypic species 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
(
6 1, 7 5
), but have recently been divided into three constituent island species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru, on the basis of their strikingly different songs (

57

). Our new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is geographically surrounded by constituents of this radiation and is a member of it both on the basis of morphological characters (see Diagnosis) and bioacoustic ones.
</p>
            <p>
Although plumage distinctions are not as important in the genus, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by comparatively unique, dark-brown upperparts that stand in contrast to the generally paler and warmer-brown upperparts of neighboring species. However, we mainly attribute species status to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on the basis of its unique song and genetic differentiation. We here provide an excerpt of ongoing analyses as relating to the bioacoustic and mitogenomic differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from neighboring species.

Bioacoustic evidence
: A total of 41 suitable, high-quality, homologous 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
song recordings from the field were gathered for analysis from various sources, encompassing all three previous species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation plus the new species. These recordings were measured for 11 suitable bioacoustic parameters, and resultant measurements were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and a conservative vocal diagnosability criterion (

85

), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Further details regarding all analyzed recordings, such as GPS locations, dates, times, and names of recordists, are listed in table S3, while more details on bioacoustic methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
Based on the Isler Criterion, eight out of eleven song parameters measured were diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and two other taxa: 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (table S4). Four out of eleven parameters were Isler-diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (table S4). The ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) can be adopted to ascertain if the level of vocal divergence between these archipelagic taxa is comparable in magnitude to divergences across unequivocal species-level divisions. When comparing Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler song against that of the Friendly Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
, a geographically distant species from montane Borneo that has never been included in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, only two parameters emerged as Isler-diagnosable (table S4). Using this result as a yardstick for what constitutes species level vocal differentiation, the magnitude of vocal divergence between Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
on Seram, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
on Buru, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on Sulawesi is extremely high, indicating they all have diagnosably distinct vocalizations that are best reflected in species rank.
</p>
            <p>
Principal component analysis of the vocal measurements underscores the vocal distinctness of Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from the other three Wallacean species (

). A cumulative proportion of variance of 73.3% is accounted for in the first two principal components, suggesting a strong vocal differentiation between Taliabu and the remaining taxa (

).
</p>
            <p>
Mitogenomic evidence
: Using whole-genome sequencing and laboratory approaches for the use of ancient DNA, we created an alignment of whole-mitochondrial sequences spanning ~15,000 base pairs (bp) across 11 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals belonging to all four constituent island forms of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, and used three different phylogenetic tree-building methodologies to investigate relationships and levels of divergence. More details on the methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
All three phylogenetic trees produced indicated identical topologies with high bootstrap support (

), suggesting that the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is an independent lineage most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (mitogenomic divergence ~2%), and much more distantly related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (divergence ~4.8–5%) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (divergence ~7.7–8%). Mitogenomic divergences roughly correlate with those from the COI barcoding gene, although they do not have to be equal in magnitude.
</p>
            <p>
Integrating the vocal and mitogenomic evidence, it is clear that bioacoustic differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, the two species which emerged most closely related on the mitogenomic tree (

), far exceed those between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and a geographically distant species (
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
) that has never been closely associated with the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. Our combined evidence therefore supports the treatment of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
as a well-diverged small-insular endemic species.

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic sampling:
We obtained 41 homologous recordings, which were either recorded by us in the field, or privately sourced from avid field ornithologists (including Robert O. Hutchinson and Ross Gallardy), or collected from publicly accessible online databases, namely the Avian Vocalization Center (AVoCet at http://avocet. integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu), the Xeno-Canto Sound Library (www.xeno-canto.org), the Macaulay Sound Library (www.macaulaylibrary.org), and the Internet Bird Collection (www.hbw.com/ibc).
</p>
            <p>Although slight variation in recording quality exists in the equipment used, inspection and comparison of spectrograms from different devices showed that this variation is comparable to that amongst recordings made by one sole recordist using the same device. In addition, although there is some variability in background noise, spectrogram inspection suggested that measurements of vocalizations would not be affected. Measurements of the recordings were performed using the program Raven Pro Version 1.5 (Bioacoustics Research Program, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA) on its default settings. The following eleven parameters were chosen for bioacoustic analysis, with each parameter averaged over all the measurements across one recording:</p>

Bioacoustic analysis:
The vocal diagnosability criterion outlined by Isler et al. (
8 5
), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, was used to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Besides other oscine passerines (
73, 8 6
), this criterion has been employed as a bioacoustic species delimitation method across Asian birds such as owls (

58
, 
87

), pigeons (

50
, 
52
, 
88

), and nightjars (

89

). The Isler criterion has two parts which must be fulfilled in order to infer diagnosability. Firstly, the range of measurements of a parameter between two taxa must not exhibit overlap, and secondly, the data have to satisfy the following equation: 
xa
+ 
taSDa ≤xb–tbSDb,
where (
x
) refers to the respective means of measurements in taxon a and b, and 
ti
refers to the t-score at the 95th percentile of the t distribution for 
n-1
degrees of freedom. This is a stricter statistical test than the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (
8 5
) as it employs the standard deviation of the sample points instead of the taxon mean, allowing for the diagnosis of distinctions between taxa under more rigorous conditions. Successful Isler diagnosability is defined here as the presence of at least one vocally diagnostic parameter between taxa.

DNA extraction methods:
Fresh tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
was DNA- sequenced along with the following number of toepad scrapings of historical museum specimens: three of the Buru Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, three of the Seram Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and four of the Sulawesi Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
. All museum samples had been kindly contributed by the American Museum of Natural History (for voucher numbers, see 

and table S5). DNA extraction was carried out with the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extraction of the historic museum specimens’ toepad scrapings was conducted by trained personnel (CYG) in a room dedicated to ancient DNA extraction to preclude DNA contamination. The toepads were rinsed with water four times before extraction to ensure preservatives were removed, and DTT was added to facilitate digestion of keratin present in toepads. The concentrations of the DNA extracts were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay.
</p>
            <p>
DNA sequencing methods:
The holotype’s DNA extract was sheared into smaller fragments of ~250 base pairs (bp) using 13 cycles of 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off on a Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode, USA). Whole-genome library preparation for the holotype was carried out using a NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, USA) for Illumina according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the museum toepad extracts, the shearing step was omitted as the ancient DNA is already degraded and NEBNext FFPE DNA repair mix (New England Biolabs, USA) was added to each ancient DNA sample prior to library preparation to fix damage common to degraded DNA such as deamination, nicks and gaps. In addition, size selection of library preparation products was omitted for the toepad samples to reduce DNA loss from bead selection. A total of five PCR cycles were run on the holotype’s DNA extract and 12 PCR cycles on the toepads’ extracts. Whole-genome library preparation of toepad samples was carried out in a room with a PCR hood dedicated to ancient library preparation work. The concentrations and peak fragment sizes of the libraries were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay and an Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer (Agilent, USA), respectively. The peak fragment sizes of the historic museum samples and the fresh holotype (including adaptors and unique indexes) were ~230bp and ~380bp, respectively. All prepared libraries were sent to NovogeneAIT Genomics Singapore for Illumina sequencing using a HiSeq 4000 platform to produce 150bp paired-end reads.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial genome alignment
: Trimmomatic (version 0.33) (

90

) was used to remove adaptors and filter low quality reads (below 15 Phred quality score). We applied the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (version 0.7.15-r1140) (
9 1
) to align reads to a mitochondrial reference genome, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella pryeri
</tp:taxon-name>
(Genbank accession no.: NC_029151), with a minimum mapping quality score of 30. Samtools (version 1.9) (
9 2, 9 3
) was run to convert the SAM output files from the alignment to a BAM format for downstream analysis. Then Picard (version 2.18.21; http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) was employed to insert read groups and remove PCR duplicate artifacts. The BAM files were then imported into CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0.4 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com) for remapping to the same reference genome using the following mapping parameters: mismatch penalty of 1, insertion penalty of 1, and deletion penalty of 1. The reads were locally realigned at indel regions, and the consensus sequences were extracted at a minimum coverage threshold of 100. A mapping summary produced by Qualimap (version 2.2.1) (
9 4
) indicated that our mitochondrial genome coverage ranged between ~290–2920x for museum samples and ~6430x for the holotype (table S5). Sequences are deposited with GenBank at accession numbers 
MN597052
- 
MN597062
.
</p>
            <p>
Phylogenetic analysis
: The consensus sequences were exported in FASTA format and visually realigned in MEGA7 (

95

), producing a final whole-mitochondrial alignment of ~15,000bp. MEGA7 was used to construct a neighbor-joining tree based on uncorrected p- divergences and a maximum parsimony tree. Additionally, we ran raxmlGUI 1.5 beta (

96

) to construct a maximum likelihood tree using the GTRGAMMA model as specified by jModelTest (version 2.1.7) (

97

). All tree-building analyses were conducted with 10,000 bootstrap replicates. Pairwise uncorrected p-divergences across the mitogenomic alignment were calculated in MEGA7 with 10,000 bootstrap replicates.

            <p>Head and mantle down to uppertail coverts and to central belly are bright scarlet-red (7.5R 4/14) with subtle blackish suffusion owing to individual feathers having broad red distal half followed by black and then increasingly greyish basal half; jet-black narrow orbital ring and loral line. Upperwings, sides of mantle, scapulars and rectrices are matt black, with the remiges appearing slightly duskier black because of narrow olive edging to outer webs; underwing coverts and outer webs of the underside of remiges are whitish; a blackish-grey (N1.5) wedge extends from vent up to central belly.

The diagnosis refers to the adult male plumage only. Female 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals of the Wallacean radiation are generally very similar across species, and more research is needed to identify good distinguishing marks.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is an obvious, bright scarlet-and-black representative of the Wallacean grouping of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters that have often been united within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
complex (
6 1, 7 5
), but have been considered a radiation of independent species by more recent authors [e.g. (

57

)]. Within this radiation, the new species most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species has a more extensive and brighter red body and blacker wings, scapulars, and tail. Scarlet feathers in the new species are mostly black and grey at the base, with only the distal half scarlet, and with a sharp contrast between scarlet and black, lacking 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
’s narrow yellow bands in between the red and black portions of each individual feather that render the latter’s overall body more orange-tinted. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the red is not as extensive on the underparts, and the abdomen and vent are paler buff-white versus blackish-grey in the new species.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species is paler and greyer (not black) on vent and abdomen. It also has a smudgier scarlet body coloration (caused by the black and grey basal halves of individual feathers), with dark smudges especially pronounced on face and on breast sides, as compared to more uniform red underparts, head and mantle in 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
. Black lores in the new species are wider and not as clearly delimited as in 
<tp:taxon-name>

.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis

Etymology

</p>
            <p>We name this species after the village of Wahe (1.716°S, 124.843°E), which is the gateway to the highest elevations on Taliabu where it most commonly occurs. The species epithet is an indeclinable noun in apposition.</p>

Individual, age-related and sexual variation within taxon

</p>
            <p>
Two adult male specimens (holotype and 34.356) are virtually identical in coloration. Two additional male specimens (34.373 and 34.403), most likely immatures, are similar but have the scarlet body color replaced with a more rose-red hue (5R 4/14); they also do not exhibit any distinct olive margins of remiges. No comparative specimen material exists for adult females of the new species, which are generally similar among all regional 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species. Photos confirm that the female of the new species resembles other regional species (data not shown). One juvenile specimen (34.407) lacks red coloration and is generally drab grayish-brown (paler on underparts), becoming more intense earthen-brown on the mantle, rump and upperwing coverts, with the underside of remiges and rectrices mid-grey.

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
was first spotted by a University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 led by P.J. Davidson. Participants of this exploratory survey were probably the first ornithologists to visit the highlands of Taliabu between 600-800 m elevation (
64, 9 8
), where they found the new species predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m). FER then encountered the species commonly during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu between 4-18 April 2009 (

19
, 
48

), where we returned between 6-16 December 2013 to collect the holotype and accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has thus far only been found on the island of Taliabu within the Sula Archipelago. On Taliabu, we have recorded it from sea level to 1,300m (

19
, 
48

), and it presumably occurs further up all the way to the highest elevation at ~1,415m. The species inhabits forest canopy and edge habitat, and is a nectarivore and frugivore that has been photographed feeding at flowers (

48

). Akin to multiple other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species in Wallacea (

57

), the new species is seen far more often at higher elevations (roughly above ~800m) than in the lowlands. Davidson et al. (

64

), who first sighted this species, exclusively found it at higher elevations, mostly around ~800m, and we recorded it as “abundant” above 800m, whereas we have only had a handful of sightings in the lowlands. It is unknown to what extent elevational differences in abundance reflect the difficulty of detecting a canopy bird in tall lowland forest as compared to stunted montane forest. However, although detection difficulties may help mask its true abundance in the lowlands, we do not believe it is possible for the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
to be equally common across elevations given that other small canopy birds do not escape detection in the lowlands and are recorded commonly. In fact, the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
may even be a breeding endemic to montane elevations and only venture into the lowlands seasonally, following tree flowering and fruiting events. This potential seasonal displacement would explain why some expeditions have completely overlooked it in the lowlands while others have recorded it on occasion.
</p>
            <p>
It is contentious whether the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
is endemic to Taliabu, or also occurs on the other two main islands of the Sula Archipelago (Mangole and Sanana). The latter two have received even less ornithological attention than Taliabu, and to the best of our knowledge, the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has never been recorded there on recent ornithological expeditions (D. Yong, pers. comm.; J.A. Eaton, pers. comm.). Sanana is relatively low-lying (up to ~600m) and therefore likely to lack a number of Taliabu’s montane species. Mangole reaches its highest peak at 1,127m, but areas above 800m are confined to ~328 ha only, which gives it a comparatively small area of true montane forest. The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
’s level of dependence on vegetation at high elevations probably determines whether it would be capable of occurring on Mangole or even Sanana. Future fieldwork on those two islands will shed light on whether the new species occurs there or not.
</p>
            <p>
FER and Filip Verbelen first discovered a new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
population in the mountains of Peleng in the neighboring Banggai Archipelago during a visit between 23-30 March 2009 and recorded it as reasonably common at elevations between 700-900m in the western Peleng highlands (

49

). On our collecting expedition, we only had one aural encounter of this 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
on Peleng on 21 Dec 2013, indicating that the population might have been seasonally displaced or more retiring (

19

). However, photographic evidence from the 2009 visit indicates that the Peleng population has a plumage coloration that is very similar – if not identical – to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and quite different from 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
. As this Peleng population remains uncollected, future fieldwork will hopefully produce specimens allowing a determination whether there are differences between the Peleng birds and 
<tp:taxon-name>

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu is obviously a member of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, which used to be considered a single wide-ranging polytypic species for a long time (
6 1, 7 5
), but has now been divided into multiple monotypic island endemics by most recent authors on the basis of extensive plumage differences [e.g. (
57, 8 0, 99
)]. Within this radiation, its plumage most closely resembles that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, but is discrete from both of them in multiple characters (see Diagnosis). Its morphological differences from both 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
exceed those between other closely related species pairs within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. dammermani
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
(

73

). Therefore, its diagnosis here as a species level taxon rests on Mayr and Ashlock’s (

70

) yardstick approach, by which species status is conferred on the basis of divergences that exceed those of species pairs in which biologically important differences have been unequivocally demonstrated.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters have a wide vocal repertoire that is oftentimes problematic in the context of bioacoustic analysis (

73

). The Taliabu 
<tp:taxon-name>Myzomela</tp:taxon-name>
was hardly vocal during our encounters, and we do not consider vocalizations a fruitful taxonomic avenue in delimiting this new species from others. Instead, we have generated mitochondrial sequence data to further shed light on the new species’ taxonomic status.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial evidence
: Our mitochondrial tree analysis was based on sequences of the coding gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), comparing 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
to a great majority of members of the eastern and central Indonesian radiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters. Results indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
is most closely related to geographically adjacent species such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (

). Our analysis does not provide resolution on whether either 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
constitute the sister species to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
, and in fact, the latter two may well be sister to each other instead (

), rendering 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
a more basal species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from adjacent Buru is not represented in our mitochondrial dataset, and likely forms part of this group. Based on plumage coloration, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
is frequently considered to constitute the sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, and the two are sometimes merged under one species [e.g. (

99

)]. Therefore, we assume that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
– albeit closely related – will probably not emerge as the direct sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
in future analyses.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial ND2 divergence values between 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
and its two most closely related relatives (

<tp:taxon-name>M. elisabethae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chloroptera</tp:taxon-name>

) range between 3.5%–4.3% (

), well above the mitochondrial divergence threshold of 2-3% widely postulated in the literature (
10 0, 10 1
), providing additional support for species level recognition of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial analysis:
We extracted DNA from the breast muscle tissue of all our 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
material (n = 5), and from four independently collected 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
samples (

73

), using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. ND2 was then sequenced following Lim et al. (
10 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Using CodonCode Aligner version 8.0.2. (CodonCode, USA), our ND2 sequences were trimmed and assembled. These sequences of 991 bp length were then aligned in MEGA7 (
9 5
) with the ND2 sequences of 23 other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>The crown (from forehead to nape) is cold brown (2.5Y 2/2), delimited below by a narrow long white supercilium from bill base to napeside. Lores dark greyish brown (2.5Y 3/1) extending to just behind eye in the form of an eyestripe cutting through a broken white eye ring formed by small feathers peripheral to the eye. Black rictal bristles. Ear coverts and malar, facial and moustachial regions show white-and-dusky grizzling. Most of upperparts, including mantle, scapulars and rump, are mid-olive (5Y 4/4), while remiges are distinctly darker-olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). The white chin and throat are characterized by sporadic dusky speckles and lemon streaks increasing towards the lower throat, and grading into a fully lemon to sulphur yellow breast and belly (5Y 9/12). The yellow on the breast and belly has an olive-mottled appearance because of olive feather tips (5Y 4/4), especially pronounced towards the flanks, and white feather bases, especially pronounced towards the abdomen. The vent is solid lemon-yellow (5Y8/7). Iris dark-brown; bill black. Tarsus, toes and claws pinkish-grey with toepads paler yellowish.</p>

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The new species name is derived from “suara merdu” in Bahasa Indonesia, translating as “melodious voice”, referring to the pleasing vocalizations of this bird that FER heard hours before the first individual was seen, allowing for predictions prior to visual confirmation that this would be a new

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
During a visit to the highlands of Peleng between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently encountered this species at elevations between 700-900m (

49

). When hiking up to these elevations for the first time and hearing the melodious warble of this taxon in the distance, its superficial vocal resemblance to other members of the Wallacean 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation prompted FER to predict that this would be a new leaf-warbler taxon long before they laid their eyes on it. Once they first saw it, it was noticeable for its unusual behavior of frequently climbing along larger branches and trunks of trees in the manner of a treecreeper (
<tp:taxon-name>
Certhia
</tp:taxon-name>
). On our collecting expedition to Peleng between 18-23 Dec 2013, the species was less commonly encountered (

19

), probably because of seasonality.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new leaf-warbler is restricted to the highland forests of western Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago at elevations above 700m, reaching the highest island altitude above 1000m (

). Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago must be in serious doubt because only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, of which only 5 ha of land lie above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. Beyond the Banggai Archipelago,

Lemon ear coverts down to malar and moustachial regions (5Y 9/10) grizzled with dusky-olive feather edging, making for a mottled facial appearance. Upperparts from mantle and scapulars to rump are mid-olive (7.5Y 4/6). Remiges are distinctly darker- olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). Underparts from chin to vent are largely lemon to sulphur yellow, with white feather bases creating a more lemon-yellow hue on throat, breast and belly (7.5Y 8/8) and olive feather tips (5Y 4/4) generating a more olive- mottled appearance on flanks, while the undertail coverts are largely uniform lemon (5Y 9/12).</p>

<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
A University of East Anglia expedition by Davidson et al. (

64

) was the first to find a resident population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers on Taliabu, which they encountered commonly in montane forest and which they considered to represent an undescribed taxon. Rheindt (

48

) then studied this leaf warbler during his visit between 4-18 April 2009, and we found them again during our expedition between 6-16 Dec 2 013 and collected two (

19

).

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>
Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new warbler inhabits disturbed and undisturbed montane forest on Taliabu from 700m up to probably the highest elevations above 1,400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). It may also occur on the large neighboring island of Mangole, which rises to 1,127m and should harbor enough area of montane forest habitat above 700m to sustain a population. However, a lack of fieldwork in the mountains of Mangole means that there is no information available on its montane avifauna. The smallest main constituent of the Sula Archipelago, the densely populated island of Sanana, is unlikely to sustain any 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers as it barely reaches above 600m, which seems to be too low for this species. The species is replaced on the Banggai Archipelago by the newly described 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
(see SM5), while 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
replace it in various parts of Sulawesi. Given its more relaxed elevational requirements and its tolerance for disturbed habitat, this species is probably not as immediately endangered as some of the other montane Taliabu avifauna.

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
)


</p>
            <p>
The leaf-warbler genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
constitutes a large Old World radiation of small passerines that is exceptionally well-studied in phylogenetic terms (
10 6-1 09
). Recent demonstrations of genus paraphyly in combination with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
[summarized in (
10 8
)] have prompted a variety of new generic treatments, including a division into two re-defined genera [
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
; see (

57

)], but we here follow the latest phylogenetic treatise that suggests a merger of all 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
into a single genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
10 8
).
</p>
            <p>
Despite the genus’s well-known evolutionary history, a sizeable sub-clade of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Australasian (including Indonesian) Archipelago has largely been omitted from modern molecular insights. Notable exceptions include the first-ever example of a new avian species description (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. rotiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) partly based on genome-wide DNA data from the Timor region (
11 0
). However, most island populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
in this region have been merged into a limited number of ‘wastebasket species’, e.g. Mountain Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trivirgatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and Island Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
, although vocal and plumage differences among them often far exceed those documented among the better- studied continental groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
8 0
). As a consequence, some modern treatments [e.g. (

57

)] have adopted a ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) in which pairwise plumage and vocal differences between archipelagic taxa that are comparable in magnitude to those between better-studied continental species pairs (or exceed them) are interpreted as being indicative of species status. In this way, a number of highly distinct island taxa have been elevated to species level, such as Buru Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. everetti
, Seram Leaf Warbler
</tp:taxon-name>
               <tp:taxon-name>
P. ceramensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[a treatment that had previously been suggested on the basis of vocal and plumage comparisons; see (

80

)], and a number of additional Wallacean taxa. Our description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
follows this framework of affording species rank to taxa when vocal and plumage characters indicate deeper divisions. We also bring genome-wide DNA data to bear on the taxonomic classification of these two new species. However, following the yardstick approach as applied under the Biological Species Concept, we believe that biological characters, especially bioacoustic ones, will be the most important indicators when conferring species status in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers.
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: As for plumage characters, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
differ from each other and from surrounding taxa in a number of important traits (see Diagnosis for each taxon) which are far more salient than the plumage differences of often identical-looking species pairs on the Asian continent that are otherwise vocally and phylogenetically deeply diverged [e.g. the three members of the Arctic Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. borealis
</tp:taxon-name>
trio; (
11 1
)]. Most importantly, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
has a contrastingly white throat and supercilium and a grey-and-white grizzled auricular patch where all other surrounding taxa are much more yellowish, rendering it instantly recognizable in large series of specimens. In contrast, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is superficially reminiscent of Sulawesi Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
in its overall more yellowish coloration, displaying a phenotypic leapfrog pattern that has been documented from the Taliabu-Peleng-Sulawesi island trio on multiple previous occasions (
50, 7 2
). However, this superficial resemblance notwithstanding, it has important distinctions in bare-parts coloration and overall pigmentation (see Diagnosis), apart from obvious vocal differences.

Bioacoustic evidence
: In bioacoustic terms, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by melodious jumbles of 1–1.5sec, mostly at 2000–6000 Hz, with short individual high notes between 5000–7000 Hz occasionally interspersed. Song motifs generally lack repetitive element sequences or trills (

). In contrast, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by 1.5–3sec strophes mostly between 2000–6500 Hz (typically of a wider frequency range than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
) that constitute a melodious jumble often followed by a final repetitive phrase, which can sometimes be omitted (

). In this respect, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is slightly more reminiscent of the East Sulawesi population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng (despite the geographic proximity of the latter two). The 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
population on Gunung Tumpu (East Sulawesi) is often characterized by strong repetitive series at a very broad frequency range (2500–7000 Hz), mostly preceded by a variable but simple melodious series of elements between 2000–5000 Hz and a brief nasal note separating this variable series from the repetitive series (

). Depending on the presence or absence of components, the song rendition (=motif) can be 1.5–4sec long. In summary, the songs of these three forms (

<tp:taxon-name>P. suaramerdu</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. emilsalimi</tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
), while highly variable, are predictably different and strongly indicative of species status when put into the context of song differences among other 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
species (

).

Genomic evidence
: We generated a set of ~4,100 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment spanning almost 3 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial cytochrome- 
b
(cyt- 
b
) sequences, to shed light on the differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in separate Methods paragraphs below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three taxa (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
from East Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population-genomic space based on ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (

). The main division according to genomic PCA occurred between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
versus the other two taxa (PC1 in 

). The same relationship was strongly reflected in maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of concatenated genome-wide sequence alignments of almost 3 million base pairs length as well as in maximum-parsimony (MP) analysis of a concatenated set of ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (topology 1 in 

). In contrast, mitochondrial cyt- 
b
gene analysis and species-tree inference of genome-wide SNPs recovered a topology in which 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
were strongly supported sister lineages, with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
being more basal (topology 2 in 

). Depths of uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence (as determined by cyt- 
b
distances) were comparatively low across all three leaf-warblers (0.7-1.6%; 

).
</p>
            <p>
In summary, our phylogenomic analyses demonstrated considerable incongruence among tree topologies, including a strong mito-nuclear discordance that calls into doubt the reliability of mitochondrial divergence values in this dataset. For instance, the deepest genomic divergence was detected between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other two species (PC1 in 

), whereas on mitochondrial cyt- 
b
evidence 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
displayed some of the most shallow divergences from the other taxa (

). The use of mitochondrial divergences in species delimitation suffers from multiple confounding biases (
79, 10 0, 10 1
), especially when dealing with complexes containing closely-allied allopatric taxa that have a propensity for secondary gene flow (
11 2-11 4
). The best explanatory hypothesis for the pronounced mito- nuclear discordance in this dataset is that occasional overwater dispersal followed by hybridization and gene flow may have led to the introgression of foreign alleles in one or the other species, obfuscating clean branching patterns. Gene flow during sporadic hybridization is known to artifactually reduce mitochondrial divergences, masking deeper levels of genomic differentiation (

79

). Hence, introgression can account for the presence of relatively low mitochondrial divergences in a group of species characterized by comparatively deep genomic divergences and pronounced levels of bioacoustic differentiation [(

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted DNA from the fresh muscle tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and the three specimens collected by us (including the holotype) of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
, along with one individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
that we had collected on Mt Tumpu on the eastern peninsula of Sulawesi (

19

). Additional tissue samples were obtained from the American Museum of Natural History, New York (AMNH): three samples of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
from South Sulawesi and an outgroup sample of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus pallescens
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Solomon Islands. The AMNH samples were only used for phylogenomic rooting. DNA extraction was performed using the Exgene Clinic SV kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul) following the manufacturer’s instructions. We eluted the DNA in two consecutive rounds of 100μl molecular grade water. We prepared double-digest restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing (ddRADSeq) libraries using the same protocol as Garg et al. (
11 5
) with EcoRI and MspI as restriction enzymes. We quantified DNA and library product concentrations using the Qubit 2.0 Broad Range DNA Assay (Invitrogen, California), and used a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Iowa) to perform final quality checks on the library product. The genomic libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform at the Singapore Center for Environmental Life Science Engineering. Filtering and demultiplexing of the genomic data in STACKS 1.34 followed the same general procedures as detailed by Ng et al. (
7 2
), and are the result of comprehensive trials using a wide variety of different parameters and settings at each step of the analysis. DNA data is deposited with Genbank at BioProject accession number PRJNA566263.
</p>
            <p>
SNP calling and genomic supermatrix generation:
Reference genome alignment was performed using BWA 0.7.12 (
9 1
) and samtools 0.1.19 (http://samtools.sourceforge.net) (
9 2, 9 3
) on the Greenish Warbler (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
) genome (
11 6
), the most closely related available full genome. We performed SNP calling in STACKS 1.34 as per Ng et al. (
7 2
). We required loci to be present across all individuals, and retained one random SNP per locus to exclude obviously linked SNP loci. Subsequently, we used PLINK 1.9 (
11 7
) and Bayescan 2.1 (
11 8
) to filter SNPs for linkage disequilibrium and signs of selection. Data format manipulation and conversions were performed with PGDSpider (
1 19
). The final filtered dataset totaled 4,104 SNPs. In addition, we created concatenated SNP datasets for each group for use in downstream maximum parsimony analysis.
</p>
            <p>
Following the procedures used by Ng et al. (
7 2
), we generated a concatenated read supermatrix without missing data using pyRAD (
12 0
). We stipulated a minimum required locus coverage of 20, and kept the clustering threshold within and between reads at the default of 0.88. The final concatenated read supermatrix amounted to 2,861,661 bp in length, generated from 19,985 loci.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial sequence generation:
We sequenced cyt- 
b
using the primers H16065 (
12 1
) and L14995 (
12 2
), with 40 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 72°C. We conducted PCR product cleanup with ExoSAP-IT 
®
and used the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) for cycle- sequencing. Sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer using capillary electrophoresis. We assembled cyt- 
b
sequences with CodonCode Aligner 4.1 and aligned them with ClustalW (
12 3
). The final cyt- 
b
alignment was 1,100bp long, indel- free and fully translatable. Mitochondrial sequences have been deposited with Genbank at accession numbers 
MN518858
- 
MN518862
.
</p>
            <p>
Population structure inference:
In order to test for the presence of geographic structuring across East Sulawesi, Peleng, and Taliabu, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the genomic SNP data. PCA was performed using ade4 (
12 4
) and factoextra (
12 5
), both available as R packages (
12 6
).
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial tree inference:
We constructed phylogenetic cyt- 
b
trees using two methods: maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML). We ran MP analyses using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
), performing 10,000 bootstrap replicates. For ML analyses, we first used jModelTest v2.1.6 (

97

) and determined that the Jukes-Cantor model (
12 8
) was the best performing substitution model. We then ran RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) using the extensive subtree-pruning-regrafting tree search algorithm.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic tree inference:
We applied three different genomic tree inference analyses: coalescent-based species tree inference (applied to the SNP dataset), maximum likelihood tree inference (applied to concatenated read supermatrix), and maximum parsimony tree inference (applied to the concatenated SNP dataset). We performed species tree inference using SNAPP (
1 29
) as implemented in BEAST 2.3.0, performing two iterations using default settings. Tracer 1.6 was used after each iteration to ensure that the runs had reached convergence, after which LogCombiner v2.3.0 and DensiTree (
13 0
) were used to process results. We carried out ML tree inference using RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) on the concatenated read supermatrix using the general-time-reversible gamma-invariant (GTRGAMMA) model and performed 1,000 rapid bootstrap searches. Finally, we conducted conventional MP analysis on the concatenated SNPs of each taxon set, using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
) and running 10,000 bootstrap replicates to evaluate branch support.

Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts are bronzy olive (2.5Y 3/4), the remiges and rectrices slightly darker and with more coppery edging (10YR 4/6). Dull white on breast reaches to chin, with an orange-rufescent tinge (7.5YR 7/6) surrounding the breast laterally and ventrally. Yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, with a rufescent-orange suffusion to flanks (7.5YR 7/6). Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Dark-horn mandible. Yellow-orange tarsus on live bird.

One of the phenotypically most distinct subspecies of the Mountain Tailorbird or Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Uniquely among all subspecies, the new taxon has a rufescent suffusion on throat and breast, becoming especially pronounced on breast sides and auriculars (from where it grades into the rufous crown), rendering the bird’s anterior aspect much warmer-tinged than all other subspecies. The upperparts, especially upper wings, are also warmer bronzy and the flanks tinged more rufescent than all other subspecies, making this the most reddish-looking taxon in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. It additionally differs from most other subspecies (except those from Sulawesi and Peleng) in the rufous crown’s more posterior extension to the nape and in the absence of a pale supercilium.
</p>
            <p>
It further differs from

(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis

malayanus

riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow on belly and lower breast (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near- complete absence of yellow, respectively). For additional differences from the new subspecies on Peleng, see SM8.

Davidson et al. (

<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoiler (then called an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird) for Taliabu, and characterized the population as inhabiting montane forest above 500m and possibly in need of taxonomic description. FER found this population commonly in disturbed montane forest to over 1,100 m, with a few records in dense secondary bamboo thickets down to 50m (

48

), and our collecting expedition re-encountered this form abundantly at elevations around 1,300m (

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, this new subspecies is currently only known from Taliabu in the Sula Archipelago. There, it inhabits disturbed situations (forest edge, bamboo thickets) mostly in the mountains, with the highest record at 1300m, but presumably ranging to the highest point at over 1400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). On other islands, mountain leaftoilers rarely range lower than ~500m (

57

), but Rheindt (

48

) exceptionally recorded the new taxon on Taliabu from an extensive bamboo thicket at ~50m, demonstrating that this population may tolerate lower elevations. The presence of this leaftoiler on the other two main Sula islands, Mangole and Sanana, is likely, especially on the former, which rises to over 1,100m, but perhaps also on the latter, which reaches to a little over 600m. However, it has probably been overlooked owing to a lack of fieldwork at higher elevations on these two islands. On the Banggai Archipelago, the species is represented by another novel subspecies (see below) that replaces 
sulanus
there. Its predilection for disturbed forest situations and wide elevational tolerance as compared to other insular mountain birds probably means that it is currently not of conservation concern.

Crown and nape rich rufous (2.5YR 4/10), slightly darker posteriorly, and not extending as far onto the nape as in the new Taliabu subspecies (
P. c. sulanus
; see SM7). Short blackish eyestripe. Facial region from auriculars to lores dusky-grey (N3) with an increasing rufous suffusion (concolorous with crown) towards the malar and moustachial regions. Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts olive with a slight bronzy hue (5Y 3/4), colder-colored than in the new subspecies from Taliabu (
P. c. sulanus
). Remiges and rectrices are darker and duskier, but with outer edging nearly concolorous with mantle. Underparts are bicolored, with a white chin to breast, and a lemon-yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, and with a dusky olive suffusion on the flanks. Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Tarsus dark-yellow. On the live bird, the upper mandible was black with a yellow tip, and the lower mandible was black with a yellow base and tip. The iris color was not clearly discerned on the live bird.

            <p>
A distinct new subspecies of Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(or ‘Mountain Tailorbird’), differing from adjacent subspecies to the east and to the west in important discrete characters.
</p>
            <p>
The lack of a supercilium and the posterior extension of the rufous crown coloration onto the mid-nape set this subspecies apart from most other subspecies, except those from Sulawesi and Taliabu, which have an equally or sometimes even slightly more extensive rufous crown. It further differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis
(Borneo), 
malayanus
(Malay Peninsula) and all subspecies further west and north in the absence of a strong grey hindcollar band and/or strongly grey breast sides; from 
<tp:taxon-name>
batjanensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(Bacan Island) in its lemon-yellow belly lacking a strong olive suffusion; and from 
dumasi
(Seram and Buru) in its much less brown-colored upperparts. In many aspects, the new taxon is similar to the set of subspecies on Sulawesi (
riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow belly (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near-complete absence of yellow, respectively).
</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies shares many unique traits with the new subspecies from Taliabu 
sulanus
(see SM7), but differs significantly in its darker chestnut crown and its less reddish overall appearance, largely lacking a rufescent suffusion to the breast and flanks, and showing much less rufescent on the auriculars; its flanks are also much colder olive-washed (versus warmly rufescent-washed), and the upperparts and especially upper wings are colder bronze-olive. On live birds, the legs are much darker and less intensely colorful than those of birds from Taliabu.

FER and Filip Verbelen first encountered and documented the new subspecies during a visit to the highlands of western Peleng between 22-31 March 2009 (

Typical of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers, this new taxon is restricted to forest edge situations, treefall gaps and bamboo thickets in montane forest on the island of Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago. During our combined visits to the island (

19
, 
49

), we recorded this new taxon from 750m to the highest point at over 1000m elevation. It may, therefore, not range as low as the new taxon from neighboring Taliabu, although future fieldwork may well produce lower elevational records. Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago is unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new subspecies. Despite its very small range, its predilection for disturbed forest situations probably means that it is not particularly negatively affected by the current degradation that is impacting most highland forests of western Peleng.

Taxonomic rationale (combined for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus sulanus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
P. c. relictus
)


</p>
            <p>
The Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
was previously thought to be an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird and then called Mountain Tailorbird. We here acknowledge the distant relationship to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbirds (
13 1
) and therefore follow the recent trend of calling members of this species ‘leaftoilers’ rather than tailorbirds [e.g. (

57

)], a fitting translation from their re- instated scientific genus name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
. As for the species name 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, we follow the recently proposed emendation (

6

) of the original spelling of the name (‘ 
cuculatus’
) on the basis of information in the original description showing that the name was meant to refer to the birds’ hooded appearance (from Latin cucullus – hood).
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: The new subspecies 
sulanus
from Taliabu is arguably one of the most distinctly-colored, if not the single most distinctly-colored subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(see Diagnosis) and is therefore well-deserving of subspecies status. Its reddish-suffused anterior body renders it instantly recognizable among any series of specimens. Although not as unique in morphology, we also describe 
relictus
from Peleng at the subspecific level mainly on the basis of its distinct coloration. In plumage distinctness, 
relictus
far exceeds several other previously recognized subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, such as 
P. c. cinereicollis
.
</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic evidence
: We have been unsuccessful in procuring a sufficiently large sample set of song recordings of the two new subspecies, precluding rigorous bioacoustic analysis. However, we note that the songs given by these two subspecies in the field did not strike us as very different from the songs of other subspecies we are familiar with. Song playback with recordings from several other islands elicited a ready response at least in 
P. c. relictus
. Based on our bioacoustic experience with Indonesian passerines, we do not have the impression that song differences of the two new subspecies would warrant anything but a subspecific treatment at the present time.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic evidence
: We created a set of ~8,500 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment of over 2 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase intron 2 (ND2) sequences, to investigate levels of differentiation among 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in a separate Methods paragraph below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three subspecies (
P. c. stentor
from eastern Sulawesi, 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng and 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population- genomic space (

). The main genomic division according to a PCA based on ~8,500 SNPs occurred between 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu versus the other two subspecies (PC1 in 

). In contrast to the leaf-warbler analysis (see SM6), this main genomic division among leaftoilers was also supported by the mitochondrial tree and the genomic ‘species tree’ (

), consistently placing 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng close to 
P. c. stentor
from Sulawesi, although the concatenated tree built from genome-wide loci was in conflict, placing 
P. c. relictus
closer to 
P. c. sulanus
. Coincidentally, the majority tree with a basal placement of 
sulanus
(topology 1 in 

) is also the arrangement that would be supported by the extraordinarily divergent plumage of 
sulanus
, making it unique among all leaftoiler subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
Pairwise divergences between the subspecies (as determined by ND2 distances) were relatively low (0.3-1.7%; 

), at levels generally accepted to be below the species threshold for birds [(~2-3%; (
100, 10 1
)], consistent with the current proposed subspecies status. These ND2 divergences further supported the majority tree (topology 1 in 

) by consistently rendering 
P. c. sulanus
as the most deeply diverged subspecies (up to ~1.7%), whereas 
P. c. relictus
and 
P. c. stentor
emerged as only 0.3% diverged.
</p>
            <p>
In summary, mitochondrial sequence analysis, PCA of genome-wide SNPs and ‘species-tree’ analysis all agree in placing 
P. c. sulanus
basal to the other two subspecies, an arrangement supported by its distinct plumage. Therefore, we have no reason to suspect bias in the mitochondrial divergence depth (unlike in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
, see SM6), which supports our bioacoustic assessment that both 
relictus
and 
sulanus
are at the subspecies level. Future studies of the uniquely colored 
P. c. sulanus
may yet challenge this assessment.
</p>
            <p>
Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted genomic DNA of all tissue material available for 
P. c. sulanus
(n=5) and 
P. c. relictus
(n=2), along with two samples of 
P. c. stentor
that we had independently collected on Mt Tumpu on the adjacent eastern Sulawesi peninsula (

19

). Tissue of a single individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cettia parens
</tp:taxon-name>
from Makira in the Solomon Islands, provided by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was also extracted to serve as an outgroup in phylogenomic rooting. Laboratory and analytical protocols followed our procedures outlined in SM6 (under 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
), utilizing the same reference genome (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
), but using a minimum stack depth of 5 in STACKS 1.34 and a minimum required locus coverage of 5 in pyRAD due to differences in sequencing quality. The final filtered dataset for the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers totaled 8,515 SNPs and the final concatenated read supermatrix was 2,002,726 bp long, generated from 13,194 separate loci. For mitochondrial analysis, we sequenced ND2 using the primers L5219Met and H6313Trp (
13 2
) with 35 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 50-53°C, but otherwise following the procedures as outlined in SM6. The final ND2 alignment for the leaftoilers was 1,015bp long, indel-free and fully translatable. All DNA data has been deposited with Genbank at accession number PRJNA566263 and 
MN518850

Hartert, 1920 (‘extremely neglected’) from Selayar Island, were based on the impression that the description of these birds had escaped the attention of researchers for too long. The presently described taxon, only discovered in the 21

century, fulfils that criterion even more adequately, so we take pleasure in naming it 
omississimus
(‘the most neglected’), superlative of ‘omissus’.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The immature plumage remains undocumented. The only two male specimens known to exist (holotype and MZB.Ornit.34.488) show minimal plumage variation, the only difference perhaps being the latter specimen’s slightly brighter, more brilliant rump and darker, more blackish tarsus and claws in life.</p>
            <p>As compared to males, the three female specimens have a duller blue supercilium (but still discernible), lack a black chin, have prominent rufous spectacles over a narrow blackish stripe through the cere, the rufous continuing to the lower sides of the face where it is finely speckled dark (in two of three females the speckling continues to the throat sides), and have much less dark blackish-blue auriculars, contrasting less with the rufous throat. The female’s upperparts are less brilliant blue. One of the three female specimens is slightly paler on the tarsus and claws.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new subspecies was first reported by Indrawan et al. (
13 3
), who documented the sighting of a female on 15 May 2001 and a male on 29 July 2001 at 50-100m elevation around Benteng on the main island of Togian, and pointed out that this new population may be an undescribed subspecies. Following their footsteps, Filip Verbelen (pers. comm.) made the first sound recordings of the new population in December 2008 when studying a few individuals on Kadidiri, a tiny forested tourist resort island off the coast of Togian measuring ~4km in length and less than 1km in width. A few days later, F. Verbelen moved to Batudaka, one of the three main islands of the archipelago, where he found additional individuals in coastal forest near the capital town of Wakai. FER visited Batudaka Island from 23-27 April 2009 and observed this new population. On our collecting trip, we visited Batudaka from 24-28 Dec 2013 and found this taxon to be common in the forests outside the capital town of Wakai, collecting the present material in the process (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>The new subspecies is known from the Togian Archipelago in the Gulf of Tomini, a satellite group of islands between the northern and eastern peninsulas of Sulawesi. More specifically, to the best of our knowledge the new subspecies has so far been found on the two main islands of Togian and Batudaka, as well as on the tiny islet of Kadidiri off Togian, where it is common in remnant forest and edge from near sea level to at least ~200m elevation. However, it is likely that the birds occur up to the highest elevations at ~430m on these islands. More field research is required to map this subspecies’ occurrence on other islands in this archipelago. Its presence on some of the larger, forest-covered islands in close proximity to Batudaka and Togian, such as Talatakoh, Waleakodi and Waleabahi, is virtually guaranteed, given its occurrence on tiny Kadidiri. However, its presence on slightly more distant islands, such as Puah (at ~18km from the main archipelago) and Unauna (at ~28km from the main archipelago) is less certain, although these latter islands are connected to the main archipelago by shallow sea-beds not exceeding 120m depth, indicating that they would have been connected with one another during glacial sea level recessions.</p>
            <p>
On the main island of Sulawesi, the newly described 
omississimus
is replaced by the nominate taxon 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Unusually, however, the nominate form on Sulawesi is a hill and montane forest denizen, occurring from 500-2300m elevation and shunning lowland forest habitats in stark contrast to the new subspecies.
</p>
            <p>The new subspecies appears to be moderately tolerant to habitat disturbance where small-scale timber extraction leads to a secondarization of primary forest. However, the taxon disappears where forest is converted into agricultural land. Although Togian’s forests are quickly dwindling, with most remnants by now secondary and restricted to inland locations away from the coast, far more than half of the islands should still be suitable for the new taxon, making it safe for the time being.</p>

            <p>
Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The proposed English name of this new taxon follows a recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] to call members of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
‘jungle-flycatchers’ rather than ‘blue-flycatchers’ because molecular data (
13 4
) and bioacoustic considerations (
57, 7 4
) strongly suggest a merger of many members of the previously recognized jungle-flycatcher genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinomyias
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Given that numerous species in the resultant genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
are no longer blue but entirely brown, the name ‘blue-flycatcher’, while formerly appropriate, is no longer suitable for this genus.
</p>
            <p>
Although distinguishable from other subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
in terms of plumage characters (see Diagnosis), 
omississimus
is quite similar to them in general coloration. At any rate, plumage coloration is not an ideal taxonomic indicator in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
jungle-flycatchers, many of which boast a highly conserved male plumage sporting blue upperparts and reddish underparts. Other characters, such as bioacoustic and genetic ones, may be more conducive to guiding taxonomic decision-making in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
We recently published a bioacoustic comparison on the basis of six vocal parameters among members of the greater 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, showing that the song of the newly described 
omississimus
from Togian exhibits considerable vocal overlap with the songs of all three analyzed subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
, while distinctly differing from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. kalaoensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[see 

in (
7 4
)]. This vocal evidence along with Togian’s proximity to Sulawesi suggest a placement of 
omississimus
as a subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Based on a lack of deep differentiation in both bioacoustic and genetic evidence, we propose to classify this new taxon at the subspecies level. Upon first discovery in the field, we were generally impressed by its lowland forest occurrence, which stands in contrast to the montane forest requirements of the nominate subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi. This pronounced difference in habitat preference was given much weight in supporting species- level recognition of the new Togian population in a recently published field guide to the region (

57

). However, given Gwee et al.’s (
7 4
) newly published data, the latter treatment has ultimately proved erroneous.

in its lack of solid white or rufous on the belly; its uniform dark-brown coloration in which only the underparts show a faint warm tinge; and its unmarked dark-brown vent. The new subspecies has a darker hood and breast than the above-mentioned taxa except for the intensely rufous-bellied 
fumidus
and perhaps 
hygroscopus
. It also differs from 
deningeri
from Seram in its paler, browner (less black) body color, with a darker non-contrasting hood, and differs from 
schlegelii
and 
sterlingi
(both from Timor) in its less olive overall coloration and lack of rufous belly and vent.
</p>
            <p>
Within Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely resembles the much larger and longer-winged 
versteegi
and 
papuensis
from Papua but is dark slaty-brown (versus black) in overall body color and has an unmarked vent. The lower underparts have more extensive and paler-cinnamon feather margins in the new subspecies versus narrower, more rufous feather margins in the Papuan forms.
</p>
            <p>
Among geographically more distant Island Thrush subspecies from outside of Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely approaches three taxa from the Solomon Islands (
bougainvillei, kulambangrae, sladeni)
and two taxa from the Bismarck Archipelago (
heinrothi, beehleri
), but lacks those subspecies’ blackish overall body color. It also superficially resembles 
nigrorum
from Negros (Philippines), but the latter subspecies’ lower belly grades into whitish on the vent while the new subspecies is uniformly dark on those parts. Furthermore, another Philippine subspecies, 
kelleri
from Mt Apo (Mindanao), is similar to the new subspecies but becomes darker brown towards the front of the head while the new subspecies has a nearly uniform head coloration becoming slightly paler on the forehead.

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The subspecies name, translated from Bahasa Indonesia “it likes the rain” (=suka hujan), refers to the circumstances surrounding the bird’s discovery. On FER’s first expedition to the highest parts of Taliabu (

48

), heavy persistent rain impeded bird observations, leading to a decision to abort the expedition ahead of schedule. On his premature descent, FER then spotted a hardy individual of the new thrush, perched in the pouring rain, leading him to change plans yet again and mount a subsequent second and eventually third expedition to these elevations in better weather. This latter third expedition then allowed for a more detailed documentation of Taliabu’s distinct novel montane avifauna (

19
, 
48

). The name 
sukahujan
is treated as an inalienable noun in apposition.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>All nine specimens procured resemble one another considerably in coloration. The greatest variation occurs in the tone of the lower breast and abdomen, which is intermediate in the holotype but ranges from all-drab brownish grey throughout with almost no warm edging (in MZB.Ornit.34.416) to more extensive cinnamon feather edging (in most adult females, especially MZB.Ornit.34.409), the latter leading to an overall warmer underparts impression. Females are variably slightly less slaty on upperparts and crown, and one adult individual (MZB.Ornit.34.416) of unknown sex has a male-like slaty tone on upperparts but a female- like crown color that is more suffused with dull brown. Two juveniles (MZB.Ornit.34.410; MZB.Ornit.34.417) exhibit noticeable mottling on their mantle and underparts coloration, caused by dark brownish-black feather margins contrasting against the paler (on underparts sometimes warm cinnamon) feather centers.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new taxon was first discovered on 8 and 9 April 2009 by FER near its type locality on the occasion of a hike to the highest elevations on Taliabu that was cut short by heavy rainfall. Subsequent sightings on 14 and 15 April 2009 were made in the same area on the occasion of a return visit (

48

). We found this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected the type along with the accompanying specimens.

<tp:taxon-name>
T. poliocephalus

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
With approximately 50 subspecies, the Island Thrush 
<tp:taxon-name>
Turdus poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
is arguably the most polytypic bird species on Earth (
13 5
). Attempts to separate this variable species complex into smaller species-level lineages [e.g. (
13 6
)] have been called into question by genetic data showing that plumage characters are not a good predictor of close relationships in this complex (
13 7
). Hence, modern sources generally continue to unite all or most subspecies into one polytypic species. Not unlike some Philippine subspecies previously under study (
13 7
), the new subspecies from Taliabu is phenotypically extremely different from neighboring forms but more closely resembles certain geographically distant subspecies. It is presently best accommodated at the subspecies level. Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic inquiries are needed in the future to assess whether any internal species limits must be drawn within the complex. Such future analyses may well elevate the Taliabu Island Thrush to species level. However, such analyses are currently hampered by a lack of crucial comparative DNA material.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Forehead to crown and nape dark slaty blue (2.5PB 2/2) with slightly scaly appearance generated through narrow black feather centres; the same color, but without the scaly appearance, then continues through mantle and scapulars to rump. A white supercilium starts above the centre of the eye and ends just shy of the bill base, becoming narrower towards the front. A black facial patch centred in the loral region and below the supercilium to the chin (with narrow rows of black feathers above the bill base) grades into dark slaty blue coloration (2.5PB 1.5/2) towards the auriculars and the malar and moustachial regions, merging with the nape and mantle. Upperwing coverts largely concolorous with crown, with vestiges of an extremely indistinct brighter carpal patch visible with difficulty on this specimen. Remiges are dark slaty brown (10YR 2.5/1), the larger primaries with warmer, paler outer edging (10YR 4/2). Breast intensely rufous (7.5YR 7/12), becoming slightly paler on throat and upper flanks, and becoming pale cinnamon-whitish on belly and lower flanks (7.5YR 9/4), and eventually off-white on undertail coverts. Tail dull black on upper side, blackish-grey (N2) on underside, with indistinct white base to outermost rectrices. Iris dark-brown; legs light-pink; black bill with pinkish gape flange on live bird.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
An unequivocal member of the Snowy-browed Flycatcher 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ficedula hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
, and one of its most easterly outposts, with minor plumage distinctions in the male and major plumage distinctions in the female, a combination of which conclusively demarcates this new taxon from other subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
The male subtly differs from adjacent insular subspecies to the south and to the west, namely from the two Sulawesi subspecies (
jugosae, annalisa
), from 
sumatrana
(Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo), from 
vulcani
(Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores), and from 
alifura
(Buru), in the reduction of white patches at the base of the outer tail feathers, and in the slightly less extensive rufous underparts, replaced on the belly by pale cinnamon- whitish. In contrast, males of the only subspecies to the east and north (
pallidipectus
from Bacan Island) are markedly paler on the underparts than the males of this new subspecies, and have more contrastingly olive flanks. The white supercilium in males of the new subspecies is narrower than that of at least 
sumatrana, vulcani
, and 
alifura
.
</p>
            <p>
The female is highly distinct from most subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
in her bluish (versus olive, brown or grey-brown) upperparts coloration, extensive cold-brown mottling on breast (versus little to none), and a washed-out face pattern ghosting that of the male, with a whiter (versus rufous) brow. The only other subspecies that equals female 
F. h. betinabiru
in her bluish tinge to the upperparts is 
alifura
from adjacent Buru, in which the back color is ever so slightly brighter-blue. Compared to the new subspecies, the female of 
alifura
exhibits a more rufous (less white) eye brow, and brighter and more extensive rufous underparts with less brown mottling.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>
Only adult specimens have been procured, although a photo of a 
pullus
near the nest suggests an early juvenile plumage similar to other subspecies. Among adults, tarsus color as recorded in the field on live birds appears to vary individually from light-pink to pinkish-horn.
</p>
            <p>There is minor variation among the nine adult male specimens procured in the lower extent of the rufous breast, the intensity of the cinnamon wash to the belly, thickness of the supercilium and the extent of vestigial white patches on the basal outer rectrices. There is minor variation among the five adult female specimens in the intensity of brown mottling on the underparts, width and paleness of the supercilium and the presence or absence of a slight brownish tinge to the lowermost mantle portion.</p>

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies of Snowy-browed Flycatcher was first encountered by the University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 (
64, 9 8
). Members of that survey found the new taxon predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m) and suggested that it may be a novel subspecies. FER then saw one adult male at 1100m during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu on 5 April 2009 (

48

). We returned to this general area between 6-16 December 2013, where we found 
betinabiru
as one of the most common constituents of the forest interior understorey avifauna and collected the type and accompanying individuals at ~1300m (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
Subspecies 
betinabiru
is currently only known from the understorey of dense montane forest in the highlands of Taliabu at above 800m elevation (
19, 48, 64, 9 8
). Extensive logging has occurred across the highlands of Taliabu, with some parts of the mountains additionally affected by large-scale forest fires (see Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler account in SM3; 

). As an understory inhabitant, 
betinabiru
would be particularly susceptible to this kind of habitat degradation and is therefore probably declining. Nevertheless, it remains extremely common where good habitat persists, as indicated by our high mistnet capture rates (

19

).
</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, Snowy-browed Flycatchers have not been detected on the two other main islands of the Sula Archipelago, although their occurrence is possible at least on Mangole, which rises to 1,127m, while very unlikely on Sanana, which does not rise taller than ~600m. If confirmed on Mangole, it is likely that the local population would refer to the same subspecies 
betinabiru
.
</p>
            <p>
On the adjacent Banggai Archipelago, a single Snowy-browed Flycatcher was recorded once in April 2009 at 800-900m on the tallest island of Peleng (

49

). To the best of our knowledge, there have not been subsequent records from this island despite extensive fieldwork. In the absence of photos or closer details about the single Peleng record, it is impossible to ascertain whether the Peleng population is ascribable to 
betinabiru
, to one of the two Sulawesi races (
annalisa, jugosae
) or to a novel unnamed subspecies.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We describe this new taxon on the basis of its characteristic plumage (especially in females). These plumage distinctions certainly warrant a description at the subspecific level as they exceed those of several more poorly marked subspecies within this complex (e.g. 
annalisa
[Stresemann, 1931], which only subtly differs from 
jugosae
[Riley, 1921]). Bioacoustic variation in this species complex is poorly explored, but the high-pitched courtship vocalization of the new subspecies superficially resembles that of many other subspecies, and playback of songs from other subspecies elicits a ready response from members of this population. Genetic differences between the new taxon and other subspecies remain unexplored.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Crown, nape, ear coverts and neck sides are mid-brown (7.5YR 4/2), with a distinct cinnamon-chestnut forehead extending over eye (7.5YR 4/8). Black rictal bristles. Nape color slowly grading into warmer cinnamon-rufous (2.5YR 4/10) across mantle, scapulars and rump to the basal 60% portion of tail. The outer remiges are mostly dark dusky-brown (7.5YR 2/1), becoming paler and more olive-brown (7.5YR 4/2) towards the inner remiges. All remiges have narrow but intense rufous outer edging concolorous with rump and lower back color. The wing coverts are almost identical to the inner remiges in color, with an increasing intensity and width of bright-rufous feather tipping towards the median and lesser coverts. The distal 40% of the tail is greyish-black (N2), with paler rufous tips (5YR 5/6) on the underside only. Chin and throat form a white triangle delimited below by a conspicuous large black breast patch. A diffuse band of grey coloration (N5) with a black scaly appearance created by black feathers with narrow grey edging demarcates the black breast patch on its lower side. The belly is pale buff (7.5YR 9/8), grading into a richer, fuller hue on the flanks and undertail coverts (7.5YR 5/6). The iris is dark-brown, the bill black with a pinkish base to the lower mandible, and the tarsus on the live bird was described as pinkish- horn.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A mid-sized, rufous-toned 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura
</tp:taxon-name>
typical of a radiation of fantails distributed throughout Australasia. It most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
(

57

), and constitutes the third member of this radiation. Its plumage distinctions from the other two species are subtle yet consistent. However, the most characteristic distinction is its unique courtship vocalization (
7 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, the new species differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Sula Islands in its much narrower, less distinct rufous tips to the underside of the rectrices, in its more distinct black scaling below the black breast patch, and in its more strongly cinnamon-buff (less white) central underparts. The new species’ throat is cleaner white, less interspersed with dusky tips to the feathers.
</p>
            <p>
The new species differs from all three subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi in its wider black portion of the tail and its warmer brown crown and upper mantle. When compared to the geographically most closely adjacent subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni toradja
</tp:taxon-name>
from eastern and central Sulawesi, the new species additionally differs in its cleaner white throat and slightly less conspicuous scaling below the black breast patch, while it is additionally distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
of the Lompobattang Massif in South Sulawesi by its blacker breast patch and by the richer chestnut (less cinnamon) coloration of its brighter body parts (such as supercilium, rear upperparts, flanks and vent).

Etymology

</p>
            <p>The new species’ epithet is in honor of the late Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie (deceased 11 Sep 2019), the third president of the Republic of Indonesia. President Habibie was known as a keen environmentalist and contributed greatly to the science and conservation of nature in Indonesia.</p>

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The only three specimens (all adult; one female, two males) exhibit limited variation in terms of extent of breast patch and black mottling below breast patch that may have been caused by the preparation of the specimens.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new species has doubtless been known to the local inhabitants of Peleng Island for a long time. Mochamad Indrawan was presumably the first outside ornithologist to see this new bird when encountering a dead individual during his work on Peleng in the mid-2000s and re- encountering the species in the wild on several undated occasions (

49

). During a field trip between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently observed the species near the type locality (

49

), where we returned from 18-23 Dec 2013 to collect the type and the accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new species is restricted to montane forest on the island of Peleng, the largest landmass in the Banggai Archipelago, at elevations not lower than 750m (

19
, 
49

) (

). Over two longer visits to the highlands of Peleng, we found that the species becomes gradually more common towards higher elevations before it seems to drop out somewhere slightly below the tallest peak on Peleng at 1,022m. The new species is replaced on Sulawesi to the west by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
, and on the Sula Archipelago to the east by 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Its occurrence on other islands of the Banggai Archipelago is highly unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
must be considered threatened given the small extent of its occurrence and the continuing loss of its habitat. Only 25,071 ha of land on Peleng fall above the approximate 750m elevational cutoff, most of it formerly constituting a single contiguous block of highland forest (

). However, our own observations in combination with satellite imagery indicate extensive forest loss to small-scale agriculture and logging by burgeoning village communities. Google Earth’s present coverage of the area is mixed, with large swathes covered by insufficient or outdated (e.g., 2004) imagery. However, given current satellite coverage, a conservative estimate is that 9,987 ha (~40%) from within the elevational range of

have either been completely deforested or constitute young regrowth or unviable forest fragments surrounded by clearings. This would leave only 15,084 ha of more or less undisturbed primary or older secondary forest. Recent observations indicate, however, that this extent of forest loss is probably an underestimate. After the first discovery of this species and a number of other new bird taxa on Peleng (

49

), the island became a destination for an average of 1-3 international adventure and birdwatching tour groups per year, which considerably helped spur the local economy of the village near the type locality (name withheld). While this sort of ecotourism has a positive impact on the natural environment in many reported cases, on Peleng the sudden influx of tourist dollars led to observations of increased logging and expansion of infrastructure, prompting the rapid destruction of forest at the original type locality over the last five years. In the near future, it will be of paramount importance for the survival of Peleng’s unique montane fauna to find ways in which the influx of eco-tourism dollars can create incentives for conservation.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
Based on its plumage coloration, the new species is clearly a member of the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, hitherto known from Sulawesi and the Sula Archipelago (

57

). The discovery of a new constituent of this radiation on the Banggai Archipelago closes the geographic gap between Sulawesi and Sula. Most previous taxonomic treatises (e.g. 
6 1, 7 5
) have regarded all members of this radiation as conspecific, and indeed plumage differences are relatively minor and have long been interpreted as consistent with a subspecific treatment. However, recent research into patterns of bioacoustic and genomic differentiation among rusty-bellied fantails from Sulawesi, Sula and Banggai has produced strong evidence in favor of species level treatment of all three island populations (
7 2
).

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="biology_ecology">
            <p>
Vocalizations
: Bioacoustically, the courtship vocalization (=song) of the new species from Peleng is the most distinct of any member of the radiation. A detailed characterization of this song has been published elsewhere (

49

). In fact, when we first found the species in the field, the bird stood out through its unusual, simple descending song that lacks the typical complex tinkling quality of its congeners (

49

). Quantitative bioacoustic comparisons revealed that the unusual vocal features of the new Peleng species have led to an acoustic leapfrog pattern in rusty-bellied fantails in which the two terminal (=easternmost and westernmost) species (i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) are more similar to each other in courtship vocalizations but are geographically divided by the new species with its unusual song (
7 2
). The great vocal distinctness of the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
is surprising because it belies its geographic proximity to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
(Sulawesi)
</tp:taxon-name>
across a combined lowland and sea gap of less than 40km and its frequent land connection to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
(Taliabu)
</tp:taxon-name>
across Pleistocene land bridges during times of global cooling (

49

). Vocal behavior is known to be an important feature in species cohesion and reproductive isolation in songbirds (
7 6, 77
), and has been shown to be more important as an indicator of species limits than plumage traits in some passerine lineages (

78

). Therefore, recent authors have accepted the unmistakable vocal uniqueness of the new Peleng fantail as an indication of its status as an undescribed new species (
57, 7 2
).

Genomic data
: In a previously published analysis (
7 2
), we conducted a comparison of&gt;11,000 genome-wide markers with a complete representation among 16 individuals spanning all three species within the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. In this analysis, the new species from Peleng emerged as most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (both subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
toradja
) and less closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sula. This phylogenomic result is significant considering that – among all pairwise vocal comparisons – the greatest bioacoustic differentiation is found between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and the new species, with strong vocal distinctions in both non-courtship vocalizations and courtship songs (
7 2
). Therefore, the relatively shallowest genomic differentiation among the three island populations corresponds to the deepest bioacoustic divergence.
</p>
            <p>
Although the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
emerged as most closely related within the radiation, comparisons of genome-wide data allow for the designation of both taxa as independent species: the basal split between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other taxa is mainly based on a genomic signal contained in ~20% of the genetic variance across study loci, whereas the second most dominant genomic signature – contained in ~14% of the genetic variance across markers – predominantly represents the deep divergence between the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
[

in (
7 2
)]. The presence of a significant proportion of genomic locus cohorts displaying deep differentiation between the new species and either of its two neighbors was in agreement with gene flow analyses (‘ABBA-BABA tests’) that pointed to a history of rare introgression between the new species and its neighbors (
7 2
), perhaps during episodes of unusual climate forcing dispersal between islands. Such secondary introgression is not unusual among congeneric bird species (

79

) and is not in conflict with species level treatment.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>
The entire crown from forehead to nape is rich earthen-brown (7.5YR 3/3) with slightly darker feather margins creating a scalloped appearance. A thin off-white supercilium is pronounced from bill base to just behind eye, from where it slowly tapers out. Lores are dark brownish-black (2.5Y 1.5/1). Ear coverts are of a medium earthen-brown tone (5YR 3/1) with fine pale shaft streaks giving a grizzled appearance, grading into a more greyish-brown tone (10YR 6/1) in the moustachial and malar region. The mantle and scapulars down to the uppertail coverts are largely concolorous with the crown but lack the scalloping created by darker feather margins. The remiges are mostly a rich cold dark-brown (2.5YR 2/1) but have warmer outer webs concolorous with mantle. The upperwing coverts are similarly two-toned, being mostly concolorous with mantle but some showing darker outer webs concolorous with most of remiges. As typical for the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
, the rectrices are narrow and dark- brown, very close in color to the remiges (2.5YR 2/1). The tail feathers are mostly worn, although one in the centre appears to be a new replacement.
</p>
            <p>The white chin and throat are quite sharply demarcated from the face. The lower throat and upper breast, still white, are interspersed with fine dusky speckling increasing towards the breast and lower throat sides where the color grades into a solid mid-grey (N5) with only few inconspicuous dusky speckles. The grey breast color then grades into a tawny- ochraceous belly color (7.5YR 4/6), first through tracts of grey feathers which have warm- ochraceous edging, then through tracts of largely ochraceous feathers that still have a grey feather centre, eventually to all-ochraceous feathers. The belly color becomes darker and richer on the undertail coverts and flanks (7.5YR 3/4).</p>
            <p>The bill is black with an inconspicuous paler tip. The gape on the live bird was slightly enlarged light yellow. The iris is dark brown. The tarsus and toes were described on the live bird as maroon-horn with paler, more yellowish toepads.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A rich dark-brown forest warbler typical of the montane resident 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. As is usual across this cryptic genus, the new taxon is most conspicuous not on the basis of its plumage but its vocalizations.
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, it is most similar in size and shape to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
of Sulawesi. However, in comparison to the new taxon, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
has less distinct speckling on the breast, has a more uniform crown that is less scalloped, paler and warmer brown upperparts, greyer underparts with brown mostly only on flanks, and has a less pointed, wider tail.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram differs in its less distinct central breast spotting, greyer (less whitish) supercilium, and more extensive grey on breast reaching further onto upper breast, neck sides and auriculars.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru differs in its much whiter breast, with off-white reaching onto mid-belly, whereas only the lower flanks and lower belly are warm-brown. Although the central breast of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
has a mid-grey tinge, its underparts are much paler than the new species’ fairly uniform grey lower breast, which grades into a fairly dark homogeneous warm-brown belly.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is quite different from the smaller 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. montis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Java. The latter is much paler cinnamon-brown on upperparts, crown and especially remiges and rectrices, and is uniformly buff-white below with extensive dark-brown speckling from chin to upper belly, lacking the new species’ grey tones on the breast and dark warm-brown tones on the belly.

The name 
<tp:taxon-name>
portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
– past participle of Latin ‘portendere’ – roughly translates as “the predicted one” or “the foretold one” and relates to the unusual circumstances of discovery when FER first heard the new warbler and recognized it to be a novel species of

multiple days before a visual confirmation was obtained.

            <p>Currently only one adult specimen is available (i.e., the holotype), and photos of up to two more adults suggest that this is probably a sexually monomorphic species with limited plumage variation.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
FER was the first person to discover 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on 9 April 2009 near its type locality when he heard an unmistakable insect-like sound that he attributed to a hitherto unnamed taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
grasshopper-warbler. Having been exposed to the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on a visit to Sulawesi only two weeks prior, and having had previous field experience with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru and Seram, respectively (
8 0
), FER was aware that the song of this population – albeit superficially reminiscent of the others – is distinct at the species level. Even so, because of the retiring nature of this bird and ill-timed heavy rain, it took FER another two hiking expeditions to the highlands of Taliabu to finally confirm on 15 April 2009 that this song was indeed uttered by what he perceived as an “unusually dark” individual of grasshopper-warbler (

48

). We encountered this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected a single specimen, now the holotype.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is presumably restricted to montane forest at the highest elevations of the island of Taliabu (

19
, 
48

) (

). All our records are from elevations above 1,050m on the more mountainous western half of the island of Taliabu, which reaches its highest altitude of ~1,415m at an unnamed peak near our collection locality (

). The new species inhabits a peculiar type of dwarf montane forest typical of these elevations.
</p>
            <p>
The occurrence of the new species on neighboring islands is highly doubtful. Of the three major islands that form the Sula archipelago, Taliabu is the largest and tallest. The smallest main island, Sanana, barely reaches above 600m elevation. The highest elevation on its larger neighbor Mangole is 1,127m – theoretically within the elevational range of this grasshopper-warbler – but the area of land above 1,050m on Mangole is only ~36 ha, which is too small an area to allow for the survival of a highly montane bird species throughout evolutionary time scales. On the neighboring Banggai archipelago, the situation is similar: the only island high enough to allow for the theoretical possibility of grasshopper-warbler breeding occurrence is Peleng (highest elevation ~1,022m), but extensive fieldwork around this highest area has not revealed the presence of any resident grasshopper-warblers (

19
, 
49

).
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
must be a rare bird: Taliabu’s area above 1,050m amounts to ~16,690 ha of formerly forested land in the interior of the island’s western half, over 97% of which forms one contiguous block (

). However, satellite imagery predominantly from 2004 indicates that a total of ~1,023 ha (~6.1%) of this area had been affected by logging operations that have degraded the forest and removed its undercover, presumably rendering the affected areas unsuitable, or nearly so, for the grasshopper-warbler. In the one-and-a-half decades since the satellite images were obtained, extensive additional logging is likely to have occurred. Another 940 ha (~5.6%) of the area above 1,050m have succumbed to a series of catastrophic forest fires in 1982 and 1983, and now constitute open grassland habitat unsuitable for this warbler (

). Our surveys showed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
does not occur in the extensive recently generated grasslands in the highlands of Taliabu (

48

). This leaves 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
with less than 15,000 ha of suitable habitat, an area likely to further diminish in size with ongoing habitat destruction and the impacts of global warming leading to an upward elevational shift of habitat zones.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We include this new taxon within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
following the phylogenetic demonstration that the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bradypterus
</tp:taxon-name>
(previously used for this Southeast Asian clade of warblers) is restricted to Africa (
8 1, 8 2
). Its inclusion within 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
is the reason why we follow the recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] of using the English moniker ‘grasshopper-warbler’ rather than the term ‘bush-warbler’, which is more appropriately reserved for members of a radiation in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Cettiidae</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
is renowned for its cryptic and conservative coloration that has confounded plumage-based classifications for decades and led to delays in the recognition of species-level taxa until bioacoustic and molecular methods have been applied (
8 3, 8 4
). In Wallacea, members of a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from Sulawesi and the Moluccas were previously united into a single polytypic species 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
(
6 1, 7 5
), but have recently been divided into three constituent island species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru, on the basis of their strikingly different songs (

57

). Our new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is geographically surrounded by constituents of this radiation and is a member of it both on the basis of morphological characters (see Diagnosis) and bioacoustic ones.
</p>
            <p>
Although plumage distinctions are not as important in the genus, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by comparatively unique, dark-brown upperparts that stand in contrast to the generally paler and warmer-brown upperparts of neighboring species. However, we mainly attribute species status to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on the basis of its unique song and genetic differentiation. We here provide an excerpt of ongoing analyses as relating to the bioacoustic and mitogenomic differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from neighboring species.

Bioacoustic evidence
: A total of 41 suitable, high-quality, homologous 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
song recordings from the field were gathered for analysis from various sources, encompassing all three previous species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation plus the new species. These recordings were measured for 11 suitable bioacoustic parameters, and resultant measurements were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and a conservative vocal diagnosability criterion (

85

), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Further details regarding all analyzed recordings, such as GPS locations, dates, times, and names of recordists, are listed in table S3, while more details on bioacoustic methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
Based on the Isler Criterion, eight out of eleven song parameters measured were diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and two other taxa: 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (table S4). Four out of eleven parameters were Isler-diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (table S4). The ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) can be adopted to ascertain if the level of vocal divergence between these archipelagic taxa is comparable in magnitude to divergences across unequivocal species-level divisions. When comparing Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler song against that of the Friendly Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
, a geographically distant species from montane Borneo that has never been included in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, only two parameters emerged as Isler-diagnosable (table S4). Using this result as a yardstick for what constitutes species level vocal differentiation, the magnitude of vocal divergence between Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
on Seram, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
on Buru, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on Sulawesi is extremely high, indicating they all have diagnosably distinct vocalizations that are best reflected in species rank.
</p>
            <p>
Principal component analysis of the vocal measurements underscores the vocal distinctness of Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from the other three Wallacean species (

). A cumulative proportion of variance of 73.3% is accounted for in the first two principal components, suggesting a strong vocal differentiation between Taliabu and the remaining taxa (

).
</p>
            <p>
Mitogenomic evidence
: Using whole-genome sequencing and laboratory approaches for the use of ancient DNA, we created an alignment of whole-mitochondrial sequences spanning ~15,000 base pairs (bp) across 11 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals belonging to all four constituent island forms of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, and used three different phylogenetic tree-building methodologies to investigate relationships and levels of divergence. More details on the methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
All three phylogenetic trees produced indicated identical topologies with high bootstrap support (

), suggesting that the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is an independent lineage most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (mitogenomic divergence ~2%), and much more distantly related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (divergence ~4.8–5%) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (divergence ~7.7–8%). Mitogenomic divergences roughly correlate with those from the COI barcoding gene, although they do not have to be equal in magnitude.
</p>
            <p>
Integrating the vocal and mitogenomic evidence, it is clear that bioacoustic differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, the two species which emerged most closely related on the mitogenomic tree (

), far exceed those between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and a geographically distant species (
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
) that has never been closely associated with the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. Our combined evidence therefore supports the treatment of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
as a well-diverged small-insular endemic species.

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic sampling:
We obtained 41 homologous recordings, which were either recorded by us in the field, or privately sourced from avid field ornithologists (including Robert O. Hutchinson and Ross Gallardy), or collected from publicly accessible online databases, namely the Avian Vocalization Center (AVoCet at http://avocet. integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu), the Xeno-Canto Sound Library (www.xeno-canto.org), the Macaulay Sound Library (www.macaulaylibrary.org), and the Internet Bird Collection (www.hbw.com/ibc).
</p>
            <p>Although slight variation in recording quality exists in the equipment used, inspection and comparison of spectrograms from different devices showed that this variation is comparable to that amongst recordings made by one sole recordist using the same device. In addition, although there is some variability in background noise, spectrogram inspection suggested that measurements of vocalizations would not be affected. Measurements of the recordings were performed using the program Raven Pro Version 1.5 (Bioacoustics Research Program, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA) on its default settings. The following eleven parameters were chosen for bioacoustic analysis, with each parameter averaged over all the measurements across one recording:</p>

Bioacoustic analysis:
The vocal diagnosability criterion outlined by Isler et al. (
8 5
), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, was used to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Besides other oscine passerines (
73, 8 6
), this criterion has been employed as a bioacoustic species delimitation method across Asian birds such as owls (

58
, 
87

), pigeons (

50
, 
52
, 
88

), and nightjars (

89

). The Isler criterion has two parts which must be fulfilled in order to infer diagnosability. Firstly, the range of measurements of a parameter between two taxa must not exhibit overlap, and secondly, the data have to satisfy the following equation: 
xa
+ 
taSDa ≤xb–tbSDb,
where (
x
) refers to the respective means of measurements in taxon a and b, and 
ti
refers to the t-score at the 95th percentile of the t distribution for 
n-1
degrees of freedom. This is a stricter statistical test than the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (
8 5
) as it employs the standard deviation of the sample points instead of the taxon mean, allowing for the diagnosis of distinctions between taxa under more rigorous conditions. Successful Isler diagnosability is defined here as the presence of at least one vocally diagnostic parameter between taxa.

DNA extraction methods:
Fresh tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
was DNA- sequenced along with the following number of toepad scrapings of historical museum specimens: three of the Buru Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, three of the Seram Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and four of the Sulawesi Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
. All museum samples had been kindly contributed by the American Museum of Natural History (for voucher numbers, see 

and table S5). DNA extraction was carried out with the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extraction of the historic museum specimens’ toepad scrapings was conducted by trained personnel (CYG) in a room dedicated to ancient DNA extraction to preclude DNA contamination. The toepads were rinsed with water four times before extraction to ensure preservatives were removed, and DTT was added to facilitate digestion of keratin present in toepads. The concentrations of the DNA extracts were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay.
</p>
            <p>
DNA sequencing methods:
The holotype’s DNA extract was sheared into smaller fragments of ~250 base pairs (bp) using 13 cycles of 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off on a Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode, USA). Whole-genome library preparation for the holotype was carried out using a NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, USA) for Illumina according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the museum toepad extracts, the shearing step was omitted as the ancient DNA is already degraded and NEBNext FFPE DNA repair mix (New England Biolabs, USA) was added to each ancient DNA sample prior to library preparation to fix damage common to degraded DNA such as deamination, nicks and gaps. In addition, size selection of library preparation products was omitted for the toepad samples to reduce DNA loss from bead selection. A total of five PCR cycles were run on the holotype’s DNA extract and 12 PCR cycles on the toepads’ extracts. Whole-genome library preparation of toepad samples was carried out in a room with a PCR hood dedicated to ancient library preparation work. The concentrations and peak fragment sizes of the libraries were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay and an Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer (Agilent, USA), respectively. The peak fragment sizes of the historic museum samples and the fresh holotype (including adaptors and unique indexes) were ~230bp and ~380bp, respectively. All prepared libraries were sent to NovogeneAIT Genomics Singapore for Illumina sequencing using a HiSeq 4000 platform to produce 150bp paired-end reads.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial genome alignment
: Trimmomatic (version 0.33) (

90

) was used to remove adaptors and filter low quality reads (below 15 Phred quality score). We applied the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (version 0.7.15-r1140) (
9 1
) to align reads to a mitochondrial reference genome, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella pryeri
</tp:taxon-name>
(Genbank accession no.: NC_029151), with a minimum mapping quality score of 30. Samtools (version 1.9) (
9 2, 9 3
) was run to convert the SAM output files from the alignment to a BAM format for downstream analysis. Then Picard (version 2.18.21; http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) was employed to insert read groups and remove PCR duplicate artifacts. The BAM files were then imported into CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0.4 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com) for remapping to the same reference genome using the following mapping parameters: mismatch penalty of 1, insertion penalty of 1, and deletion penalty of 1. The reads were locally realigned at indel regions, and the consensus sequences were extracted at a minimum coverage threshold of 100. A mapping summary produced by Qualimap (version 2.2.1) (
9 4
) indicated that our mitochondrial genome coverage ranged between ~290–2920x for museum samples and ~6430x for the holotype (table S5). Sequences are deposited with GenBank at accession numbers 
MN597052
- 
MN597062
.
</p>
            <p>
Phylogenetic analysis
: The consensus sequences were exported in FASTA format and visually realigned in MEGA7 (

95

), producing a final whole-mitochondrial alignment of ~15,000bp. MEGA7 was used to construct a neighbor-joining tree based on uncorrected p- divergences and a maximum parsimony tree. Additionally, we ran raxmlGUI 1.5 beta (

96

) to construct a maximum likelihood tree using the GTRGAMMA model as specified by jModelTest (version 2.1.7) (

97

). All tree-building analyses were conducted with 10,000 bootstrap replicates. Pairwise uncorrected p-divergences across the mitogenomic alignment were calculated in MEGA7 with 10,000 bootstrap replicates.

            <p>Head and mantle down to uppertail coverts and to central belly are bright scarlet-red (7.5R 4/14) with subtle blackish suffusion owing to individual feathers having broad red distal half followed by black and then increasingly greyish basal half; jet-black narrow orbital ring and loral line. Upperwings, sides of mantle, scapulars and rectrices are matt black, with the remiges appearing slightly duskier black because of narrow olive edging to outer webs; underwing coverts and outer webs of the underside of remiges are whitish; a blackish-grey (N1.5) wedge extends from vent up to central belly.

The diagnosis refers to the adult male plumage only. Female 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals of the Wallacean radiation are generally very similar across species, and more research is needed to identify good distinguishing marks.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is an obvious, bright scarlet-and-black representative of the Wallacean grouping of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters that have often been united within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
complex (
6 1, 7 5
), but have been considered a radiation of independent species by more recent authors [e.g. (

57

)]. Within this radiation, the new species most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species has a more extensive and brighter red body and blacker wings, scapulars, and tail. Scarlet feathers in the new species are mostly black and grey at the base, with only the distal half scarlet, and with a sharp contrast between scarlet and black, lacking 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
’s narrow yellow bands in between the red and black portions of each individual feather that render the latter’s overall body more orange-tinted. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the red is not as extensive on the underparts, and the abdomen and vent are paler buff-white versus blackish-grey in the new species.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species is paler and greyer (not black) on vent and abdomen. It also has a smudgier scarlet body coloration (caused by the black and grey basal halves of individual feathers), with dark smudges especially pronounced on face and on breast sides, as compared to more uniform red underparts, head and mantle in 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
. Black lores in the new species are wider and not as clearly delimited as in 
<tp:taxon-name>

.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis

Etymology

</p>
            <p>We name this species after the village of Wahe (1.716°S, 124.843°E), which is the gateway to the highest elevations on Taliabu where it most commonly occurs. The species epithet is an indeclinable noun in apposition.</p>

Individual, age-related and sexual variation within taxon

</p>
            <p>
Two adult male specimens (holotype and 34.356) are virtually identical in coloration. Two additional male specimens (34.373 and 34.403), most likely immatures, are similar but have the scarlet body color replaced with a more rose-red hue (5R 4/14); they also do not exhibit any distinct olive margins of remiges. No comparative specimen material exists for adult females of the new species, which are generally similar among all regional 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species. Photos confirm that the female of the new species resembles other regional species (data not shown). One juvenile specimen (34.407) lacks red coloration and is generally drab grayish-brown (paler on underparts), becoming more intense earthen-brown on the mantle, rump and upperwing coverts, with the underside of remiges and rectrices mid-grey.

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
was first spotted by a University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 led by P.J. Davidson. Participants of this exploratory survey were probably the first ornithologists to visit the highlands of Taliabu between 600-800 m elevation (
64, 9 8
), where they found the new species predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m). FER then encountered the species commonly during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu between 4-18 April 2009 (

19
, 
48

), where we returned between 6-16 December 2013 to collect the holotype and accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has thus far only been found on the island of Taliabu within the Sula Archipelago. On Taliabu, we have recorded it from sea level to 1,300m (

19
, 
48

), and it presumably occurs further up all the way to the highest elevation at ~1,415m. The species inhabits forest canopy and edge habitat, and is a nectarivore and frugivore that has been photographed feeding at flowers (

48

). Akin to multiple other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species in Wallacea (

57

), the new species is seen far more often at higher elevations (roughly above ~800m) than in the lowlands. Davidson et al. (

64

), who first sighted this species, exclusively found it at higher elevations, mostly around ~800m, and we recorded it as “abundant” above 800m, whereas we have only had a handful of sightings in the lowlands. It is unknown to what extent elevational differences in abundance reflect the difficulty of detecting a canopy bird in tall lowland forest as compared to stunted montane forest. However, although detection difficulties may help mask its true abundance in the lowlands, we do not believe it is possible for the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
to be equally common across elevations given that other small canopy birds do not escape detection in the lowlands and are recorded commonly. In fact, the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
may even be a breeding endemic to montane elevations and only venture into the lowlands seasonally, following tree flowering and fruiting events. This potential seasonal displacement would explain why some expeditions have completely overlooked it in the lowlands while others have recorded it on occasion.
</p>
            <p>
It is contentious whether the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
is endemic to Taliabu, or also occurs on the other two main islands of the Sula Archipelago (Mangole and Sanana). The latter two have received even less ornithological attention than Taliabu, and to the best of our knowledge, the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has never been recorded there on recent ornithological expeditions (D. Yong, pers. comm.; J.A. Eaton, pers. comm.). Sanana is relatively low-lying (up to ~600m) and therefore likely to lack a number of Taliabu’s montane species. Mangole reaches its highest peak at 1,127m, but areas above 800m are confined to ~328 ha only, which gives it a comparatively small area of true montane forest. The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
’s level of dependence on vegetation at high elevations probably determines whether it would be capable of occurring on Mangole or even Sanana. Future fieldwork on those two islands will shed light on whether the new species occurs there or not.
</p>
            <p>
FER and Filip Verbelen first discovered a new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
population in the mountains of Peleng in the neighboring Banggai Archipelago during a visit between 23-30 March 2009 and recorded it as reasonably common at elevations between 700-900m in the western Peleng highlands (

49

). On our collecting expedition, we only had one aural encounter of this 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
on Peleng on 21 Dec 2013, indicating that the population might have been seasonally displaced or more retiring (

19

). However, photographic evidence from the 2009 visit indicates that the Peleng population has a plumage coloration that is very similar – if not identical – to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and quite different from 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
. As this Peleng population remains uncollected, future fieldwork will hopefully produce specimens allowing a determination whether there are differences between the Peleng birds and 
<tp:taxon-name>

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu is obviously a member of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, which used to be considered a single wide-ranging polytypic species for a long time (
6 1, 7 5
), but has now been divided into multiple monotypic island endemics by most recent authors on the basis of extensive plumage differences [e.g. (
57, 8 0, 99
)]. Within this radiation, its plumage most closely resembles that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, but is discrete from both of them in multiple characters (see Diagnosis). Its morphological differences from both 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
exceed those between other closely related species pairs within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. dammermani
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
(

73

). Therefore, its diagnosis here as a species level taxon rests on Mayr and Ashlock’s (

70

) yardstick approach, by which species status is conferred on the basis of divergences that exceed those of species pairs in which biologically important differences have been unequivocally demonstrated.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters have a wide vocal repertoire that is oftentimes problematic in the context of bioacoustic analysis (

73

). The Taliabu 
<tp:taxon-name>Myzomela</tp:taxon-name>
was hardly vocal during our encounters, and we do not consider vocalizations a fruitful taxonomic avenue in delimiting this new species from others. Instead, we have generated mitochondrial sequence data to further shed light on the new species’ taxonomic status.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial evidence
: Our mitochondrial tree analysis was based on sequences of the coding gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), comparing 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
to a great majority of members of the eastern and central Indonesian radiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters. Results indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
is most closely related to geographically adjacent species such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (

). Our analysis does not provide resolution on whether either 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
constitute the sister species to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
, and in fact, the latter two may well be sister to each other instead (

), rendering 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
a more basal species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from adjacent Buru is not represented in our mitochondrial dataset, and likely forms part of this group. Based on plumage coloration, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
is frequently considered to constitute the sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, and the two are sometimes merged under one species [e.g. (

99

)]. Therefore, we assume that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
– albeit closely related – will probably not emerge as the direct sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
in future analyses.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial ND2 divergence values between 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
and its two most closely related relatives (

<tp:taxon-name>M. elisabethae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chloroptera</tp:taxon-name>

) range between 3.5%–4.3% (

), well above the mitochondrial divergence threshold of 2-3% widely postulated in the literature (
10 0, 10 1
), providing additional support for species level recognition of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial analysis:
We extracted DNA from the breast muscle tissue of all our 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
material (n = 5), and from four independently collected 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
samples (

73

), using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. ND2 was then sequenced following Lim et al. (
10 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Using CodonCode Aligner version 8.0.2. (CodonCode, USA), our ND2 sequences were trimmed and assembled. These sequences of 991 bp length were then aligned in MEGA7 (
9 5
) with the ND2 sequences of 23 other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>The crown (from forehead to nape) is cold brown (2.5Y 2/2), delimited below by a narrow long white supercilium from bill base to napeside. Lores dark greyish brown (2.5Y 3/1) extending to just behind eye in the form of an eyestripe cutting through a broken white eye ring formed by small feathers peripheral to the eye. Black rictal bristles. Ear coverts and malar, facial and moustachial regions show white-and-dusky grizzling. Most of upperparts, including mantle, scapulars and rump, are mid-olive (5Y 4/4), while remiges are distinctly darker-olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). The white chin and throat are characterized by sporadic dusky speckles and lemon streaks increasing towards the lower throat, and grading into a fully lemon to sulphur yellow breast and belly (5Y 9/12). The yellow on the breast and belly has an olive-mottled appearance because of olive feather tips (5Y 4/4), especially pronounced towards the flanks, and white feather bases, especially pronounced towards the abdomen. The vent is solid lemon-yellow (5Y8/7). Iris dark-brown; bill black. Tarsus, toes and claws pinkish-grey with toepads paler yellowish.</p>

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The new species name is derived from “suara merdu” in Bahasa Indonesia, translating as “melodious voice”, referring to the pleasing vocalizations of this bird that FER heard hours before the first individual was seen, allowing for predictions prior to visual confirmation that this would be a new

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
During a visit to the highlands of Peleng between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently encountered this species at elevations between 700-900m (

49

). When hiking up to these elevations for the first time and hearing the melodious warble of this taxon in the distance, its superficial vocal resemblance to other members of the Wallacean 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation prompted FER to predict that this would be a new leaf-warbler taxon long before they laid their eyes on it. Once they first saw it, it was noticeable for its unusual behavior of frequently climbing along larger branches and trunks of trees in the manner of a treecreeper (
<tp:taxon-name>
Certhia
</tp:taxon-name>
). On our collecting expedition to Peleng between 18-23 Dec 2013, the species was less commonly encountered (

19

), probably because of seasonality.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new leaf-warbler is restricted to the highland forests of western Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago at elevations above 700m, reaching the highest island altitude above 1000m (

). Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago must be in serious doubt because only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, of which only 5 ha of land lie above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. Beyond the Banggai Archipelago,

Lemon ear coverts down to malar and moustachial regions (5Y 9/10) grizzled with dusky-olive feather edging, making for a mottled facial appearance. Upperparts from mantle and scapulars to rump are mid-olive (7.5Y 4/6). Remiges are distinctly darker- olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). Underparts from chin to vent are largely lemon to sulphur yellow, with white feather bases creating a more lemon-yellow hue on throat, breast and belly (7.5Y 8/8) and olive feather tips (5Y 4/4) generating a more olive- mottled appearance on flanks, while the undertail coverts are largely uniform lemon (5Y 9/12).</p>

<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
A University of East Anglia expedition by Davidson et al. (

64

) was the first to find a resident population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers on Taliabu, which they encountered commonly in montane forest and which they considered to represent an undescribed taxon. Rheindt (

48

) then studied this leaf warbler during his visit between 4-18 April 2009, and we found them again during our expedition between 6-16 Dec 2 013 and collected two (

19

).

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>
Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new warbler inhabits disturbed and undisturbed montane forest on Taliabu from 700m up to probably the highest elevations above 1,400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). It may also occur on the large neighboring island of Mangole, which rises to 1,127m and should harbor enough area of montane forest habitat above 700m to sustain a population. However, a lack of fieldwork in the mountains of Mangole means that there is no information available on its montane avifauna. The smallest main constituent of the Sula Archipelago, the densely populated island of Sanana, is unlikely to sustain any 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers as it barely reaches above 600m, which seems to be too low for this species. The species is replaced on the Banggai Archipelago by the newly described 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
(see SM5), while 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
replace it in various parts of Sulawesi. Given its more relaxed elevational requirements and its tolerance for disturbed habitat, this species is probably not as immediately endangered as some of the other montane Taliabu avifauna.

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
)


</p>
            <p>
The leaf-warbler genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
constitutes a large Old World radiation of small passerines that is exceptionally well-studied in phylogenetic terms (
10 6-1 09
). Recent demonstrations of genus paraphyly in combination with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
[summarized in (
10 8
)] have prompted a variety of new generic treatments, including a division into two re-defined genera [
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
; see (

57

)], but we here follow the latest phylogenetic treatise that suggests a merger of all 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
into a single genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
10 8
).
</p>
            <p>
Despite the genus’s well-known evolutionary history, a sizeable sub-clade of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Australasian (including Indonesian) Archipelago has largely been omitted from modern molecular insights. Notable exceptions include the first-ever example of a new avian species description (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. rotiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) partly based on genome-wide DNA data from the Timor region (
11 0
). However, most island populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
in this region have been merged into a limited number of ‘wastebasket species’, e.g. Mountain Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trivirgatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and Island Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
, although vocal and plumage differences among them often far exceed those documented among the better- studied continental groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
8 0
). As a consequence, some modern treatments [e.g. (

57

)] have adopted a ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) in which pairwise plumage and vocal differences between archipelagic taxa that are comparable in magnitude to those between better-studied continental species pairs (or exceed them) are interpreted as being indicative of species status. In this way, a number of highly distinct island taxa have been elevated to species level, such as Buru Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. everetti
, Seram Leaf Warbler
</tp:taxon-name>
               <tp:taxon-name>
P. ceramensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[a treatment that had previously been suggested on the basis of vocal and plumage comparisons; see (

80

)], and a number of additional Wallacean taxa. Our description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
follows this framework of affording species rank to taxa when vocal and plumage characters indicate deeper divisions. We also bring genome-wide DNA data to bear on the taxonomic classification of these two new species. However, following the yardstick approach as applied under the Biological Species Concept, we believe that biological characters, especially bioacoustic ones, will be the most important indicators when conferring species status in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers.
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: As for plumage characters, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
differ from each other and from surrounding taxa in a number of important traits (see Diagnosis for each taxon) which are far more salient than the plumage differences of often identical-looking species pairs on the Asian continent that are otherwise vocally and phylogenetically deeply diverged [e.g. the three members of the Arctic Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. borealis
</tp:taxon-name>
trio; (
11 1
)]. Most importantly, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
has a contrastingly white throat and supercilium and a grey-and-white grizzled auricular patch where all other surrounding taxa are much more yellowish, rendering it instantly recognizable in large series of specimens. In contrast, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is superficially reminiscent of Sulawesi Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
in its overall more yellowish coloration, displaying a phenotypic leapfrog pattern that has been documented from the Taliabu-Peleng-Sulawesi island trio on multiple previous occasions (
50, 7 2
). However, this superficial resemblance notwithstanding, it has important distinctions in bare-parts coloration and overall pigmentation (see Diagnosis), apart from obvious vocal differences.

Bioacoustic evidence
: In bioacoustic terms, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by melodious jumbles of 1–1.5sec, mostly at 2000–6000 Hz, with short individual high notes between 5000–7000 Hz occasionally interspersed. Song motifs generally lack repetitive element sequences or trills (

). In contrast, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by 1.5–3sec strophes mostly between 2000–6500 Hz (typically of a wider frequency range than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
) that constitute a melodious jumble often followed by a final repetitive phrase, which can sometimes be omitted (

). In this respect, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is slightly more reminiscent of the East Sulawesi population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng (despite the geographic proximity of the latter two). The 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
population on Gunung Tumpu (East Sulawesi) is often characterized by strong repetitive series at a very broad frequency range (2500–7000 Hz), mostly preceded by a variable but simple melodious series of elements between 2000–5000 Hz and a brief nasal note separating this variable series from the repetitive series (

). Depending on the presence or absence of components, the song rendition (=motif) can be 1.5–4sec long. In summary, the songs of these three forms (

<tp:taxon-name>P. suaramerdu</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. emilsalimi</tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
), while highly variable, are predictably different and strongly indicative of species status when put into the context of song differences among other 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
species (

).

Genomic evidence
: We generated a set of ~4,100 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment spanning almost 3 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial cytochrome- 
b
(cyt- 
b
) sequences, to shed light on the differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in separate Methods paragraphs below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three taxa (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
from East Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population-genomic space based on ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (

). The main division according to genomic PCA occurred between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
versus the other two taxa (PC1 in 

). The same relationship was strongly reflected in maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of concatenated genome-wide sequence alignments of almost 3 million base pairs length as well as in maximum-parsimony (MP) analysis of a concatenated set of ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (topology 1 in 

). In contrast, mitochondrial cyt- 
b
gene analysis and species-tree inference of genome-wide SNPs recovered a topology in which 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
were strongly supported sister lineages, with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
being more basal (topology 2 in 

). Depths of uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence (as determined by cyt- 
b
distances) were comparatively low across all three leaf-warblers (0.7-1.6%; 

).
</p>
            <p>
In summary, our phylogenomic analyses demonstrated considerable incongruence among tree topologies, including a strong mito-nuclear discordance that calls into doubt the reliability of mitochondrial divergence values in this dataset. For instance, the deepest genomic divergence was detected between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other two species (PC1 in 

), whereas on mitochondrial cyt- 
b
evidence 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
displayed some of the most shallow divergences from the other taxa (

). The use of mitochondrial divergences in species delimitation suffers from multiple confounding biases (
79, 10 0, 10 1
), especially when dealing with complexes containing closely-allied allopatric taxa that have a propensity for secondary gene flow (
11 2-11 4
). The best explanatory hypothesis for the pronounced mito- nuclear discordance in this dataset is that occasional overwater dispersal followed by hybridization and gene flow may have led to the introgression of foreign alleles in one or the other species, obfuscating clean branching patterns. Gene flow during sporadic hybridization is known to artifactually reduce mitochondrial divergences, masking deeper levels of genomic differentiation (

79

). Hence, introgression can account for the presence of relatively low mitochondrial divergences in a group of species characterized by comparatively deep genomic divergences and pronounced levels of bioacoustic differentiation [(

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted DNA from the fresh muscle tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and the three specimens collected by us (including the holotype) of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
, along with one individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
that we had collected on Mt Tumpu on the eastern peninsula of Sulawesi (

19

). Additional tissue samples were obtained from the American Museum of Natural History, New York (AMNH): three samples of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
from South Sulawesi and an outgroup sample of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus pallescens
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Solomon Islands. The AMNH samples were only used for phylogenomic rooting. DNA extraction was performed using the Exgene Clinic SV kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul) following the manufacturer’s instructions. We eluted the DNA in two consecutive rounds of 100μl molecular grade water. We prepared double-digest restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing (ddRADSeq) libraries using the same protocol as Garg et al. (
11 5
) with EcoRI and MspI as restriction enzymes. We quantified DNA and library product concentrations using the Qubit 2.0 Broad Range DNA Assay (Invitrogen, California), and used a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Iowa) to perform final quality checks on the library product. The genomic libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform at the Singapore Center for Environmental Life Science Engineering. Filtering and demultiplexing of the genomic data in STACKS 1.34 followed the same general procedures as detailed by Ng et al. (
7 2
), and are the result of comprehensive trials using a wide variety of different parameters and settings at each step of the analysis. DNA data is deposited with Genbank at BioProject accession number PRJNA566263.
</p>
            <p>
SNP calling and genomic supermatrix generation:
Reference genome alignment was performed using BWA 0.7.12 (
9 1
) and samtools 0.1.19 (http://samtools.sourceforge.net) (
9 2, 9 3
) on the Greenish Warbler (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
) genome (
11 6
), the most closely related available full genome. We performed SNP calling in STACKS 1.34 as per Ng et al. (
7 2
). We required loci to be present across all individuals, and retained one random SNP per locus to exclude obviously linked SNP loci. Subsequently, we used PLINK 1.9 (
11 7
) and Bayescan 2.1 (
11 8
) to filter SNPs for linkage disequilibrium and signs of selection. Data format manipulation and conversions were performed with PGDSpider (
1 19
). The final filtered dataset totaled 4,104 SNPs. In addition, we created concatenated SNP datasets for each group for use in downstream maximum parsimony analysis.
</p>
            <p>
Following the procedures used by Ng et al. (
7 2
), we generated a concatenated read supermatrix without missing data using pyRAD (
12 0
). We stipulated a minimum required locus coverage of 20, and kept the clustering threshold within and between reads at the default of 0.88. The final concatenated read supermatrix amounted to 2,861,661 bp in length, generated from 19,985 loci.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial sequence generation:
We sequenced cyt- 
b
using the primers H16065 (
12 1
) and L14995 (
12 2
), with 40 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 72°C. We conducted PCR product cleanup with ExoSAP-IT 
®
and used the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) for cycle- sequencing. Sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer using capillary electrophoresis. We assembled cyt- 
b
sequences with CodonCode Aligner 4.1 and aligned them with ClustalW (
12 3
). The final cyt- 
b
alignment was 1,100bp long, indel- free and fully translatable. Mitochondrial sequences have been deposited with Genbank at accession numbers 
MN518858
- 
MN518862
.
</p>
            <p>
Population structure inference:
In order to test for the presence of geographic structuring across East Sulawesi, Peleng, and Taliabu, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the genomic SNP data. PCA was performed using ade4 (
12 4
) and factoextra (
12 5
), both available as R packages (
12 6
).
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial tree inference:
We constructed phylogenetic cyt- 
b
trees using two methods: maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML). We ran MP analyses using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
), performing 10,000 bootstrap replicates. For ML analyses, we first used jModelTest v2.1.6 (

97

) and determined that the Jukes-Cantor model (
12 8
) was the best performing substitution model. We then ran RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) using the extensive subtree-pruning-regrafting tree search algorithm.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic tree inference:
We applied three different genomic tree inference analyses: coalescent-based species tree inference (applied to the SNP dataset), maximum likelihood tree inference (applied to concatenated read supermatrix), and maximum parsimony tree inference (applied to the concatenated SNP dataset). We performed species tree inference using SNAPP (
1 29
) as implemented in BEAST 2.3.0, performing two iterations using default settings. Tracer 1.6 was used after each iteration to ensure that the runs had reached convergence, after which LogCombiner v2.3.0 and DensiTree (
13 0
) were used to process results. We carried out ML tree inference using RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) on the concatenated read supermatrix using the general-time-reversible gamma-invariant (GTRGAMMA) model and performed 1,000 rapid bootstrap searches. Finally, we conducted conventional MP analysis on the concatenated SNPs of each taxon set, using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
) and running 10,000 bootstrap replicates to evaluate branch support.

Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts are bronzy olive (2.5Y 3/4), the remiges and rectrices slightly darker and with more coppery edging (10YR 4/6). Dull white on breast reaches to chin, with an orange-rufescent tinge (7.5YR 7/6) surrounding the breast laterally and ventrally. Yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, with a rufescent-orange suffusion to flanks (7.5YR 7/6). Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Dark-horn mandible. Yellow-orange tarsus on live bird.

One of the phenotypically most distinct subspecies of the Mountain Tailorbird or Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Uniquely among all subspecies, the new taxon has a rufescent suffusion on throat and breast, becoming especially pronounced on breast sides and auriculars (from where it grades into the rufous crown), rendering the bird’s anterior aspect much warmer-tinged than all other subspecies. The upperparts, especially upper wings, are also warmer bronzy and the flanks tinged more rufescent than all other subspecies, making this the most reddish-looking taxon in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. It additionally differs from most other subspecies (except those from Sulawesi and Peleng) in the rufous crown’s more posterior extension to the nape and in the absence of a pale supercilium.
</p>
            <p>
It further differs from

(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis

malayanus

riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow on belly and lower breast (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near- complete absence of yellow, respectively). For additional differences from the new subspecies on Peleng, see SM8.

Davidson et al. (

<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoiler (then called an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird) for Taliabu, and characterized the population as inhabiting montane forest above 500m and possibly in need of taxonomic description. FER found this population commonly in disturbed montane forest to over 1,100 m, with a few records in dense secondary bamboo thickets down to 50m (

48

), and our collecting expedition re-encountered this form abundantly at elevations around 1,300m (

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, this new subspecies is currently only known from Taliabu in the Sula Archipelago. There, it inhabits disturbed situations (forest edge, bamboo thickets) mostly in the mountains, with the highest record at 1300m, but presumably ranging to the highest point at over 1400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). On other islands, mountain leaftoilers rarely range lower than ~500m (

57

), but Rheindt (

48

) exceptionally recorded the new taxon on Taliabu from an extensive bamboo thicket at ~50m, demonstrating that this population may tolerate lower elevations. The presence of this leaftoiler on the other two main Sula islands, Mangole and Sanana, is likely, especially on the former, which rises to over 1,100m, but perhaps also on the latter, which reaches to a little over 600m. However, it has probably been overlooked owing to a lack of fieldwork at higher elevations on these two islands. On the Banggai Archipelago, the species is represented by another novel subspecies (see below) that replaces 
sulanus
there. Its predilection for disturbed forest situations and wide elevational tolerance as compared to other insular mountain birds probably means that it is currently not of conservation concern.

Crown and nape rich rufous (2.5YR 4/10), slightly darker posteriorly, and not extending as far onto the nape as in the new Taliabu subspecies (
P. c. sulanus
; see SM7). Short blackish eyestripe. Facial region from auriculars to lores dusky-grey (N3) with an increasing rufous suffusion (concolorous with crown) towards the malar and moustachial regions. Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts olive with a slight bronzy hue (5Y 3/4), colder-colored than in the new subspecies from Taliabu (
P. c. sulanus
). Remiges and rectrices are darker and duskier, but with outer edging nearly concolorous with mantle. Underparts are bicolored, with a white chin to breast, and a lemon-yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, and with a dusky olive suffusion on the flanks. Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Tarsus dark-yellow. On the live bird, the upper mandible was black with a yellow tip, and the lower mandible was black with a yellow base and tip. The iris color was not clearly discerned on the live bird.

            <p>
A distinct new subspecies of Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(or ‘Mountain Tailorbird’), differing from adjacent subspecies to the east and to the west in important discrete characters.
</p>
            <p>
The lack of a supercilium and the posterior extension of the rufous crown coloration onto the mid-nape set this subspecies apart from most other subspecies, except those from Sulawesi and Taliabu, which have an equally or sometimes even slightly more extensive rufous crown. It further differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis
(Borneo), 
malayanus
(Malay Peninsula) and all subspecies further west and north in the absence of a strong grey hindcollar band and/or strongly grey breast sides; from 
<tp:taxon-name>
batjanensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(Bacan Island) in its lemon-yellow belly lacking a strong olive suffusion; and from 
dumasi
(Seram and Buru) in its much less brown-colored upperparts. In many aspects, the new taxon is similar to the set of subspecies on Sulawesi (
riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow belly (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near-complete absence of yellow, respectively).
</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies shares many unique traits with the new subspecies from Taliabu 
sulanus
(see SM7), but differs significantly in its darker chestnut crown and its less reddish overall appearance, largely lacking a rufescent suffusion to the breast and flanks, and showing much less rufescent on the auriculars; its flanks are also much colder olive-washed (versus warmly rufescent-washed), and the upperparts and especially upper wings are colder bronze-olive. On live birds, the legs are much darker and less intensely colorful than those of birds from Taliabu.

FER and Filip Verbelen first encountered and documented the new subspecies during a visit to the highlands of western Peleng between 22-31 March 2009 (

Typical of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers, this new taxon is restricted to forest edge situations, treefall gaps and bamboo thickets in montane forest on the island of Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago. During our combined visits to the island (

19
, 
49

), we recorded this new taxon from 750m to the highest point at over 1000m elevation. It may, therefore, not range as low as the new taxon from neighboring Taliabu, although future fieldwork may well produce lower elevational records. Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago is unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new subspecies. Despite its very small range, its predilection for disturbed forest situations probably means that it is not particularly negatively affected by the current degradation that is impacting most highland forests of western Peleng.

Taxonomic rationale (combined for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus sulanus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
P. c. relictus
)


</p>
            <p>
The Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
was previously thought to be an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird and then called Mountain Tailorbird. We here acknowledge the distant relationship to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbirds (
13 1
) and therefore follow the recent trend of calling members of this species ‘leaftoilers’ rather than tailorbirds [e.g. (

57

)], a fitting translation from their re- instated scientific genus name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
. As for the species name 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, we follow the recently proposed emendation (

6

) of the original spelling of the name (‘ 
cuculatus’
) on the basis of information in the original description showing that the name was meant to refer to the birds’ hooded appearance (from Latin cucullus – hood).
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: The new subspecies 
sulanus
from Taliabu is arguably one of the most distinctly-colored, if not the single most distinctly-colored subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(see Diagnosis) and is therefore well-deserving of subspecies status. Its reddish-suffused anterior body renders it instantly recognizable among any series of specimens. Although not as unique in morphology, we also describe 
relictus
from Peleng at the subspecific level mainly on the basis of its distinct coloration. In plumage distinctness, 
relictus
far exceeds several other previously recognized subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, such as 
P. c. cinereicollis
.
</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic evidence
: We have been unsuccessful in procuring a sufficiently large sample set of song recordings of the two new subspecies, precluding rigorous bioacoustic analysis. However, we note that the songs given by these two subspecies in the field did not strike us as very different from the songs of other subspecies we are familiar with. Song playback with recordings from several other islands elicited a ready response at least in 
P. c. relictus
. Based on our bioacoustic experience with Indonesian passerines, we do not have the impression that song differences of the two new subspecies would warrant anything but a subspecific treatment at the present time.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic evidence
: We created a set of ~8,500 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment of over 2 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase intron 2 (ND2) sequences, to investigate levels of differentiation among 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in a separate Methods paragraph below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three subspecies (
P. c. stentor
from eastern Sulawesi, 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng and 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population- genomic space (

). The main genomic division according to a PCA based on ~8,500 SNPs occurred between 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu versus the other two subspecies (PC1 in 

). In contrast to the leaf-warbler analysis (see SM6), this main genomic division among leaftoilers was also supported by the mitochondrial tree and the genomic ‘species tree’ (

), consistently placing 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng close to 
P. c. stentor
from Sulawesi, although the concatenated tree built from genome-wide loci was in conflict, placing 
P. c. relictus
closer to 
P. c. sulanus
. Coincidentally, the majority tree with a basal placement of 
sulanus
(topology 1 in 

) is also the arrangement that would be supported by the extraordinarily divergent plumage of 
sulanus
, making it unique among all leaftoiler subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
Pairwise divergences between the subspecies (as determined by ND2 distances) were relatively low (0.3-1.7%; 

), at levels generally accepted to be below the species threshold for birds [(~2-3%; (
100, 10 1
)], consistent with the current proposed subspecies status. These ND2 divergences further supported the majority tree (topology 1 in 

) by consistently rendering 
P. c. sulanus
as the most deeply diverged subspecies (up to ~1.7%), whereas 
P. c. relictus
and 
P. c. stentor
emerged as only 0.3% diverged.
</p>
            <p>
In summary, mitochondrial sequence analysis, PCA of genome-wide SNPs and ‘species-tree’ analysis all agree in placing 
P. c. sulanus
basal to the other two subspecies, an arrangement supported by its distinct plumage. Therefore, we have no reason to suspect bias in the mitochondrial divergence depth (unlike in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
, see SM6), which supports our bioacoustic assessment that both 
relictus
and 
sulanus
are at the subspecies level. Future studies of the uniquely colored 
P. c. sulanus
may yet challenge this assessment.
</p>
            <p>
Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted genomic DNA of all tissue material available for 
P. c. sulanus
(n=5) and 
P. c. relictus
(n=2), along with two samples of 
P. c. stentor
that we had independently collected on Mt Tumpu on the adjacent eastern Sulawesi peninsula (

19

). Tissue of a single individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cettia parens
</tp:taxon-name>
from Makira in the Solomon Islands, provided by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was also extracted to serve as an outgroup in phylogenomic rooting. Laboratory and analytical protocols followed our procedures outlined in SM6 (under 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
), utilizing the same reference genome (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
), but using a minimum stack depth of 5 in STACKS 1.34 and a minimum required locus coverage of 5 in pyRAD due to differences in sequencing quality. The final filtered dataset for the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers totaled 8,515 SNPs and the final concatenated read supermatrix was 2,002,726 bp long, generated from 13,194 separate loci. For mitochondrial analysis, we sequenced ND2 using the primers L5219Met and H6313Trp (
13 2
) with 35 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 50-53°C, but otherwise following the procedures as outlined in SM6. The final ND2 alignment for the leaftoilers was 1,015bp long, indel-free and fully translatable. All DNA data has been deposited with Genbank at accession number PRJNA566263 and 
MN518850

Hartert, 1920 (‘extremely neglected’) from Selayar Island, were based on the impression that the description of these birds had escaped the attention of researchers for too long. The presently described taxon, only discovered in the 21

century, fulfils that criterion even more adequately, so we take pleasure in naming it 
omississimus
(‘the most neglected’), superlative of ‘omissus’.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The immature plumage remains undocumented. The only two male specimens known to exist (holotype and MZB.Ornit.34.488) show minimal plumage variation, the only difference perhaps being the latter specimen’s slightly brighter, more brilliant rump and darker, more blackish tarsus and claws in life.</p>
            <p>As compared to males, the three female specimens have a duller blue supercilium (but still discernible), lack a black chin, have prominent rufous spectacles over a narrow blackish stripe through the cere, the rufous continuing to the lower sides of the face where it is finely speckled dark (in two of three females the speckling continues to the throat sides), and have much less dark blackish-blue auriculars, contrasting less with the rufous throat. The female’s upperparts are less brilliant blue. One of the three female specimens is slightly paler on the tarsus and claws.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new subspecies was first reported by Indrawan et al. (
13 3
), who documented the sighting of a female on 15 May 2001 and a male on 29 July 2001 at 50-100m elevation around Benteng on the main island of Togian, and pointed out that this new population may be an undescribed subspecies. Following their footsteps, Filip Verbelen (pers. comm.) made the first sound recordings of the new population in December 2008 when studying a few individuals on Kadidiri, a tiny forested tourist resort island off the coast of Togian measuring ~4km in length and less than 1km in width. A few days later, F. Verbelen moved to Batudaka, one of the three main islands of the archipelago, where he found additional individuals in coastal forest near the capital town of Wakai. FER visited Batudaka Island from 23-27 April 2009 and observed this new population. On our collecting trip, we visited Batudaka from 24-28 Dec 2013 and found this taxon to be common in the forests outside the capital town of Wakai, collecting the present material in the process (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>The new subspecies is known from the Togian Archipelago in the Gulf of Tomini, a satellite group of islands between the northern and eastern peninsulas of Sulawesi. More specifically, to the best of our knowledge the new subspecies has so far been found on the two main islands of Togian and Batudaka, as well as on the tiny islet of Kadidiri off Togian, where it is common in remnant forest and edge from near sea level to at least ~200m elevation. However, it is likely that the birds occur up to the highest elevations at ~430m on these islands. More field research is required to map this subspecies’ occurrence on other islands in this archipelago. Its presence on some of the larger, forest-covered islands in close proximity to Batudaka and Togian, such as Talatakoh, Waleakodi and Waleabahi, is virtually guaranteed, given its occurrence on tiny Kadidiri. However, its presence on slightly more distant islands, such as Puah (at ~18km from the main archipelago) and Unauna (at ~28km from the main archipelago) is less certain, although these latter islands are connected to the main archipelago by shallow sea-beds not exceeding 120m depth, indicating that they would have been connected with one another during glacial sea level recessions.</p>
            <p>
On the main island of Sulawesi, the newly described 
omississimus
is replaced by the nominate taxon 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Unusually, however, the nominate form on Sulawesi is a hill and montane forest denizen, occurring from 500-2300m elevation and shunning lowland forest habitats in stark contrast to the new subspecies.
</p>
            <p>The new subspecies appears to be moderately tolerant to habitat disturbance where small-scale timber extraction leads to a secondarization of primary forest. However, the taxon disappears where forest is converted into agricultural land. Although Togian’s forests are quickly dwindling, with most remnants by now secondary and restricted to inland locations away from the coast, far more than half of the islands should still be suitable for the new taxon, making it safe for the time being.</p>

            <p>
Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The proposed English name of this new taxon follows a recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] to call members of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
‘jungle-flycatchers’ rather than ‘blue-flycatchers’ because molecular data (
13 4
) and bioacoustic considerations (
57, 7 4
) strongly suggest a merger of many members of the previously recognized jungle-flycatcher genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinomyias
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Given that numerous species in the resultant genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
are no longer blue but entirely brown, the name ‘blue-flycatcher’, while formerly appropriate, is no longer suitable for this genus.
</p>
            <p>
Although distinguishable from other subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
in terms of plumage characters (see Diagnosis), 
omississimus
is quite similar to them in general coloration. At any rate, plumage coloration is not an ideal taxonomic indicator in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
jungle-flycatchers, many of which boast a highly conserved male plumage sporting blue upperparts and reddish underparts. Other characters, such as bioacoustic and genetic ones, may be more conducive to guiding taxonomic decision-making in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
We recently published a bioacoustic comparison on the basis of six vocal parameters among members of the greater 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, showing that the song of the newly described 
omississimus
from Togian exhibits considerable vocal overlap with the songs of all three analyzed subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
, while distinctly differing from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. kalaoensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[see 

in (
7 4
)]. This vocal evidence along with Togian’s proximity to Sulawesi suggest a placement of 
omississimus
as a subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Based on a lack of deep differentiation in both bioacoustic and genetic evidence, we propose to classify this new taxon at the subspecies level. Upon first discovery in the field, we were generally impressed by its lowland forest occurrence, which stands in contrast to the montane forest requirements of the nominate subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi. This pronounced difference in habitat preference was given much weight in supporting species- level recognition of the new Togian population in a recently published field guide to the region (

57

). However, given Gwee et al.’s (
7 4
) newly published data, the latter treatment has ultimately proved erroneous.

in its lack of solid white or rufous on the belly; its uniform dark-brown coloration in which only the underparts show a faint warm tinge; and its unmarked dark-brown vent. The new subspecies has a darker hood and breast than the above-mentioned taxa except for the intensely rufous-bellied 
fumidus
and perhaps 
hygroscopus
. It also differs from 
deningeri
from Seram in its paler, browner (less black) body color, with a darker non-contrasting hood, and differs from 
schlegelii
and 
sterlingi
(both from Timor) in its less olive overall coloration and lack of rufous belly and vent.
</p>
            <p>
Within Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely resembles the much larger and longer-winged 
versteegi
and 
papuensis
from Papua but is dark slaty-brown (versus black) in overall body color and has an unmarked vent. The lower underparts have more extensive and paler-cinnamon feather margins in the new subspecies versus narrower, more rufous feather margins in the Papuan forms.
</p>
            <p>
Among geographically more distant Island Thrush subspecies from outside of Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely approaches three taxa from the Solomon Islands (
bougainvillei, kulambangrae, sladeni)
and two taxa from the Bismarck Archipelago (
heinrothi, beehleri
), but lacks those subspecies’ blackish overall body color. It also superficially resembles 
nigrorum
from Negros (Philippines), but the latter subspecies’ lower belly grades into whitish on the vent while the new subspecies is uniformly dark on those parts. Furthermore, another Philippine subspecies, 
kelleri
from Mt Apo (Mindanao), is similar to the new subspecies but becomes darker brown towards the front of the head while the new subspecies has a nearly uniform head coloration becoming slightly paler on the forehead.

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The subspecies name, translated from Bahasa Indonesia “it likes the rain” (=suka hujan), refers to the circumstances surrounding the bird’s discovery. On FER’s first expedition to the highest parts of Taliabu (

48

), heavy persistent rain impeded bird observations, leading to a decision to abort the expedition ahead of schedule. On his premature descent, FER then spotted a hardy individual of the new thrush, perched in the pouring rain, leading him to change plans yet again and mount a subsequent second and eventually third expedition to these elevations in better weather. This latter third expedition then allowed for a more detailed documentation of Taliabu’s distinct novel montane avifauna (

19
, 
48

). The name 
sukahujan
is treated as an inalienable noun in apposition.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>All nine specimens procured resemble one another considerably in coloration. The greatest variation occurs in the tone of the lower breast and abdomen, which is intermediate in the holotype but ranges from all-drab brownish grey throughout with almost no warm edging (in MZB.Ornit.34.416) to more extensive cinnamon feather edging (in most adult females, especially MZB.Ornit.34.409), the latter leading to an overall warmer underparts impression. Females are variably slightly less slaty on upperparts and crown, and one adult individual (MZB.Ornit.34.416) of unknown sex has a male-like slaty tone on upperparts but a female- like crown color that is more suffused with dull brown. Two juveniles (MZB.Ornit.34.410; MZB.Ornit.34.417) exhibit noticeable mottling on their mantle and underparts coloration, caused by dark brownish-black feather margins contrasting against the paler (on underparts sometimes warm cinnamon) feather centers.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new taxon was first discovered on 8 and 9 April 2009 by FER near its type locality on the occasion of a hike to the highest elevations on Taliabu that was cut short by heavy rainfall. Subsequent sightings on 14 and 15 April 2009 were made in the same area on the occasion of a return visit (

48

). We found this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected the type along with the accompanying specimens.

<tp:taxon-name>
T. poliocephalus

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
With approximately 50 subspecies, the Island Thrush 
<tp:taxon-name>
Turdus poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
is arguably the most polytypic bird species on Earth (
13 5
). Attempts to separate this variable species complex into smaller species-level lineages [e.g. (
13 6
)] have been called into question by genetic data showing that plumage characters are not a good predictor of close relationships in this complex (
13 7
). Hence, modern sources generally continue to unite all or most subspecies into one polytypic species. Not unlike some Philippine subspecies previously under study (
13 7
), the new subspecies from Taliabu is phenotypically extremely different from neighboring forms but more closely resembles certain geographically distant subspecies. It is presently best accommodated at the subspecies level. Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic inquiries are needed in the future to assess whether any internal species limits must be drawn within the complex. Such future analyses may well elevate the Taliabu Island Thrush to species level. However, such analyses are currently hampered by a lack of crucial comparative DNA material.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Forehead to crown and nape dark slaty blue (2.5PB 2/2) with slightly scaly appearance generated through narrow black feather centres; the same color, but without the scaly appearance, then continues through mantle and scapulars to rump. A white supercilium starts above the centre of the eye and ends just shy of the bill base, becoming narrower towards the front. A black facial patch centred in the loral region and below the supercilium to the chin (with narrow rows of black feathers above the bill base) grades into dark slaty blue coloration (2.5PB 1.5/2) towards the auriculars and the malar and moustachial regions, merging with the nape and mantle. Upperwing coverts largely concolorous with crown, with vestiges of an extremely indistinct brighter carpal patch visible with difficulty on this specimen. Remiges are dark slaty brown (10YR 2.5/1), the larger primaries with warmer, paler outer edging (10YR 4/2). Breast intensely rufous (7.5YR 7/12), becoming slightly paler on throat and upper flanks, and becoming pale cinnamon-whitish on belly and lower flanks (7.5YR 9/4), and eventually off-white on undertail coverts. Tail dull black on upper side, blackish-grey (N2) on underside, with indistinct white base to outermost rectrices. Iris dark-brown; legs light-pink; black bill with pinkish gape flange on live bird.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
An unequivocal member of the Snowy-browed Flycatcher 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ficedula hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
, and one of its most easterly outposts, with minor plumage distinctions in the male and major plumage distinctions in the female, a combination of which conclusively demarcates this new taxon from other subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
The male subtly differs from adjacent insular subspecies to the south and to the west, namely from the two Sulawesi subspecies (
jugosae, annalisa
), from 
sumatrana
(Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo), from 
vulcani
(Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores), and from 
alifura
(Buru), in the reduction of white patches at the base of the outer tail feathers, and in the slightly less extensive rufous underparts, replaced on the belly by pale cinnamon- whitish. In contrast, males of the only subspecies to the east and north (
pallidipectus
from Bacan Island) are markedly paler on the underparts than the males of this new subspecies, and have more contrastingly olive flanks. The white supercilium in males of the new subspecies is narrower than that of at least 
sumatrana, vulcani
, and 
alifura
.
</p>
            <p>
The female is highly distinct from most subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
in her bluish (versus olive, brown or grey-brown) upperparts coloration, extensive cold-brown mottling on breast (versus little to none), and a washed-out face pattern ghosting that of the male, with a whiter (versus rufous) brow. The only other subspecies that equals female 
F. h. betinabiru
in her bluish tinge to the upperparts is 
alifura
from adjacent Buru, in which the back color is ever so slightly brighter-blue. Compared to the new subspecies, the female of 
alifura
exhibits a more rufous (less white) eye brow, and brighter and more extensive rufous underparts with less brown mottling.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>
Only adult specimens have been procured, although a photo of a 
pullus
near the nest suggests an early juvenile plumage similar to other subspecies. Among adults, tarsus color as recorded in the field on live birds appears to vary individually from light-pink to pinkish-horn.
</p>
            <p>There is minor variation among the nine adult male specimens procured in the lower extent of the rufous breast, the intensity of the cinnamon wash to the belly, thickness of the supercilium and the extent of vestigial white patches on the basal outer rectrices. There is minor variation among the five adult female specimens in the intensity of brown mottling on the underparts, width and paleness of the supercilium and the presence or absence of a slight brownish tinge to the lowermost mantle portion.</p>

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies of Snowy-browed Flycatcher was first encountered by the University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 (
64, 9 8
). Members of that survey found the new taxon predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m) and suggested that it may be a novel subspecies. FER then saw one adult male at 1100m during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu on 5 April 2009 (

48

). We returned to this general area between 6-16 December 2013, where we found 
betinabiru
as one of the most common constituents of the forest interior understorey avifauna and collected the type and accompanying individuals at ~1300m (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
Subspecies 
betinabiru
is currently only known from the understorey of dense montane forest in the highlands of Taliabu at above 800m elevation (
19, 48, 64, 9 8
). Extensive logging has occurred across the highlands of Taliabu, with some parts of the mountains additionally affected by large-scale forest fires (see Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler account in SM3; 

). As an understory inhabitant, 
betinabiru
would be particularly susceptible to this kind of habitat degradation and is therefore probably declining. Nevertheless, it remains extremely common where good habitat persists, as indicated by our high mistnet capture rates (

19

).
</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, Snowy-browed Flycatchers have not been detected on the two other main islands of the Sula Archipelago, although their occurrence is possible at least on Mangole, which rises to 1,127m, while very unlikely on Sanana, which does not rise taller than ~600m. If confirmed on Mangole, it is likely that the local population would refer to the same subspecies 
betinabiru
.
</p>
            <p>
On the adjacent Banggai Archipelago, a single Snowy-browed Flycatcher was recorded once in April 2009 at 800-900m on the tallest island of Peleng (

49

). To the best of our knowledge, there have not been subsequent records from this island despite extensive fieldwork. In the absence of photos or closer details about the single Peleng record, it is impossible to ascertain whether the Peleng population is ascribable to 
betinabiru
, to one of the two Sulawesi races (
annalisa, jugosae
) or to a novel unnamed subspecies.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We describe this new taxon on the basis of its characteristic plumage (especially in females). These plumage distinctions certainly warrant a description at the subspecific level as they exceed those of several more poorly marked subspecies within this complex (e.g. 
annalisa
[Stresemann, 1931], which only subtly differs from 
jugosae
[Riley, 1921]). Bioacoustic variation in this species complex is poorly explored, but the high-pitched courtship vocalization of the new subspecies superficially resembles that of many other subspecies, and playback of songs from other subspecies elicits a ready response from members of this population. Genetic differences between the new taxon and other subspecies remain unexplored.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Crown, nape, ear coverts and neck sides are mid-brown (7.5YR 4/2), with a distinct cinnamon-chestnut forehead extending over eye (7.5YR 4/8). Black rictal bristles. Nape color slowly grading into warmer cinnamon-rufous (2.5YR 4/10) across mantle, scapulars and rump to the basal 60% portion of tail. The outer remiges are mostly dark dusky-brown (7.5YR 2/1), becoming paler and more olive-brown (7.5YR 4/2) towards the inner remiges. All remiges have narrow but intense rufous outer edging concolorous with rump and lower back color. The wing coverts are almost identical to the inner remiges in color, with an increasing intensity and width of bright-rufous feather tipping towards the median and lesser coverts. The distal 40% of the tail is greyish-black (N2), with paler rufous tips (5YR 5/6) on the underside only. Chin and throat form a white triangle delimited below by a conspicuous large black breast patch. A diffuse band of grey coloration (N5) with a black scaly appearance created by black feathers with narrow grey edging demarcates the black breast patch on its lower side. The belly is pale buff (7.5YR 9/8), grading into a richer, fuller hue on the flanks and undertail coverts (7.5YR 5/6). The iris is dark-brown, the bill black with a pinkish base to the lower mandible, and the tarsus on the live bird was described as pinkish- horn.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A mid-sized, rufous-toned 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura
</tp:taxon-name>
typical of a radiation of fantails distributed throughout Australasia. It most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
(

57

), and constitutes the third member of this radiation. Its plumage distinctions from the other two species are subtle yet consistent. However, the most characteristic distinction is its unique courtship vocalization (
7 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, the new species differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Sula Islands in its much narrower, less distinct rufous tips to the underside of the rectrices, in its more distinct black scaling below the black breast patch, and in its more strongly cinnamon-buff (less white) central underparts. The new species’ throat is cleaner white, less interspersed with dusky tips to the feathers.
</p>
            <p>
The new species differs from all three subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi in its wider black portion of the tail and its warmer brown crown and upper mantle. When compared to the geographically most closely adjacent subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni toradja
</tp:taxon-name>
from eastern and central Sulawesi, the new species additionally differs in its cleaner white throat and slightly less conspicuous scaling below the black breast patch, while it is additionally distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
of the Lompobattang Massif in South Sulawesi by its blacker breast patch and by the richer chestnut (less cinnamon) coloration of its brighter body parts (such as supercilium, rear upperparts, flanks and vent).

Etymology

</p>
            <p>The new species’ epithet is in honor of the late Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie (deceased 11 Sep 2019), the third president of the Republic of Indonesia. President Habibie was known as a keen environmentalist and contributed greatly to the science and conservation of nature in Indonesia.</p>

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The only three specimens (all adult; one female, two males) exhibit limited variation in terms of extent of breast patch and black mottling below breast patch that may have been caused by the preparation of the specimens.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new species has doubtless been known to the local inhabitants of Peleng Island for a long time. Mochamad Indrawan was presumably the first outside ornithologist to see this new bird when encountering a dead individual during his work on Peleng in the mid-2000s and re- encountering the species in the wild on several undated occasions (

49

). During a field trip between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently observed the species near the type locality (

49

), where we returned from 18-23 Dec 2013 to collect the type and the accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new species is restricted to montane forest on the island of Peleng, the largest landmass in the Banggai Archipelago, at elevations not lower than 750m (

19
, 
49

) (

). Over two longer visits to the highlands of Peleng, we found that the species becomes gradually more common towards higher elevations before it seems to drop out somewhere slightly below the tallest peak on Peleng at 1,022m. The new species is replaced on Sulawesi to the west by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
, and on the Sula Archipelago to the east by 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Its occurrence on other islands of the Banggai Archipelago is highly unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
must be considered threatened given the small extent of its occurrence and the continuing loss of its habitat. Only 25,071 ha of land on Peleng fall above the approximate 750m elevational cutoff, most of it formerly constituting a single contiguous block of highland forest (

). However, our own observations in combination with satellite imagery indicate extensive forest loss to small-scale agriculture and logging by burgeoning village communities. Google Earth’s present coverage of the area is mixed, with large swathes covered by insufficient or outdated (e.g., 2004) imagery. However, given current satellite coverage, a conservative estimate is that 9,987 ha (~40%) from within the elevational range of

have either been completely deforested or constitute young regrowth or unviable forest fragments surrounded by clearings. This would leave only 15,084 ha of more or less undisturbed primary or older secondary forest. Recent observations indicate, however, that this extent of forest loss is probably an underestimate. After the first discovery of this species and a number of other new bird taxa on Peleng (

49

), the island became a destination for an average of 1-3 international adventure and birdwatching tour groups per year, which considerably helped spur the local economy of the village near the type locality (name withheld). While this sort of ecotourism has a positive impact on the natural environment in many reported cases, on Peleng the sudden influx of tourist dollars led to observations of increased logging and expansion of infrastructure, prompting the rapid destruction of forest at the original type locality over the last five years. In the near future, it will be of paramount importance for the survival of Peleng’s unique montane fauna to find ways in which the influx of eco-tourism dollars can create incentives for conservation.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
Based on its plumage coloration, the new species is clearly a member of the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhipidura teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, hitherto known from Sulawesi and the Sula Archipelago (

57

). The discovery of a new constituent of this radiation on the Banggai Archipelago closes the geographic gap between Sulawesi and Sula. Most previous taxonomic treatises (e.g. 
6 1, 7 5
) have regarded all members of this radiation as conspecific, and indeed plumage differences are relatively minor and have long been interpreted as consistent with a subspecific treatment. However, recent research into patterns of bioacoustic and genomic differentiation among rusty-bellied fantails from Sulawesi, Sula and Banggai has produced strong evidence in favor of species level treatment of all three island populations (
7 2
).

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="biology_ecology">
            <p>
Vocalizations
: Bioacoustically, the courtship vocalization (=song) of the new species from Peleng is the most distinct of any member of the radiation. A detailed characterization of this song has been published elsewhere (

49

). In fact, when we first found the species in the field, the bird stood out through its unusual, simple descending song that lacks the typical complex tinkling quality of its congeners (

49

). Quantitative bioacoustic comparisons revealed that the unusual vocal features of the new Peleng species have led to an acoustic leapfrog pattern in rusty-bellied fantails in which the two terminal (=easternmost and westernmost) species (i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) are more similar to each other in courtship vocalizations but are geographically divided by the new species with its unusual song (
7 2
). The great vocal distinctness of the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. habibiei
</tp:taxon-name>
is surprising because it belies its geographic proximity to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
(Sulawesi)
</tp:taxon-name>
across a combined lowland and sea gap of less than 40km and its frequent land connection to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
(Taliabu)
</tp:taxon-name>
across Pleistocene land bridges during times of global cooling (

49

). Vocal behavior is known to be an important feature in species cohesion and reproductive isolation in songbirds (
7 6, 77
), and has been shown to be more important as an indicator of species limits than plumage traits in some passerine lineages (

78

). Therefore, recent authors have accepted the unmistakable vocal uniqueness of the new Peleng fantail as an indication of its status as an undescribed new species (
57, 7 2
).

Genomic data
: In a previously published analysis (
7 2
), we conducted a comparison of&gt;11,000 genome-wide markers with a complete representation among 16 individuals spanning all three species within the rusty-bellied fantail 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. In this analysis, the new species from Peleng emerged as most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (both subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
toradja
) and less closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sula. This phylogenomic result is significant considering that – among all pairwise vocal comparisons – the greatest bioacoustic differentiation is found between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
and the new species, with strong vocal distinctions in both non-courtship vocalizations and courtship songs (
7 2
). Therefore, the relatively shallowest genomic differentiation among the three island populations corresponds to the deepest bioacoustic divergence.
</p>
            <p>
Although the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
emerged as most closely related within the radiation, comparisons of genome-wide data allow for the designation of both taxa as independent species: the basal split between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sulaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other taxa is mainly based on a genomic signal contained in ~20% of the genetic variance across study loci, whereas the second most dominant genomic signature – contained in ~14% of the genetic variance across markers – predominantly represents the deep divergence between the new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. teysmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
[

in (
7 2
)]. The presence of a significant proportion of genomic locus cohorts displaying deep differentiation between the new species and either of its two neighbors was in agreement with gene flow analyses (‘ABBA-BABA tests’) that pointed to a history of rare introgression between the new species and its neighbors (
7 2
), perhaps during episodes of unusual climate forcing dispersal between islands. Such secondary introgression is not unusual among congeneric bird species (

79

) and is not in conflict with species level treatment.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>
The entire crown from forehead to nape is rich earthen-brown (7.5YR 3/3) with slightly darker feather margins creating a scalloped appearance. A thin off-white supercilium is pronounced from bill base to just behind eye, from where it slowly tapers out. Lores are dark brownish-black (2.5Y 1.5/1). Ear coverts are of a medium earthen-brown tone (5YR 3/1) with fine pale shaft streaks giving a grizzled appearance, grading into a more greyish-brown tone (10YR 6/1) in the moustachial and malar region. The mantle and scapulars down to the uppertail coverts are largely concolorous with the crown but lack the scalloping created by darker feather margins. The remiges are mostly a rich cold dark-brown (2.5YR 2/1) but have warmer outer webs concolorous with mantle. The upperwing coverts are similarly two-toned, being mostly concolorous with mantle but some showing darker outer webs concolorous with most of remiges. As typical for the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
, the rectrices are narrow and dark- brown, very close in color to the remiges (2.5YR 2/1). The tail feathers are mostly worn, although one in the centre appears to be a new replacement.
</p>
            <p>The white chin and throat are quite sharply demarcated from the face. The lower throat and upper breast, still white, are interspersed with fine dusky speckling increasing towards the breast and lower throat sides where the color grades into a solid mid-grey (N5) with only few inconspicuous dusky speckles. The grey breast color then grades into a tawny- ochraceous belly color (7.5YR 4/6), first through tracts of grey feathers which have warm- ochraceous edging, then through tracts of largely ochraceous feathers that still have a grey feather centre, eventually to all-ochraceous feathers. The belly color becomes darker and richer on the undertail coverts and flanks (7.5YR 3/4).</p>
            <p>The bill is black with an inconspicuous paler tip. The gape on the live bird was slightly enlarged light yellow. The iris is dark brown. The tarsus and toes were described on the live bird as maroon-horn with paler, more yellowish toepads.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
A rich dark-brown forest warbler typical of the montane resident 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. As is usual across this cryptic genus, the new taxon is most conspicuous not on the basis of its plumage but its vocalizations.
</p>
            <p>
Morphologically, it is most similar in size and shape to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
of Sulawesi. However, in comparison to the new taxon, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
has less distinct speckling on the breast, has a more uniform crown that is less scalloped, paler and warmer brown upperparts, greyer underparts with brown mostly only on flanks, and has a less pointed, wider tail.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram differs in its less distinct central breast spotting, greyer (less whitish) supercilium, and more extensive grey on breast reaching further onto upper breast, neck sides and auriculars.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru differs in its much whiter breast, with off-white reaching onto mid-belly, whereas only the lower flanks and lower belly are warm-brown. Although the central breast of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
has a mid-grey tinge, its underparts are much paler than the new species’ fairly uniform grey lower breast, which grades into a fairly dark homogeneous warm-brown belly.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is quite different from the smaller 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. montis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Java. The latter is much paler cinnamon-brown on upperparts, crown and especially remiges and rectrices, and is uniformly buff-white below with extensive dark-brown speckling from chin to upper belly, lacking the new species’ grey tones on the breast and dark warm-brown tones on the belly.

The name 
<tp:taxon-name>
portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
– past participle of Latin ‘portendere’ – roughly translates as “the predicted one” or “the foretold one” and relates to the unusual circumstances of discovery when FER first heard the new warbler and recognized it to be a novel species of

multiple days before a visual confirmation was obtained.

            <p>Currently only one adult specimen is available (i.e., the holotype), and photos of up to two more adults suggest that this is probably a sexually monomorphic species with limited plumage variation.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
FER was the first person to discover 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on 9 April 2009 near its type locality when he heard an unmistakable insect-like sound that he attributed to a hitherto unnamed taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
grasshopper-warbler. Having been exposed to the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on a visit to Sulawesi only two weeks prior, and having had previous field experience with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru and Seram, respectively (
8 0
), FER was aware that the song of this population – albeit superficially reminiscent of the others – is distinct at the species level. Even so, because of the retiring nature of this bird and ill-timed heavy rain, it took FER another two hiking expeditions to the highlands of Taliabu to finally confirm on 15 April 2009 that this song was indeed uttered by what he perceived as an “unusually dark” individual of grasshopper-warbler (

48

). We encountered this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected a single specimen, now the holotype.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is presumably restricted to montane forest at the highest elevations of the island of Taliabu (

19
, 
48

) (

). All our records are from elevations above 1,050m on the more mountainous western half of the island of Taliabu, which reaches its highest altitude of ~1,415m at an unnamed peak near our collection locality (

). The new species inhabits a peculiar type of dwarf montane forest typical of these elevations.
</p>
            <p>
The occurrence of the new species on neighboring islands is highly doubtful. Of the three major islands that form the Sula archipelago, Taliabu is the largest and tallest. The smallest main island, Sanana, barely reaches above 600m elevation. The highest elevation on its larger neighbor Mangole is 1,127m – theoretically within the elevational range of this grasshopper-warbler – but the area of land above 1,050m on Mangole is only ~36 ha, which is too small an area to allow for the survival of a highly montane bird species throughout evolutionary time scales. On the neighboring Banggai archipelago, the situation is similar: the only island high enough to allow for the theoretical possibility of grasshopper-warbler breeding occurrence is Peleng (highest elevation ~1,022m), but extensive fieldwork around this highest area has not revealed the presence of any resident grasshopper-warblers (

19
, 
49

).
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
must be a rare bird: Taliabu’s area above 1,050m amounts to ~16,690 ha of formerly forested land in the interior of the island’s western half, over 97% of which forms one contiguous block (

). However, satellite imagery predominantly from 2004 indicates that a total of ~1,023 ha (~6.1%) of this area had been affected by logging operations that have degraded the forest and removed its undercover, presumably rendering the affected areas unsuitable, or nearly so, for the grasshopper-warbler. In the one-and-a-half decades since the satellite images were obtained, extensive additional logging is likely to have occurred. Another 940 ha (~5.6%) of the area above 1,050m have succumbed to a series of catastrophic forest fires in 1982 and 1983, and now constitute open grassland habitat unsuitable for this warbler (

). Our surveys showed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
does not occur in the extensive recently generated grasslands in the highlands of Taliabu (

48

). This leaves 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
with less than 15,000 ha of suitable habitat, an area likely to further diminish in size with ongoing habitat destruction and the impacts of global warming leading to an upward elevational shift of habitat zones.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We include this new taxon within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
following the phylogenetic demonstration that the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bradypterus
</tp:taxon-name>
(previously used for this Southeast Asian clade of warblers) is restricted to Africa (
8 1, 8 2
). Its inclusion within 
<tp:taxon-name>Locustellidae</tp:taxon-name>
is the reason why we follow the recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] of using the English moniker ‘grasshopper-warbler’ rather than the term ‘bush-warbler’, which is more appropriately reserved for members of a radiation in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Cettiidae</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
is renowned for its cryptic and conservative coloration that has confounded plumage-based classifications for decades and led to delays in the recognition of species-level taxa until bioacoustic and molecular methods have been applied (
8 3, 8 4
). In Wallacea, members of a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation from Sulawesi and the Moluccas were previously united into a single polytypic species 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
(
6 1, 7 5
), but have recently been divided into three constituent island species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru, on the basis of their strikingly different songs (

57

). Our new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is geographically surrounded by constituents of this radiation and is a member of it both on the basis of morphological characters (see Diagnosis) and bioacoustic ones.
</p>
            <p>
Although plumage distinctions are not as important in the genus, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by comparatively unique, dark-brown upperparts that stand in contrast to the generally paler and warmer-brown upperparts of neighboring species. However, we mainly attribute species status to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
on the basis of its unique song and genetic differentiation. We here provide an excerpt of ongoing analyses as relating to the bioacoustic and mitogenomic differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from neighboring species.

Bioacoustic evidence
: A total of 41 suitable, high-quality, homologous 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
song recordings from the field were gathered for analysis from various sources, encompassing all three previous species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation plus the new species. These recordings were measured for 11 suitable bioacoustic parameters, and resultant measurements were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and a conservative vocal diagnosability criterion (

85

), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Further details regarding all analyzed recordings, such as GPS locations, dates, times, and names of recordists, are listed in table S3, while more details on bioacoustic methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
Based on the Isler Criterion, eight out of eleven song parameters measured were diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and two other taxa: 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (table S4). Four out of eleven parameters were Isler-diagnosable between the new Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (table S4). The ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) can be adopted to ascertain if the level of vocal divergence between these archipelagic taxa is comparable in magnitude to divergences across unequivocal species-level divisions. When comparing Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler song against that of the Friendly Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
, a geographically distant species from montane Borneo that has never been included in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, only two parameters emerged as Isler-diagnosable (table S4). Using this result as a yardstick for what constitutes species level vocal differentiation, the magnitude of vocal divergence between Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
on Seram, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
on Buru, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
on Sulawesi is extremely high, indicating they all have diagnosably distinct vocalizations that are best reflected in species rank.
</p>
            <p>
Principal component analysis of the vocal measurements underscores the vocal distinctness of Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
from the other three Wallacean species (

). A cumulative proportion of variance of 73.3% is accounted for in the first two principal components, suggesting a strong vocal differentiation between Taliabu and the remaining taxa (

).
</p>
            <p>
Mitogenomic evidence
: Using whole-genome sequencing and laboratory approaches for the use of ancient DNA, we created an alignment of whole-mitochondrial sequences spanning ~15,000 base pairs (bp) across 11 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals belonging to all four constituent island forms of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, and used three different phylogenetic tree-building methodologies to investigate relationships and levels of divergence. More details on the methodology are provided below under separate Methods paragraphs.
</p>
            <p>
All three phylogenetic trees produced indicated identical topologies with high bootstrap support (

), suggesting that the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
is an independent lineage most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
from Buru (mitogenomic divergence ~2%), and much more distantly related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (divergence ~4.8–5%) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi (divergence ~7.7–8%). Mitogenomic divergences roughly correlate with those from the COI barcoding gene, although they do not have to be equal in magnitude.
</p>
            <p>
Integrating the vocal and mitogenomic evidence, it is clear that bioacoustic differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, the two species which emerged most closely related on the mitogenomic tree (

), far exceed those between 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
and a geographically distant species (
<tp:taxon-name>
L. accentor
</tp:taxon-name>
) that has never been closely associated with the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation. Our combined evidence therefore supports the treatment of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
as a well-diverged small-insular endemic species.

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic sampling:
We obtained 41 homologous recordings, which were either recorded by us in the field, or privately sourced from avid field ornithologists (including Robert O. Hutchinson and Ross Gallardy), or collected from publicly accessible online databases, namely the Avian Vocalization Center (AVoCet at http://avocet. integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu), the Xeno-Canto Sound Library (www.xeno-canto.org), the Macaulay Sound Library (www.macaulaylibrary.org), and the Internet Bird Collection (www.hbw.com/ibc).
</p>
            <p>Although slight variation in recording quality exists in the equipment used, inspection and comparison of spectrograms from different devices showed that this variation is comparable to that amongst recordings made by one sole recordist using the same device. In addition, although there is some variability in background noise, spectrogram inspection suggested that measurements of vocalizations would not be affected. Measurements of the recordings were performed using the program Raven Pro Version 1.5 (Bioacoustics Research Program, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA) on its default settings. The following eleven parameters were chosen for bioacoustic analysis, with each parameter averaged over all the measurements across one recording:</p>

Bioacoustic analysis:
The vocal diagnosability criterion outlined by Isler et al. (
8 5
), henceforth referred to as the Isler Criterion, was used to assess song diagnosability among taxa. Besides other oscine passerines (
73, 8 6
), this criterion has been employed as a bioacoustic species delimitation method across Asian birds such as owls (

58
, 
87

), pigeons (

50
, 
52
, 
88

), and nightjars (

89

). The Isler criterion has two parts which must be fulfilled in order to infer diagnosability. Firstly, the range of measurements of a parameter between two taxa must not exhibit overlap, and secondly, the data have to satisfy the following equation: 
xa
+ 
taSDa ≤xb–tbSDb,
where (
x
) refers to the respective means of measurements in taxon a and b, and 
ti
refers to the t-score at the 95th percentile of the t distribution for 
n-1
degrees of freedom. This is a stricter statistical test than the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (
8 5
) as it employs the standard deviation of the sample points instead of the taxon mean, allowing for the diagnosis of distinctions between taxa under more rigorous conditions. Successful Isler diagnosability is defined here as the presence of at least one vocally diagnostic parameter between taxa.

DNA extraction methods:
Fresh tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. portenta
</tp:taxon-name>
was DNA- sequenced along with the following number of toepad scrapings of historical museum specimens: three of the Buru Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. disturbans
</tp:taxon-name>
, three of the Seram Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. musculus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and four of the Sulawesi Grasshopper-Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. castanea
</tp:taxon-name>
. All museum samples had been kindly contributed by the American Museum of Natural History (for voucher numbers, see 

and table S5). DNA extraction was carried out with the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extraction of the historic museum specimens’ toepad scrapings was conducted by trained personnel (CYG) in a room dedicated to ancient DNA extraction to preclude DNA contamination. The toepads were rinsed with water four times before extraction to ensure preservatives were removed, and DTT was added to facilitate digestion of keratin present in toepads. The concentrations of the DNA extracts were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay.
</p>
            <p>
DNA sequencing methods:
The holotype’s DNA extract was sheared into smaller fragments of ~250 base pairs (bp) using 13 cycles of 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off on a Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode, USA). Whole-genome library preparation for the holotype was carried out using a NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, USA) for Illumina according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the museum toepad extracts, the shearing step was omitted as the ancient DNA is already degraded and NEBNext FFPE DNA repair mix (New England Biolabs, USA) was added to each ancient DNA sample prior to library preparation to fix damage common to degraded DNA such as deamination, nicks and gaps. In addition, size selection of library preparation products was omitted for the toepad samples to reduce DNA loss from bead selection. A total of five PCR cycles were run on the holotype’s DNA extract and 12 PCR cycles on the toepads’ extracts. Whole-genome library preparation of toepad samples was carried out in a room with a PCR hood dedicated to ancient library preparation work. The concentrations and peak fragment sizes of the libraries were quantified using a high-sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies, USA) assay and an Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer (Agilent, USA), respectively. The peak fragment sizes of the historic museum samples and the fresh holotype (including adaptors and unique indexes) were ~230bp and ~380bp, respectively. All prepared libraries were sent to NovogeneAIT Genomics Singapore for Illumina sequencing using a HiSeq 4000 platform to produce 150bp paired-end reads.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial genome alignment
: Trimmomatic (version 0.33) (

90

) was used to remove adaptors and filter low quality reads (below 15 Phred quality score). We applied the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (version 0.7.15-r1140) (
9 1
) to align reads to a mitochondrial reference genome, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Locustella pryeri
</tp:taxon-name>
(Genbank accession no.: NC_029151), with a minimum mapping quality score of 30. Samtools (version 1.9) (
9 2, 9 3
) was run to convert the SAM output files from the alignment to a BAM format for downstream analysis. Then Picard (version 2.18.21; http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) was employed to insert read groups and remove PCR duplicate artifacts. The BAM files were then imported into CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0.4 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com) for remapping to the same reference genome using the following mapping parameters: mismatch penalty of 1, insertion penalty of 1, and deletion penalty of 1. The reads were locally realigned at indel regions, and the consensus sequences were extracted at a minimum coverage threshold of 100. A mapping summary produced by Qualimap (version 2.2.1) (
9 4
) indicated that our mitochondrial genome coverage ranged between ~290–2920x for museum samples and ~6430x for the holotype (table S5). Sequences are deposited with GenBank at accession numbers 
MN597052
- 
MN597062
.
</p>
            <p>
Phylogenetic analysis
: The consensus sequences were exported in FASTA format and visually realigned in MEGA7 (

95

), producing a final whole-mitochondrial alignment of ~15,000bp. MEGA7 was used to construct a neighbor-joining tree based on uncorrected p- divergences and a maximum parsimony tree. Additionally, we ran raxmlGUI 1.5 beta (

96

) to construct a maximum likelihood tree using the GTRGAMMA model as specified by jModelTest (version 2.1.7) (

97

). All tree-building analyses were conducted with 10,000 bootstrap replicates. Pairwise uncorrected p-divergences across the mitogenomic alignment were calculated in MEGA7 with 10,000 bootstrap replicates.

            <p>Head and mantle down to uppertail coverts and to central belly are bright scarlet-red (7.5R 4/14) with subtle blackish suffusion owing to individual feathers having broad red distal half followed by black and then increasingly greyish basal half; jet-black narrow orbital ring and loral line. Upperwings, sides of mantle, scapulars and rectrices are matt black, with the remiges appearing slightly duskier black because of narrow olive edging to outer webs; underwing coverts and outer webs of the underside of remiges are whitish; a blackish-grey (N1.5) wedge extends from vent up to central belly.

The diagnosis refers to the adult male plumage only. Female 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
individuals of the Wallacean radiation are generally very similar across species, and more research is needed to identify good distinguishing marks.
</p>
            <p>
The new species is an obvious, bright scarlet-and-black representative of the Wallacean grouping of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters that have often been united within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
complex (
6 1, 7 5
), but have been considered a radiation of independent species by more recent authors [e.g. (

57

)]. Within this radiation, the new species most closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species has a more extensive and brighter red body and blacker wings, scapulars, and tail. Scarlet feathers in the new species are mostly black and grey at the base, with only the distal half scarlet, and with a sharp contrast between scarlet and black, lacking 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
’s narrow yellow bands in between the red and black portions of each individual feather that render the latter’s overall body more orange-tinted. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, the red is not as extensive on the underparts, and the abdomen and vent are paler buff-white versus blackish-grey in the new species.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species is paler and greyer (not black) on vent and abdomen. It also has a smudgier scarlet body coloration (caused by the black and grey basal halves of individual feathers), with dark smudges especially pronounced on face and on breast sides, as compared to more uniform red underparts, head and mantle in 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
. Black lores in the new species are wider and not as clearly delimited as in 
<tp:taxon-name>

.
</p>
            <p>
Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis

Etymology

</p>
            <p>We name this species after the village of Wahe (1.716°S, 124.843°E), which is the gateway to the highest elevations on Taliabu where it most commonly occurs. The species epithet is an indeclinable noun in apposition.</p>

Individual, age-related and sexual variation within taxon

</p>
            <p>
Two adult male specimens (holotype and 34.356) are virtually identical in coloration. Two additional male specimens (34.373 and 34.403), most likely immatures, are similar but have the scarlet body color replaced with a more rose-red hue (5R 4/14); they also do not exhibit any distinct olive margins of remiges. No comparative specimen material exists for adult females of the new species, which are generally similar among all regional 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species. Photos confirm that the female of the new species resembles other regional species (data not shown). One juvenile specimen (34.407) lacks red coloration and is generally drab grayish-brown (paler on underparts), becoming more intense earthen-brown on the mantle, rump and upperwing coverts, with the underside of remiges and rectrices mid-grey.

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
was first spotted by a University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 led by P.J. Davidson. Participants of this exploratory survey were probably the first ornithologists to visit the highlands of Taliabu between 600-800 m elevation (
64, 9 8
), where they found the new species predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m). FER then encountered the species commonly during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu between 4-18 April 2009 (

19
, 
48

), where we returned between 6-16 December 2013 to collect the holotype and accompanying individuals (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has thus far only been found on the island of Taliabu within the Sula Archipelago. On Taliabu, we have recorded it from sea level to 1,300m (

19
, 
48

), and it presumably occurs further up all the way to the highest elevation at ~1,415m. The species inhabits forest canopy and edge habitat, and is a nectarivore and frugivore that has been photographed feeding at flowers (

48

). Akin to multiple other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
species in Wallacea (

57

), the new species is seen far more often at higher elevations (roughly above ~800m) than in the lowlands. Davidson et al. (

64

), who first sighted this species, exclusively found it at higher elevations, mostly around ~800m, and we recorded it as “abundant” above 800m, whereas we have only had a handful of sightings in the lowlands. It is unknown to what extent elevational differences in abundance reflect the difficulty of detecting a canopy bird in tall lowland forest as compared to stunted montane forest. However, although detection difficulties may help mask its true abundance in the lowlands, we do not believe it is possible for the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
to be equally common across elevations given that other small canopy birds do not escape detection in the lowlands and are recorded commonly. In fact, the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
may even be a breeding endemic to montane elevations and only venture into the lowlands seasonally, following tree flowering and fruiting events. This potential seasonal displacement would explain why some expeditions have completely overlooked it in the lowlands while others have recorded it on occasion.
</p>
            <p>
It is contentious whether the new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
is endemic to Taliabu, or also occurs on the other two main islands of the Sula Archipelago (Mangole and Sanana). The latter two have received even less ornithological attention than Taliabu, and to the best of our knowledge, the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
has never been recorded there on recent ornithological expeditions (D. Yong, pers. comm.; J.A. Eaton, pers. comm.). Sanana is relatively low-lying (up to ~600m) and therefore likely to lack a number of Taliabu’s montane species. Mangole reaches its highest peak at 1,127m, but areas above 800m are confined to ~328 ha only, which gives it a comparatively small area of true montane forest. The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
’s level of dependence on vegetation at high elevations probably determines whether it would be capable of occurring on Mangole or even Sanana. Future fieldwork on those two islands will shed light on whether the new species occurs there or not.
</p>
            <p>
FER and Filip Verbelen first discovered a new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
population in the mountains of Peleng in the neighboring Banggai Archipelago during a visit between 23-30 March 2009 and recorded it as reasonably common at elevations between 700-900m in the western Peleng highlands (

49

). On our collecting expedition, we only had one aural encounter of this 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
on Peleng on 21 Dec 2013, indicating that the population might have been seasonally displaced or more retiring (

19

). However, photographic evidence from the 2009 visit indicates that the Peleng population has a plumage coloration that is very similar – if not identical – to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and quite different from 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
. As this Peleng population remains uncollected, future fieldwork will hopefully produce specimens allowing a determination whether there are differences between the Peleng birds and 
<tp:taxon-name>

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The new 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu is obviously a member of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, which used to be considered a single wide-ranging polytypic species for a long time (
6 1, 7 5
), but has now been divided into multiple monotypic island endemics by most recent authors on the basis of extensive plumage differences [e.g. (
57, 8 0, 99
)]. Within this radiation, its plumage most closely resembles that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram, but is discrete from both of them in multiple characters (see Diagnosis). Its morphological differences from both 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
exceed those between other closely related species pairs within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sanguinolenta
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. dammermani
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
(

73

). Therefore, its diagnosis here as a species level taxon rests on Mayr and Ashlock’s (

70

) yardstick approach, by which species status is conferred on the basis of divergences that exceed those of species pairs in which biologically important differences have been unequivocally demonstrated.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters have a wide vocal repertoire that is oftentimes problematic in the context of bioacoustic analysis (

73

). The Taliabu 
<tp:taxon-name>Myzomela</tp:taxon-name>
was hardly vocal during our encounters, and we do not consider vocalizations a fruitful taxonomic avenue in delimiting this new species from others. Instead, we have generated mitochondrial sequence data to further shed light on the new species’ taxonomic status.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial evidence
: Our mitochondrial tree analysis was based on sequences of the coding gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), comparing 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
to a great majority of members of the eastern and central Indonesian radiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela
</tp:taxon-name>
honeyeaters. Results indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
is most closely related to geographically adjacent species such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Seram (

). Our analysis does not provide resolution on whether either 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. chloroptera
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
constitute the sister species to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
, and in fact, the latter two may well be sister to each other instead (

), rendering 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
a more basal species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from adjacent Buru is not represented in our mitochondrial dataset, and likely forms part of this group. Based on plumage coloration, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
is frequently considered to constitute the sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. elisabethae
</tp:taxon-name>
, and the two are sometimes merged under one species [e.g. (

99

)]. Therefore, we assume that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wakoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
– albeit closely related – will probably not emerge as the direct sister species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
in future analyses.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial ND2 divergence values between 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
and its two most closely related relatives (

<tp:taxon-name>M. elisabethae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chloroptera</tp:taxon-name>

) range between 3.5%–4.3% (

), well above the mitochondrial divergence threshold of 2-3% widely postulated in the literature (
10 0, 10 1
), providing additional support for species level recognition of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial analysis:
We extracted DNA from the breast muscle tissue of all our 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela wahe
</tp:taxon-name>
material (n = 5), and from four independently collected 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myzomela irianawidodoae
</tp:taxon-name>
samples (

73

), using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. ND2 was then sequenced following Lim et al. (
10 2
).
</p>
            <p>
Using CodonCode Aligner version 8.0.2. (CodonCode, USA), our ND2 sequences were trimmed and assembled. These sequences of 991 bp length were then aligned in MEGA7 (
9 5
) with the ND2 sequences of 23 other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>The crown (from forehead to nape) is cold brown (2.5Y 2/2), delimited below by a narrow long white supercilium from bill base to napeside. Lores dark greyish brown (2.5Y 3/1) extending to just behind eye in the form of an eyestripe cutting through a broken white eye ring formed by small feathers peripheral to the eye. Black rictal bristles. Ear coverts and malar, facial and moustachial regions show white-and-dusky grizzling. Most of upperparts, including mantle, scapulars and rump, are mid-olive (5Y 4/4), while remiges are distinctly darker-olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). The white chin and throat are characterized by sporadic dusky speckles and lemon streaks increasing towards the lower throat, and grading into a fully lemon to sulphur yellow breast and belly (5Y 9/12). The yellow on the breast and belly has an olive-mottled appearance because of olive feather tips (5Y 4/4), especially pronounced towards the flanks, and white feather bases, especially pronounced towards the abdomen. The vent is solid lemon-yellow (5Y8/7). Iris dark-brown; bill black. Tarsus, toes and claws pinkish-grey with toepads paler yellowish.</p>

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The new species name is derived from “suara merdu” in Bahasa Indonesia, translating as “melodious voice”, referring to the pleasing vocalizations of this bird that FER heard hours before the first individual was seen, allowing for predictions prior to visual confirmation that this would be a new

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
During a visit to the highlands of Peleng between 23-30 March 2009, FER and Filip Verbelen frequently encountered this species at elevations between 700-900m (

49

). When hiking up to these elevations for the first time and hearing the melodious warble of this taxon in the distance, its superficial vocal resemblance to other members of the Wallacean 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation prompted FER to predict that this would be a new leaf-warbler taxon long before they laid their eyes on it. Once they first saw it, it was noticeable for its unusual behavior of frequently climbing along larger branches and trunks of trees in the manner of a treecreeper (
<tp:taxon-name>
Certhia
</tp:taxon-name>
). On our collecting expedition to Peleng between 18-23 Dec 2013, the species was less commonly encountered (

19

), probably because of seasonality.

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
This new leaf-warbler is restricted to the highland forests of western Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago at elevations above 700m, reaching the highest island altitude above 1000m (

). Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago must be in serious doubt because only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, of which only 5 ha of land lie above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new species. Beyond the Banggai Archipelago,

Lemon ear coverts down to malar and moustachial regions (5Y 9/10) grizzled with dusky-olive feather edging, making for a mottled facial appearance. Upperparts from mantle and scapulars to rump are mid-olive (7.5Y 4/6). Remiges are distinctly darker- olive (5Y 3/2) but have paler olive outer edging concolorous with mantle. Upperwing coverts have outer webs largely concolorous with mantle and inner webs concolorous with remiges. Rectrices are dark olive above (5Y 3/2) with brighter basal edging roughly concolorous with mantle, and have a more silvery sheen below (5Y 5/1). Underparts from chin to vent are largely lemon to sulphur yellow, with white feather bases creating a more lemon-yellow hue on throat, breast and belly (7.5Y 8/8) and olive feather tips (5Y 4/4) generating a more olive- mottled appearance on flanks, while the undertail coverts are largely uniform lemon (5Y 9/12).</p>

<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus

History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
A University of East Anglia expedition by Davidson et al. (

64

) was the first to find a resident population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers on Taliabu, which they encountered commonly in montane forest and which they considered to represent an undescribed taxon. Rheindt (

48

) then studied this leaf warbler during his visit between 4-18 April 2009, and we found them again during our expedition between 6-16 Dec 2 013 and collected two (

19

).

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>
Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
The new warbler inhabits disturbed and undisturbed montane forest on Taliabu from 700m up to probably the highest elevations above 1,400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). It may also occur on the large neighboring island of Mangole, which rises to 1,127m and should harbor enough area of montane forest habitat above 700m to sustain a population. However, a lack of fieldwork in the mountains of Mangole means that there is no information available on its montane avifauna. The smallest main constituent of the Sula Archipelago, the densely populated island of Sanana, is unlikely to sustain any 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers as it barely reaches above 600m, which seems to be too low for this species. The species is replaced on the Banggai Archipelago by the newly described 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
(see SM5), while 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
replace it in various parts of Sulawesi. Given its more relaxed elevational requirements and its tolerance for disturbed habitat, this species is probably not as immediately endangered as some of the other montane Taliabu avifauna.

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
)


</p>
            <p>
The leaf-warbler genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
constitutes a large Old World radiation of small passerines that is exceptionally well-studied in phylogenetic terms (
10 6-1 09
). Recent demonstrations of genus paraphyly in combination with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
[summarized in (
10 8
)] have prompted a variety of new generic treatments, including a division into two re-defined genera [
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
; see (

57

)], but we here follow the latest phylogenetic treatise that suggests a merger of all 
<tp:taxon-name>
Seicercus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
into a single genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
10 8
).
</p>
            <p>
Despite the genus’s well-known evolutionary history, a sizeable sub-clade of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Australasian (including Indonesian) Archipelago has largely been omitted from modern molecular insights. Notable exceptions include the first-ever example of a new avian species description (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. rotiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
) partly based on genome-wide DNA data from the Timor region (
11 0
). However, most island populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
in this region have been merged into a limited number of ‘wastebasket species’, e.g. Mountain Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trivirgatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and Island Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
, although vocal and plumage differences among them often far exceed those documented among the better- studied continental groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
8 0
). As a consequence, some modern treatments [e.g. (

57

)] have adopted a ‘yardstick approach’ (

70

) in which pairwise plumage and vocal differences between archipelagic taxa that are comparable in magnitude to those between better-studied continental species pairs (or exceed them) are interpreted as being indicative of species status. In this way, a number of highly distinct island taxa have been elevated to species level, such as Buru Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. everetti
, Seram Leaf Warbler
</tp:taxon-name>
               <tp:taxon-name>
P. ceramensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[a treatment that had previously been suggested on the basis of vocal and plumage comparisons; see (

80

)], and a number of additional Wallacean taxa. Our description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
follows this framework of affording species rank to taxa when vocal and plumage characters indicate deeper divisions. We also bring genome-wide DNA data to bear on the taxonomic classification of these two new species. However, following the yardstick approach as applied under the Biological Species Concept, we believe that biological characters, especially bioacoustic ones, will be the most important indicators when conferring species status in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers.
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: As for plumage characters, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
differ from each other and from surrounding taxa in a number of important traits (see Diagnosis for each taxon) which are far more salient than the plumage differences of often identical-looking species pairs on the Asian continent that are otherwise vocally and phylogenetically deeply diverged [e.g. the three members of the Arctic Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. borealis
</tp:taxon-name>
trio; (
11 1
)]. Most importantly, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
has a contrastingly white throat and supercilium and a grey-and-white grizzled auricular patch where all other surrounding taxa are much more yellowish, rendering it instantly recognizable in large series of specimens. In contrast, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is superficially reminiscent of Sulawesi Leaf Warbler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
in its overall more yellowish coloration, displaying a phenotypic leapfrog pattern that has been documented from the Taliabu-Peleng-Sulawesi island trio on multiple previous occasions (
50, 7 2
). However, this superficial resemblance notwithstanding, it has important distinctions in bare-parts coloration and overall pigmentation (see Diagnosis), apart from obvious vocal differences.

Bioacoustic evidence
: In bioacoustic terms, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by melodious jumbles of 1–1.5sec, mostly at 2000–6000 Hz, with short individual high notes between 5000–7000 Hz occasionally interspersed. Song motifs generally lack repetitive element sequences or trills (

). In contrast, the song of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by 1.5–3sec strophes mostly between 2000–6500 Hz (typically of a wider frequency range than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
) that constitute a melodious jumble often followed by a final repetitive phrase, which can sometimes be omitted (

). In this respect, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
is slightly more reminiscent of the East Sulawesi population of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
than 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng (despite the geographic proximity of the latter two). The 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
population on Gunung Tumpu (East Sulawesi) is often characterized by strong repetitive series at a very broad frequency range (2500–7000 Hz), mostly preceded by a variable but simple melodious series of elements between 2000–5000 Hz and a brief nasal note separating this variable series from the repetitive series (

). Depending on the presence or absence of components, the song rendition (=motif) can be 1.5–4sec long. In summary, the songs of these three forms (

<tp:taxon-name>P. suaramerdu</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. emilsalimi</tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
), while highly variable, are predictably different and strongly indicative of species status when put into the context of song differences among other 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
species (

).

Genomic evidence
: We generated a set of ~4,100 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment spanning almost 3 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial cytochrome- 
b
(cyt- 
b
) sequences, to shed light on the differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf-warblers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in separate Methods paragraphs below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three taxa (
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
from East Sulawesi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
from Peleng and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population-genomic space based on ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (

). The main division according to genomic PCA occurred between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
versus the other two taxa (PC1 in 

). The same relationship was strongly reflected in maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of concatenated genome-wide sequence alignments of almost 3 million base pairs length as well as in maximum-parsimony (MP) analysis of a concatenated set of ~4100 genome-wide SNPs (topology 1 in 

). In contrast, mitochondrial cyt- 
b
gene analysis and species-tree inference of genome-wide SNPs recovered a topology in which 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
were strongly supported sister lineages, with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
being more basal (topology 2 in 

). Depths of uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence (as determined by cyt- 
b
distances) were comparatively low across all three leaf-warblers (0.7-1.6%; 

).
</p>
            <p>
In summary, our phylogenomic analyses demonstrated considerable incongruence among tree topologies, including a strong mito-nuclear discordance that calls into doubt the reliability of mitochondrial divergence values in this dataset. For instance, the deepest genomic divergence was detected between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other two species (PC1 in 

), whereas on mitochondrial cyt- 
b
evidence 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
displayed some of the most shallow divergences from the other taxa (

). The use of mitochondrial divergences in species delimitation suffers from multiple confounding biases (
79, 10 0, 10 1
), especially when dealing with complexes containing closely-allied allopatric taxa that have a propensity for secondary gene flow (
11 2-11 4
). The best explanatory hypothesis for the pronounced mito- nuclear discordance in this dataset is that occasional overwater dispersal followed by hybridization and gene flow may have led to the introgression of foreign alleles in one or the other species, obfuscating clean branching patterns. Gene flow during sporadic hybridization is known to artifactually reduce mitochondrial divergences, masking deeper levels of genomic differentiation (

79

). Hence, introgression can account for the presence of relatively low mitochondrial divergences in a group of species characterized by comparatively deep genomic divergences and pronounced levels of bioacoustic differentiation [(

Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted DNA from the fresh muscle tissue of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. suaramerdu
</tp:taxon-name>
and the three specimens collected by us (including the holotype) of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
, along with one individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. nesophilus
</tp:taxon-name>
that we had collected on Mt Tumpu on the eastern peninsula of Sulawesi (

19

). Additional tissue samples were obtained from the American Museum of Natural History, New York (AMNH): three samples of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sarasinorum
</tp:taxon-name>
from South Sulawesi and an outgroup sample of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. poliocephalus pallescens
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Solomon Islands. The AMNH samples were only used for phylogenomic rooting. DNA extraction was performed using the Exgene Clinic SV kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul) following the manufacturer’s instructions. We eluted the DNA in two consecutive rounds of 100μl molecular grade water. We prepared double-digest restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing (ddRADSeq) libraries using the same protocol as Garg et al. (
11 5
) with EcoRI and MspI as restriction enzymes. We quantified DNA and library product concentrations using the Qubit 2.0 Broad Range DNA Assay (Invitrogen, California), and used a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Iowa) to perform final quality checks on the library product. The genomic libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform at the Singapore Center for Environmental Life Science Engineering. Filtering and demultiplexing of the genomic data in STACKS 1.34 followed the same general procedures as detailed by Ng et al. (
7 2
), and are the result of comprehensive trials using a wide variety of different parameters and settings at each step of the analysis. DNA data is deposited with Genbank at BioProject accession number PRJNA566263.
</p>
            <p>
SNP calling and genomic supermatrix generation:
Reference genome alignment was performed using BWA 0.7.12 (
9 1
) and samtools 0.1.19 (http://samtools.sourceforge.net) (
9 2, 9 3
) on the Greenish Warbler (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
) genome (
11 6
), the most closely related available full genome. We performed SNP calling in STACKS 1.34 as per Ng et al. (
7 2
). We required loci to be present across all individuals, and retained one random SNP per locus to exclude obviously linked SNP loci. Subsequently, we used PLINK 1.9 (
11 7
) and Bayescan 2.1 (
11 8
) to filter SNPs for linkage disequilibrium and signs of selection. Data format manipulation and conversions were performed with PGDSpider (
1 19
). The final filtered dataset totaled 4,104 SNPs. In addition, we created concatenated SNP datasets for each group for use in downstream maximum parsimony analysis.
</p>
            <p>
Following the procedures used by Ng et al. (
7 2
), we generated a concatenated read supermatrix without missing data using pyRAD (
12 0
). We stipulated a minimum required locus coverage of 20, and kept the clustering threshold within and between reads at the default of 0.88. The final concatenated read supermatrix amounted to 2,861,661 bp in length, generated from 19,985 loci.
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial sequence generation:
We sequenced cyt- 
b
using the primers H16065 (
12 1
) and L14995 (
12 2
), with 40 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 72°C. We conducted PCR product cleanup with ExoSAP-IT 
®
and used the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) for cycle- sequencing. Sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer using capillary electrophoresis. We assembled cyt- 
b
sequences with CodonCode Aligner 4.1 and aligned them with ClustalW (
12 3
). The final cyt- 
b
alignment was 1,100bp long, indel- free and fully translatable. Mitochondrial sequences have been deposited with Genbank at accession numbers 
MN518858
- 
MN518862
.
</p>
            <p>
Population structure inference:
In order to test for the presence of geographic structuring across East Sulawesi, Peleng, and Taliabu, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the genomic SNP data. PCA was performed using ade4 (
12 4
) and factoextra (
12 5
), both available as R packages (
12 6
).
</p>
            <p>
Mitochondrial tree inference:
We constructed phylogenetic cyt- 
b
trees using two methods: maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML). We ran MP analyses using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
), performing 10,000 bootstrap replicates. For ML analyses, we first used jModelTest v2.1.6 (

97

) and determined that the Jukes-Cantor model (
12 8
) was the best performing substitution model. We then ran RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) using the extensive subtree-pruning-regrafting tree search algorithm.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic tree inference:
We applied three different genomic tree inference analyses: coalescent-based species tree inference (applied to the SNP dataset), maximum likelihood tree inference (applied to concatenated read supermatrix), and maximum parsimony tree inference (applied to the concatenated SNP dataset). We performed species tree inference using SNAPP (
1 29
) as implemented in BEAST 2.3.0, performing two iterations using default settings. Tracer 1.6 was used after each iteration to ensure that the runs had reached convergence, after which LogCombiner v2.3.0 and DensiTree (
13 0
) were used to process results. We carried out ML tree inference using RAxML v8.2.9 (

96

) on the concatenated read supermatrix using the general-time-reversible gamma-invariant (GTRGAMMA) model and performed 1,000 rapid bootstrap searches. Finally, we conducted conventional MP analysis on the concatenated SNPs of each taxon set, using the seqboot, dnapars, and consense algorithms in PHYLIP v3.695 (
12 7
) and running 10,000 bootstrap replicates to evaluate branch support.

Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts are bronzy olive (2.5Y 3/4), the remiges and rectrices slightly darker and with more coppery edging (10YR 4/6). Dull white on breast reaches to chin, with an orange-rufescent tinge (7.5YR 7/6) surrounding the breast laterally and ventrally. Yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, with a rufescent-orange suffusion to flanks (7.5YR 7/6). Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Dark-horn mandible. Yellow-orange tarsus on live bird.

One of the phenotypically most distinct subspecies of the Mountain Tailorbird or Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Uniquely among all subspecies, the new taxon has a rufescent suffusion on throat and breast, becoming especially pronounced on breast sides and auriculars (from where it grades into the rufous crown), rendering the bird’s anterior aspect much warmer-tinged than all other subspecies. The upperparts, especially upper wings, are also warmer bronzy and the flanks tinged more rufescent than all other subspecies, making this the most reddish-looking taxon in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. It additionally differs from most other subspecies (except those from Sulawesi and Peleng) in the rufous crown’s more posterior extension to the nape and in the absence of a pale supercilium.
</p>
            <p>
It further differs from

(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis

malayanus

riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow on belly and lower breast (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near- complete absence of yellow, respectively). For additional differences from the new subspecies on Peleng, see SM8.

Davidson et al. (

<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoiler (then called an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird) for Taliabu, and characterized the population as inhabiting montane forest above 500m and possibly in need of taxonomic description. FER found this population commonly in disturbed montane forest to over 1,100 m, with a few records in dense secondary bamboo thickets down to 50m (

48

), and our collecting expedition re-encountered this form abundantly at elevations around 1,300m (

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, this new subspecies is currently only known from Taliabu in the Sula Archipelago. There, it inhabits disturbed situations (forest edge, bamboo thickets) mostly in the mountains, with the highest record at 1300m, but presumably ranging to the highest point at over 1400m (

19
, 
48
, 
64

). On other islands, mountain leaftoilers rarely range lower than ~500m (

57

), but Rheindt (

48

) exceptionally recorded the new taxon on Taliabu from an extensive bamboo thicket at ~50m, demonstrating that this population may tolerate lower elevations. The presence of this leaftoiler on the other two main Sula islands, Mangole and Sanana, is likely, especially on the former, which rises to over 1,100m, but perhaps also on the latter, which reaches to a little over 600m. However, it has probably been overlooked owing to a lack of fieldwork at higher elevations on these two islands. On the Banggai Archipelago, the species is represented by another novel subspecies (see below) that replaces 
sulanus
there. Its predilection for disturbed forest situations and wide elevational tolerance as compared to other insular mountain birds probably means that it is currently not of conservation concern.

Crown and nape rich rufous (2.5YR 4/10), slightly darker posteriorly, and not extending as far onto the nape as in the new Taliabu subspecies (
P. c. sulanus
; see SM7). Short blackish eyestripe. Facial region from auriculars to lores dusky-grey (N3) with an increasing rufous suffusion (concolorous with crown) towards the malar and moustachial regions. Mantle and scapulars to uppertail coverts olive with a slight bronzy hue (5Y 3/4), colder-colored than in the new subspecies from Taliabu (
P. c. sulanus
). Remiges and rectrices are darker and duskier, but with outer edging nearly concolorous with mantle. Underparts are bicolored, with a white chin to breast, and a lemon-yellow belly and vent (5Y 8/10), brighter centrally than laterally, and with a dusky olive suffusion on the flanks. Underwing concolorous with central belly on axillaries, with increasingly white suffusion towards the remainder of the underwing. Tarsus dark-yellow. On the live bird, the upper mandible was black with a yellow tip, and the lower mandible was black with a yellow base and tip. The iris color was not clearly discerned on the live bird.

            <p>
A distinct new subspecies of Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(or ‘Mountain Tailorbird’), differing from adjacent subspecies to the east and to the west in important discrete characters.
</p>
            <p>
The lack of a supercilium and the posterior extension of the rufous crown coloration onto the mid-nape set this subspecies apart from most other subspecies, except those from Sulawesi and Taliabu, which have an equally or sometimes even slightly more extensive rufous crown. It further differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Java, Bali, Sumatra), 
cinereicollis
(Borneo), 
malayanus
(Malay Peninsula) and all subspecies further west and north in the absence of a strong grey hindcollar band and/or strongly grey breast sides; from 
<tp:taxon-name>
batjanensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(Bacan Island) in its lemon-yellow belly lacking a strong olive suffusion; and from 
dumasi
(Seram and Buru) in its much less brown-colored upperparts. In many aspects, the new taxon is similar to the set of subspecies on Sulawesi (
riedeli, stentor, meisei, hedymeles
), but dramatically differs in its much more extensive yellow belly (versus yellow on the flanks only, or a light-yellow suffusion on the lowermost underparts, or a near-complete absence of yellow, respectively).
</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies shares many unique traits with the new subspecies from Taliabu 
sulanus
(see SM7), but differs significantly in its darker chestnut crown and its less reddish overall appearance, largely lacking a rufescent suffusion to the breast and flanks, and showing much less rufescent on the auriculars; its flanks are also much colder olive-washed (versus warmly rufescent-washed), and the upperparts and especially upper wings are colder bronze-olive. On live birds, the legs are much darker and less intensely colorful than those of birds from Taliabu.

FER and Filip Verbelen first encountered and documented the new subspecies during a visit to the highlands of western Peleng between 22-31 March 2009 (

Typical of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers, this new taxon is restricted to forest edge situations, treefall gaps and bamboo thickets in montane forest on the island of Peleng in the Banggai Archipelago. During our combined visits to the island (

19
, 
49

), we recorded this new taxon from 750m to the highest point at over 1000m elevation. It may, therefore, not range as low as the new taxon from neighboring Taliabu, although future fieldwork may well produce lower elevational records. Its presence on other islands in the Banggai Archipelago is unlikely given that only one of them, the small island of Bangkulu, slightly exceeds 600m in elevation, with only 5 ha of land lying above 600m, still well below the lowest known elevational occurrence of the new subspecies. Despite its very small range, its predilection for disturbed forest situations probably means that it is not particularly negatively affected by the current degradation that is impacting most highland forests of western Peleng.

Taxonomic rationale (combined for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates cucullatus sulanus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
P. c. relictus
)


</p>
            <p>
The Mountain Leaftoiler 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
was previously thought to be an 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbird and then called Mountain Tailorbird. We here acknowledge the distant relationship to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthotomus
</tp:taxon-name>
tailorbirds (
13 1
) and therefore follow the recent trend of calling members of this species ‘leaftoilers’ rather than tailorbirds [e.g. (

57

)], a fitting translation from their re- instated scientific genus name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
. As for the species name 
<tp:taxon-name>
cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, we follow the recently proposed emendation (

6

) of the original spelling of the name (‘ 
cuculatus’
) on the basis of information in the original description showing that the name was meant to refer to the birds’ hooded appearance (from Latin cucullus – hood).
</p>
            <p>
Plumage evidence
: The new subspecies 
sulanus
from Taliabu is arguably one of the most distinctly-colored, if not the single most distinctly-colored subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(see Diagnosis) and is therefore well-deserving of subspecies status. Its reddish-suffused anterior body renders it instantly recognizable among any series of specimens. Although not as unique in morphology, we also describe 
relictus
from Peleng at the subspecific level mainly on the basis of its distinct coloration. In plumage distinctness, 
relictus
far exceeds several other previously recognized subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cucullatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, such as 
P. c. cinereicollis
.
</p>
            <p>
Bioacoustic evidence
: We have been unsuccessful in procuring a sufficiently large sample set of song recordings of the two new subspecies, precluding rigorous bioacoustic analysis. However, we note that the songs given by these two subspecies in the field did not strike us as very different from the songs of other subspecies we are familiar with. Song playback with recordings from several other islands elicited a ready response at least in 
P. c. relictus
. Based on our bioacoustic experience with Indonesian passerines, we do not have the impression that song differences of the two new subspecies would warrant anything but a subspecific treatment at the present time.
</p>
            <p>
Genomic evidence
: We created a set of ~8,500 SNPs and a genome-wide sequence alignment of over 2 million base pairs (bp), along with an alignment of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase intron 2 (ND2) sequences, to investigate levels of differentiation among 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers from Sulawesi, Peleng and Taliabu. Details on laboratory and analytical methods are given in a separate Methods paragraph below.
</p>
            <p>
Each of the three subspecies (
P. c. stentor
from eastern Sulawesi, 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng and 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu) formed a spatially separate cluster in population- genomic space (

). The main genomic division according to a PCA based on ~8,500 SNPs occurred between 
P. c. sulanus
from Taliabu versus the other two subspecies (PC1 in 

). In contrast to the leaf-warbler analysis (see SM6), this main genomic division among leaftoilers was also supported by the mitochondrial tree and the genomic ‘species tree’ (

), consistently placing 
P. c. relictus
from Peleng close to 
P. c. stentor
from Sulawesi, although the concatenated tree built from genome-wide loci was in conflict, placing 
P. c. relictus
closer to 
P. c. sulanus
. Coincidentally, the majority tree with a basal placement of 
sulanus
(topology 1 in 

) is also the arrangement that would be supported by the extraordinarily divergent plumage of 
sulanus
, making it unique among all leaftoiler subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
Pairwise divergences between the subspecies (as determined by ND2 distances) were relatively low (0.3-1.7%; 

), at levels generally accepted to be below the species threshold for birds [(~2-3%; (
100, 10 1
)], consistent with the current proposed subspecies status. These ND2 divergences further supported the majority tree (topology 1 in 

) by consistently rendering 
P. c. sulanus
as the most deeply diverged subspecies (up to ~1.7%), whereas 
P. c. relictus
and 
P. c. stentor
emerged as only 0.3% diverged.
</p>
            <p>
In summary, mitochondrial sequence analysis, PCA of genome-wide SNPs and ‘species-tree’ analysis all agree in placing 
P. c. sulanus
basal to the other two subspecies, an arrangement supported by its distinct plumage. Therefore, we have no reason to suspect bias in the mitochondrial divergence depth (unlike in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus
</tp:taxon-name>
, see SM6), which supports our bioacoustic assessment that both 
relictus
and 
sulanus
are at the subspecies level. Future studies of the uniquely colored 
P. c. sulanus
may yet challenge this assessment.
</p>
            <p>
Methodology

</p>
            <p>
Laboratory procedures:
We extracted genomic DNA of all tissue material available for 
P. c. sulanus
(n=5) and 
P. c. relictus
(n=2), along with two samples of 
P. c. stentor
that we had independently collected on Mt Tumpu on the adjacent eastern Sulawesi peninsula (

19

). Tissue of a single individual of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cettia parens
</tp:taxon-name>
from Makira in the Solomon Islands, provided by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was also extracted to serve as an outgroup in phylogenomic rooting. Laboratory and analytical protocols followed our procedures outlined in SM6 (under 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus emilsalimi
</tp:taxon-name>
), utilizing the same reference genome (
<tp:taxon-name>
Phylloscopus trochiloides viridanus
</tp:taxon-name>
), but using a minimum stack depth of 5 in STACKS 1.34 and a minimum required locus coverage of 5 in pyRAD due to differences in sequencing quality. The final filtered dataset for the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyllergates
</tp:taxon-name>
leaftoilers totaled 8,515 SNPs and the final concatenated read supermatrix was 2,002,726 bp long, generated from 13,194 separate loci. For mitochondrial analysis, we sequenced ND2 using the primers L5219Met and H6313Trp (
13 2
) with 35 cycles of PCR performed at an annealing temperature of 50-53°C, but otherwise following the procedures as outlined in SM6. The final ND2 alignment for the leaftoilers was 1,015bp long, indel-free and fully translatable. All DNA data has been deposited with Genbank at accession number PRJNA566263 and 
MN518850

Hartert, 1920 (‘extremely neglected’) from Selayar Island, were based on the impression that the description of these birds had escaped the attention of researchers for too long. The presently described taxon, only discovered in the 21

century, fulfils that criterion even more adequately, so we take pleasure in naming it 
omississimus
(‘the most neglected’), superlative of ‘omissus’.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>The immature plumage remains undocumented. The only two male specimens known to exist (holotype and MZB.Ornit.34.488) show minimal plumage variation, the only difference perhaps being the latter specimen’s slightly brighter, more brilliant rump and darker, more blackish tarsus and claws in life.</p>
            <p>As compared to males, the three female specimens have a duller blue supercilium (but still discernible), lack a black chin, have prominent rufous spectacles over a narrow blackish stripe through the cere, the rufous continuing to the lower sides of the face where it is finely speckled dark (in two of three females the speckling continues to the throat sides), and have much less dark blackish-blue auriculars, contrasting less with the rufous throat. The female’s upperparts are less brilliant blue. One of the three female specimens is slightly paler on the tarsus and claws.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
The new subspecies was first reported by Indrawan et al. (
13 3
), who documented the sighting of a female on 15 May 2001 and a male on 29 July 2001 at 50-100m elevation around Benteng on the main island of Togian, and pointed out that this new population may be an undescribed subspecies. Following their footsteps, Filip Verbelen (pers. comm.) made the first sound recordings of the new population in December 2008 when studying a few individuals on Kadidiri, a tiny forested tourist resort island off the coast of Togian measuring ~4km in length and less than 1km in width. A few days later, F. Verbelen moved to Batudaka, one of the three main islands of the archipelago, where he found additional individuals in coastal forest near the capital town of Wakai. FER visited Batudaka Island from 23-27 April 2009 and observed this new population. On our collecting trip, we visited Batudaka from 24-28 Dec 2013 and found this taxon to be common in the forests outside the capital town of Wakai, collecting the present material in the process (

19

).

Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>The new subspecies is known from the Togian Archipelago in the Gulf of Tomini, a satellite group of islands between the northern and eastern peninsulas of Sulawesi. More specifically, to the best of our knowledge the new subspecies has so far been found on the two main islands of Togian and Batudaka, as well as on the tiny islet of Kadidiri off Togian, where it is common in remnant forest and edge from near sea level to at least ~200m elevation. However, it is likely that the birds occur up to the highest elevations at ~430m on these islands. More field research is required to map this subspecies’ occurrence on other islands in this archipelago. Its presence on some of the larger, forest-covered islands in close proximity to Batudaka and Togian, such as Talatakoh, Waleakodi and Waleabahi, is virtually guaranteed, given its occurrence on tiny Kadidiri. However, its presence on slightly more distant islands, such as Puah (at ~18km from the main archipelago) and Unauna (at ~28km from the main archipelago) is less certain, although these latter islands are connected to the main archipelago by shallow sea-beds not exceeding 120m depth, indicating that they would have been connected with one another during glacial sea level recessions.</p>
            <p>
On the main island of Sulawesi, the newly described 
omississimus
is replaced by the nominate taxon 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Unusually, however, the nominate form on Sulawesi is a hill and montane forest denizen, occurring from 500-2300m elevation and shunning lowland forest habitats in stark contrast to the new subspecies.
</p>
            <p>The new subspecies appears to be moderately tolerant to habitat disturbance where small-scale timber extraction leads to a secondarization of primary forest. However, the taxon disappears where forest is converted into agricultural land. Although Togian’s forests are quickly dwindling, with most remnants by now secondary and restricted to inland locations away from the coast, far more than half of the islands should still be suitable for the new taxon, making it safe for the time being.</p>

            <p>
Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
The proposed English name of this new taxon follows a recent trend [e.g. (

57

)] to call members of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
‘jungle-flycatchers’ rather than ‘blue-flycatchers’ because molecular data (
13 4
) and bioacoustic considerations (
57, 7 4
) strongly suggest a merger of many members of the previously recognized jungle-flycatcher genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinomyias
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Given that numerous species in the resultant genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
are no longer blue but entirely brown, the name ‘blue-flycatcher’, while formerly appropriate, is no longer suitable for this genus.
</p>
            <p>
Although distinguishable from other subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
in terms of plumage characters (see Diagnosis), 
omississimus
is quite similar to them in general coloration. At any rate, plumage coloration is not an ideal taxonomic indicator in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
jungle-flycatchers, many of which boast a highly conserved male plumage sporting blue upperparts and reddish underparts. Other characters, such as bioacoustic and genetic ones, may be more conducive to guiding taxonomic decision-making in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cyornis
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
We recently published a bioacoustic comparison on the basis of six vocal parameters among members of the greater 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
radiation, showing that the song of the newly described 
omississimus
from Togian exhibits considerable vocal overlap with the songs of all three analyzed subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
, while distinctly differing from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rufigastra
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. kalaoensis
</tp:taxon-name>
[see 

in (
7 4
)]. This vocal evidence along with Togian’s proximity to Sulawesi suggest a placement of 
omississimus
as a subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Based on a lack of deep differentiation in both bioacoustic and genetic evidence, we propose to classify this new taxon at the subspecies level. Upon first discovery in the field, we were generally impressed by its lowland forest occurrence, which stands in contrast to the montane forest requirements of the nominate subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>
omissus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Sulawesi. This pronounced difference in habitat preference was given much weight in supporting species- level recognition of the new Togian population in a recently published field guide to the region (

57

). However, given Gwee et al.’s (
7 4
) newly published data, the latter treatment has ultimately proved erroneous.

in its lack of solid white or rufous on the belly; its uniform dark-brown coloration in which only the underparts show a faint warm tinge; and its unmarked dark-brown vent. The new subspecies has a darker hood and breast than the above-mentioned taxa except for the intensely rufous-bellied 
fumidus
and perhaps 
hygroscopus
. It also differs from 
deningeri
from Seram in its paler, browner (less black) body color, with a darker non-contrasting hood, and differs from 
schlegelii
and 
sterlingi
(both from Timor) in its less olive overall coloration and lack of rufous belly and vent.
</p>
            <p>
Within Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely resembles the much larger and longer-winged 
versteegi
and 
papuensis
from Papua but is dark slaty-brown (versus black) in overall body color and has an unmarked vent. The lower underparts have more extensive and paler-cinnamon feather margins in the new subspecies versus narrower, more rufous feather margins in the Papuan forms.
</p>
            <p>
Among geographically more distant Island Thrush subspecies from outside of Indonesia, the new subspecies most closely approaches three taxa from the Solomon Islands (
bougainvillei, kulambangrae, sladeni)
and two taxa from the Bismarck Archipelago (
heinrothi, beehleri
), but lacks those subspecies’ blackish overall body color. It also superficially resembles 
nigrorum
from Negros (Philippines), but the latter subspecies’ lower belly grades into whitish on the vent while the new subspecies is uniformly dark on those parts. Furthermore, another Philippine subspecies, 
kelleri
from Mt Apo (Mindanao), is similar to the new subspecies but becomes darker brown towards the front of the head while the new subspecies has a nearly uniform head coloration becoming slightly paler on the forehead.

Etymology

</p>
            <p>
The subspecies name, translated from Bahasa Indonesia “it likes the rain” (=suka hujan), refers to the circumstances surrounding the bird’s discovery. On FER’s first expedition to the highest parts of Taliabu (

48

), heavy persistent rain impeded bird observations, leading to a decision to abort the expedition ahead of schedule. On his premature descent, FER then spotted a hardy individual of the new thrush, perched in the pouring rain, leading him to change plans yet again and mount a subsequent second and eventually third expedition to these elevations in better weather. This latter third expedition then allowed for a more detailed documentation of Taliabu’s distinct novel montane avifauna (

19
, 
48

). The name 
sukahujan
is treated as an inalienable noun in apposition.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

</p>
            <p>All nine specimens procured resemble one another considerably in coloration. The greatest variation occurs in the tone of the lower breast and abdomen, which is intermediate in the holotype but ranges from all-drab brownish grey throughout with almost no warm edging (in MZB.Ornit.34.416) to more extensive cinnamon feather edging (in most adult females, especially MZB.Ornit.34.409), the latter leading to an overall warmer underparts impression. Females are variably slightly less slaty on upperparts and crown, and one adult individual (MZB.Ornit.34.416) of unknown sex has a male-like slaty tone on upperparts but a female- like crown color that is more suffused with dull brown. Two juveniles (MZB.Ornit.34.410; MZB.Ornit.34.417) exhibit noticeable mottling on their mantle and underparts coloration, caused by dark brownish-black feather margins contrasting against the paler (on underparts sometimes warm cinnamon) feather centers.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new taxon was first discovered on 8 and 9 April 2009 by FER near its type locality on the occasion of a hike to the highest elevations on Taliabu that was cut short by heavy rainfall. Subsequent sightings on 14 and 15 April 2009 were made in the same area on the occasion of a return visit (

48

). We found this population again during our collecting trip to this area from 6-16 Dec 2013 (

19

) and collected the type along with the accompanying specimens.

<tp:taxon-name>

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
With approximately 50 subspecies, the Island Thrush 
<tp:taxon-name>
Turdus poliocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
is arguably the most polytypic bird species on Earth (
13 5
). Attempts to separate this variable species complex into smaller species-level lineages [e.g. (
13 6
)] have been called into question by genetic data showing that plumage characters are not a good predictor of close relationships in this complex (
13 7
). Hence, modern sources generally continue to unite all or most subspecies into one polytypic species. Not unlike some Philippine subspecies previously under study (
13 7
), the new subspecies from Taliabu is phenotypically extremely different from neighboring forms but more closely resembles certain geographically distant subspecies. It is presently best accommodated at the subspecies level. Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic inquiries are needed in the future to assess whether any internal species limits must be drawn within the complex. Such future analyses may well elevate the Taliabu Island Thrush to species level. However, such analyses are currently hampered by a lack of crucial comparative DNA material.

Description of holotype

</p>
            <p>Forehead to crown and nape dark slaty blue (2.5PB 2/2) with slightly scaly appearance generated through narrow black feather centres; the same color, but without the scaly appearance, then continues through mantle and scapulars to rump. A white supercilium starts above the centre of the eye and ends just shy of the bill base, becoming narrower towards the front. A black facial patch centred in the loral region and below the supercilium to the chin (with narrow rows of black feathers above the bill base) grades into dark slaty blue coloration (2.5PB 1.5/2) towards the auriculars and the malar and moustachial regions, merging with the nape and mantle. Upperwing coverts largely concolorous with crown, with vestiges of an extremely indistinct brighter carpal patch visible with difficulty on this specimen. Remiges are dark slaty brown (10YR 2.5/1), the larger primaries with warmer, paler outer edging (10YR 4/2). Breast intensely rufous (7.5YR 7/12), becoming slightly paler on throat and upper flanks, and becoming pale cinnamon-whitish on belly and lower flanks (7.5YR 9/4), and eventually off-white on undertail coverts. Tail dull black on upper side, blackish-grey (N2) on underside, with indistinct white base to outermost rectrices. Iris dark-brown; legs light-pink; black bill with pinkish gape flange on live bird.</p>

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
An unequivocal member of the Snowy-browed Flycatcher 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ficedula hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
, and one of its most easterly outposts, with minor plumage distinctions in the male and major plumage distinctions in the female, a combination of which conclusively demarcates this new taxon from other subspecies.
</p>
            <p>
The male subtly differs from adjacent insular subspecies to the south and to the west, namely from the two Sulawesi subspecies (
jugosae, annalisa
), from 
sumatrana
(Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo), from 
vulcani
(Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores), and from 
alifura
(Buru), in the reduction of white patches at the base of the outer tail feathers, and in the slightly less extensive rufous underparts, replaced on the belly by pale cinnamon- whitish. In contrast, males of the only subspecies to the east and north (
pallidipectus
from Bacan Island) are markedly paler on the underparts than the males of this new subspecies, and have more contrastingly olive flanks. The white supercilium in males of the new subspecies is narrower than that of at least 
sumatrana, vulcani
, and 
alifura
.
</p>
            <p>
The female is highly distinct from most subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. hyperythra
</tp:taxon-name>
in her bluish (versus olive, brown or grey-brown) upperparts coloration, extensive cold-brown mottling on breast (versus little to none), and a washed-out face pattern ghosting that of the male, with a whiter (versus rufous) brow. The only other subspecies that equals female 
F. h. betinabiru
in her bluish tinge to the upperparts is 
alifura
from adjacent Buru, in which the back color is ever so slightly brighter-blue. Compared to the new subspecies, the female of 
alifura
exhibits a more rufous (less white) eye brow, and brighter and more extensive rufous underparts with less brown mottling.

Individual, sex and age-related variation within the taxon

            <p>
Only adult specimens have been procured, although a photo of a 
pullus
near the nest suggests an early juvenile plumage similar to other subspecies. Among adults, tarsus color as recorded in the field on live birds appears to vary individually from light-pink to pinkish-horn.
</p>
            <p>There is minor variation among the nine adult male specimens procured in the lower extent of the rufous breast, the intensity of the cinnamon wash to the belly, thickness of the supercilium and the extent of vestigial white patches on the basal outer rectrices. There is minor variation among the five adult female specimens in the intensity of brown mottling on the underparts, width and paleness of the supercilium and the presence or absence of a slight brownish tinge to the lowermost mantle portion.</p>
            <p>
History of discovery

</p>
            <p>
This new subspecies of Snowy-browed Flycatcher was first encountered by the University of East Anglia expedition to Taliabu in 1991 (
64, 9 8
). Members of that survey found the new taxon predominantly at the highest altitude they reached (roughly 800m) and suggested that it may be a novel subspecies. FER then saw one adult male at 1100m during his visit to the highlands of western Taliabu on 5 April 2009 (

48

). We returned to this general area between 6-16 December 2013, where we found 
betinabiru
as one of the most common constituents of the forest interior understorey avifauna and collected the type and accompanying individuals at ~1300m (

19

).

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>
Distribution and status

</p>
            <p>
Subspecies 
betinabiru
is currently only known from the understorey of dense montane forest in the highlands of Taliabu at above 800m elevation (
19, 48, 64, 9 8
). Extensive logging has occurred across the highlands of Taliabu, with some parts of the mountains additionally affected by large-scale forest fires (see Taliabu Grasshopper-Warbler account in SM3; 

). As an understory inhabitant, 
betinabiru
would be particularly susceptible to this kind of habitat degradation and is therefore probably declining. Nevertheless, it remains extremely common where good habitat persists, as indicated by our high mistnet capture rates (

19

).
</p>
            <p>
To the best of our knowledge, Snowy-browed Flycatchers have not been detected on the two other main islands of the Sula Archipelago, although their occurrence is possible at least on Mangole, which rises to 1,127m, while very unlikely on Sanana, which does not rise taller than ~600m. If confirmed on Mangole, it is likely that the local population would refer to the same subspecies 
betinabiru
.
</p>
            <p>
On the adjacent Banggai Archipelago, a single Snowy-browed Flycatcher was recorded once in April 2009 at 800-900m on the tallest island of Peleng (

49

). To the best of our knowledge, there have not been subsequent records from this island despite extensive fieldwork. In the absence of photos or closer details about the single Peleng record, it is impossible to ascertain whether the Peleng population is ascribable to 
betinabiru
, to one of the two Sulawesi races (
annalisa, jugosae
) or to a novel unnamed subspecies.

Taxonomic rationale

</p>
            <p>
We describe this new taxon on the basis of its characteristic plumage (especially in females). These plumage distinctions certainly warrant a description at the subspecific level as they exceed those of several more poorly marked subspecies within this complex (e.g. 
annalisa
[Stresemann, 1931], which only subtly differs from 
jugosae
[Riley, 1921]). Bioacoustic variation in this species complex is poorly explored, but the high-pitched courtship vocalization of the new subspecies superficially resembles that of many other subspecies, and playback of songs from other subspecies elicits a ready response from members of this population. Genetic differences between the new taxon and other subspecies remain unexplored.
