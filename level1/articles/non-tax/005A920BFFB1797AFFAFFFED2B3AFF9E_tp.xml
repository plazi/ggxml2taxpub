         <title> Abstract </title>
         <p> Samples for isolation of dictyostelid cellular slime molds were obtained from 20
            collecting sites at 18 localities in south central and southeastern Madagascar during
            May 2009 . At least thirty species of dictyostelids representing seven genera were
            recovered from 52 samples of soil/humus. This total included 17 species described as new
            to science, 13 species already known from various localities throughout the world, and
            four isolates that remain unidentified. Fourteen of the new species isolated from these
            samples are members of the whorl-branched, light-spored genus <tp:taxon-name>
               Heterostelium </tp:taxon-name> (formerly <tp:taxon-name> Polysphondylium
            </tp:taxon-name> ). The overall level of species richness of dictyostelids in Madagascar
            is greater than what is known for all of mainland Africa sampled to date. Levels of
            biodiversity in Madagascar were higher for mesic than for xeric vegetation types , and
            each of the newly described species of <tp:taxon-name> Heterostelium </tp:taxon-name>
            appeared to have a limited distribution among the localities sampled . </p>

         <title> Introduction </title>
         <p> The dictyostelids (Phylum Amoebozoa), also known as cellular slime molds or social
            amoebae, are a group of eukaryotic microorganisms commonly found in soils worldwide,
            where they are ecologically important as predators of soil bacteria ( ). Dictyostelids
            are particularly well known for eastern North America, western Europe, and portions of
            China ( ), where they have widely studied for several decades. Much of the remainder of
            the world is understudied. This is particularly true for most areas of the Southern
            Hemisphere, where the most noteworthy studies appear to be those carried out in New
            Zealand by , Australia by , southern South America by , and South Africa by . The first
            publication on the dictyostelids of Madagascar was by but was limited to the description
            of several new species with little ecological data. </p>
         <p> Madagascar is the world’s fourth largest oceanic island and has a total area of 59,280
            km 2 . Long part of the supercontinent of Gondwana, it separated along with Africa and
            India from the rest of Gondwana (South America, Australia , India , and Antarctica )
            about 150 to 160 million years ago and then split off from India during the period of 84
            to 91 million years ago ( ). Madagascar has remained geologically isolated since then (
            , ). The island has an elliptical shape and much of it consists of a large central
            plateau that ranges in elevation from 800–1,800 m and has a cover of vegetation that
            consists largely of savannah-steppe. There are some highlands in the northern part of
            the island, and a lowland belt that is now mostly cultivated surrounds the interior
            plateau. Major eco-regions found in Madagascar include tropical broadleaf forest
            remnants on the eastern coast and east-facing slopes of the plateau, subhumid forests in
            the highlands above 2,000 m and gallery forests in ravines on the plateau, a transition
            to ericoid thickets in the south, abundant mature grasslands and shrublands, spiny
            thickets in the far south, dry deciduous forests in the southwest and some areas of
            semi-desert ( , Figs. 1–12 ). The true tropical rainforest remnants along the east coast
            have an annual monsoonal rainfall of up to 4,000 mm , but the remainder of the country
            is much drier. The driest and coolest season of the portion of Madagascar considered in
            the present study extends from May to October, with the period between September and
            October especially dry. The wettest and warmest season occurs during the period of
            November to April, with an annual rainfall of 1,400 mm at the capital of Antananarivo (
            ). </p>
         <p> Madagascar has numerous endemic plants and animals, and a recent update to the endemic
            flora reported that 84% of indigenous angiosperms are endemic to the island,
            underscoring the critical role of the island in retaining this genetic repository of the
            world’s flora ( ). Land degradation is a major problem on the island despite many
            initiatives to protect the unique key ecosystems present. These include establishing,
            augmenting, and managing protected areas ( ) as well as finding methods to enrich and
            replant native tree species ( ). </p>
         <p> The primary objectives of the study reported in this paper were to describe the
            distribution and ecology of dictyostelids on Madagascar , an island characterized by one
            of the most unique biotas of the world, and to compare and contrast the assemblage of
            species present (especially members of the genus <tp:taxon-name> Heterostelium
            </tp:taxon-name> ) with those reported from other regions of the world. </p>

         <p> Fifty-four samples of soil/humus were obtained from Madagascar during a three-week
            period in May 2009 , which coincided with the end of the rainy season. These 54 samples
            came from 20 collecting sites in 18 separate localities ( Fig. 13 ) representing 12
            different types of natural vegetation that included examples characterized by mesic or
            xeric moisture regimes ( Table 1 ). All samples were sent to two different coauthor
            laboratories for processing, with each laboratory receiving 27 replicate samples (half
            of the total 54). Isolation procedures for dictyostelids followed , with additional
            information relating to the culture techniques used described in . Later, all isolates
            were further reviewed by additional coauthors for morphological characterization. </p>
         <p> Although 54 samples were collected and sent to the two laboratories, two of these
            samples were excluded from processing because they were very dry and consisted mostly of
            pebbles. Although 18 different localities were sampled, two of these (MGR-09-14 and
            MGR-09-29) encompassed examples of both a xeric site and a mesic site. As such, there
            were a total of 20 collecting sites in the 18 localities. The assemblage of species of
            dictyostelids now known from Madagascar was compared with those reported for mainland
            Africa, Australia , China , Costa Rica , Mexico , Tikal (in Guatemala ), and the United
            States ( , , Cavender et al. 2010, , ), where comparable sets of data are available
            (Table 3). For the purpose of this comparison, only isolates reliably referred to a
            particular species were considered, and all sub-specific identifications (e.g.,
            varieties and subspecies) were excluded. For each region, data are provided for the
            total number of species, the number of species shared in common with Madagascar , the
            coefficient of community index for the pairwise combination of Madagascar and the region
            in question, and the percentage of the total number of species represented by members of
            the genus <tp:taxon-name> Heterostelium </tp:taxon-name> . The coefficient of community
            index used herein was CC = 2c/(a = b), where a = the total number of species in the
            first set of data being compared, b = the number of species in the second set of data
            being compared, and c = the number of species shared in common between the two sets of
            data ( ). Coefficient of community values range from 0 to 1.0, where 0 indicates no
            common species shared between two study areas or datasets and 1 indicates that all
            species are common to both study areas or sets of data. </p>

         <title> Results </title>
         <p> The 52 samples of soil/humus processed for dictyostelids yielded 34 species in seven
            genera. This total included 17 species described as new to science, 13 species already
            known from various localities throughout the world, and four isolates that remain
            unidentified to the level of species. Fourteen of the new species are members of the
            whorlbranched, light-spored genus <tp:taxon-name> Heterostelium </tp:taxon-name>
            (formerly <tp:taxon-name> Polysphondylium </tp:taxon-name> ) ( ). The 52 samples also
            yielded two new species in the genus <tp:taxon-name> Cavenderia </tp:taxon-name> and one
            in the genus <tp:taxon-name> Raperostelium </tp:taxon-name> . There is one additional
            new species ( <tp:taxon-name> H. migatissimum </tp:taxon-name> ) now known for
            Madagascar that was isolated from samples collected from a karst cave in the northern
            portion of the island in a separate study. This species is not included in Table 2
            because it was considered outside the scope of the research being reported in the
            present paper.. </p>
         <p> The 52 samples were not equally productive for dictyostelids. No isolates were
            recovered from sixteen of the samples processed, but dictyostelids were recorded from 17
            of the 18 localities. In only two instances did the number of clones recorded for a
            single collecting site exceed 100, and in only two others did the number of clones
            exceed 50. A total of 401 clones were recovered from the positive samples, for an
            average of 193 clones/gram for all samples ( Fig. 14 ). For dictyostelids, a clone is
            considered to be derived from a single propagule (spore or microcyst) and thus
            represents as much of an “individual” as possible to recognize for this group of
            microorganisms. </p>
         <p> Altogether there were 12 xeric forest, shrub, and grassland collecting sites in eleven
            different localities. Samples from three of these localities did not yield any clones of
            dictyostelids at the time sampling was carried out. Three collecting sites in the same
            number of localities considered as mesic yielded only a single clone. The seven mesic
            localities included subhumid tropical, primary montane tropical and gallery forests
            bordering streams, and higher elevation grasslands. All samples except two obtained from
            subhumid tropical forest collecting sites had dictyostelids. These data suggest that
            populations of dictyostelids at a particular collecting site tend to reflect
            environmental conditions, with both overall abundance and species richness higher for
            vegetation types associated with mesic collecting sites as opposed to those associated
            with xeric collecting sites ( Fig. 14 ). </p>
         <p> Xeric sites had more clones of the larger species of dictyostelids (e.g.,
               <tp:taxon-name>Dictyostelium purpureum</tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>D.
               giganteum</tp:taxon-name> , and <tp:taxon-name> Polysphondylium violaceum
            </tp:taxon-name> ) as well as the new species of <tp:taxon-name> Heterostelium
            </tp:taxon-name> . In contrast, mesic sites had more of the smaller species of
            dictyostelids (e.g., <tp:taxon-name>Cavenderia deminutivum</tp:taxon-name> ,
               <tp:taxon-name>Hagiwaraea lavandulum</tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>D.
               implicatum</tp:taxon-name> , and <tp:taxon-name> Coremiostelium polycephalum
            </tp:taxon-name> ) as well as the two newly described yellow-pigmented species
               <tp:taxon-name> Cavenderia canoesporum </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> C .
               basinodulosum ( Perrigo et al. 2020 ) </tp:taxon-name> . The predominantly grassy
            habitats yielded just two species ( <tp:taxon-name> Dictyostelium giganteum
            </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> D. leptosomum </tp:taxon-name> ). </p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name> Dictyostelium purpureum </tp:taxon-name> was the most widespread species
            and was recorded at seven collecting sites and in six different types of habitats.
               <tp:taxon-name> Dictyostelium giganteum </tp:taxon-name> was the only other species
            recorded from at least five collecting sites ( Fig. 15 ). The 14 new species of
               <tp:taxon-name> Heterostelium </tp:taxon-name> were found at 10 collecting sites and
            in seven different habitats, with nine from mesic collecting sites and six from xeric
            collecting sites. A single species was recorded from both mesic and xeric collecting
            sites. </p>

         <title> Discussion </title>
         <p> The results obtained in the present study appear to provide additional information
            relating to the importance of environmental factors on the distribution of dictyostelids
            in nature. In Costa Rica ( ), the only samples which did not yield dictyostelids were
            either from high elevations or very xeric sites. In Mexico (Cavender et al. 2010), only
            samples collected from several desert sites did not produce dictyostelids. In Madagascar
            , with a much smaller number of samples, dictyostelid density in the processed samples
            was 193 clones/gram and 3.9 clones/isolation culture plate. This compares with 165
            clones/gram for Costa Rica and 229/gram for Mexico .As already indicated, there were 30
            described species plus four unidentified species isolated in the present study. This is
            a relatively high number, since there were 26 described species for all of Costa Rica
            and 28 for Mexico , which were sampled more extensively. The xeric and mesic sites in
            Madagascar had equal levels of species richness, with 17 and 18 species, respectively. </p>
         <p> Despite the dry environmental conditions that prevail throughout most of Madagascar ,
            species richness of dictyostelids was greater than all areas of the African mainland
            sampled to date. For example, there were 13 described species from tropical forests of
            the Central African Republic ( ), 10 from both Kenya and South Africa (Cavender et al.
            2010), and a total of 25 for all of mainland Africa. In this initial sampling of
            Madagascar , there were 13 described species along with17 new, previously undescribed
            species. </p>
         <p> Some of the species in the assemblage present in Madagascar appear are similar to those
            reported for the assemblages known from tropical forests in Mexico and Tikal, Guatemala
            . For example, <tp:taxon-name> Cavenderia deminutivum </tp:taxon-name> was first
            isolated from a seasonal rain forest near Veracruz , Mexico ( ) and has been reported
            several times since then, but only in Central America. This species occurred quite
            abundantly in the Ranomafana subhumid forest in Madagascar but has not yet been reported
            from elsewhere in Africa, although this does not preclude it being present. Also
            recorded were two species of yellow-pigmented dictyostelids reminiscent of the
            yellow-pigmented species <tp:taxon-name> C. granulophorum </tp:taxon-name> and
               <tp:taxon-name> C. medusoides </tp:taxon-name> from Tikal, Guatemala ( ).Another
            similarity with Central America was the presence in Madagascar of a species very similar
            to <tp:taxon-name> Heterostelium colligatum </tp:taxon-name> , a species first described
            from Tikal ( ). </p>
         <p> Madagascar is characterized by one of the highest number of species (14) of
               <tp:taxon-name> Heterostelium </tp:taxon-name> of any region of the world sampled to
            date. This could well represent an example of radiation after several colonization
            events by one or two species. As Madagascar separated and drifted northward into a
            region of the world characterized by a more tropical climate, new environments related
            to different types of vegetation were created that were subsequently colonized by
               <tp:taxon-name> Heterostelium </tp:taxon-name> and the genus might have been selected
            for new morphologies under the new conditions. However, it should be noted that over
            recent geological time, the climate of Madagascar ( ), like the rest of the world, has
            undergone change. For example, Li et al. (2000) indicated that there is evidence to
            suggest that Madagascar has been subjected to catastrophic ecological and landscape
            transformation due to such factors as human activities and island-wide drought during
            the past 8,000 years. It is not known what impact this might have had on dictyostelids. </p>
         <p> Interestingly, some similarities also have been noted for the myxomycetes, another
            entirely different group of eumycetozoans, from Madagascar and arid areas of Mexico ( ).
            It is possible that longdistance dispersal may have been a factor, since a recent study
            ( ) reported the occurrence in the Namib Desert of southern Africa of several species of
            myxomycetes previously known only from the New World. However, long-distance dispersal
            does not appear to be a factor for dictyostelids since their spores do not ordinarily
            become airborne ( ). </p>
         <p> As indicated by the figures provided in Table 3, total numbers of species of
            dictyostelids reported to date ranged from 22 ( Australia ) to 46 ( United States ) and
            China (54). It seems likely that the highest numbers are related to differences in the
            sizes of the regions surveyed. For example, China is sixteen times the size of
            Madagascar . However, the total for Madagascar is higher than those of five other
            regions despite the fact that most of the data for the island were obtained from a
            single collecting trip. The number of species shared in common with Madagascar ranged
            from six to 11 with one noteworthy exception—Tikal. These totals are reflected in the
            coefficient of community values, which were fairly consistent (range 0.21 to 0.29),
            except for Tikal, which had a much lower value (0.07). Clearly, the assemblages of
            dictyostelids for Madagascar and Tikal vary rather considerably at the level of species. </p>
         <p> The large number of species of <tp:taxon-name> Heterostelium </tp:taxon-name> recorded
            from Madagascar was noted earlier in this paper. Representatives of this genus made up
            almost half (48%) of all species recorded. Australia had the next highest total (32%).
            This could be linked to the fact that both Madagascar and Australia are isolated land
            masses characterized by a predominantly xeric climate. However, Tikal, with the next
            highest percentage of species of <tp:taxon-name> Heterostelium </tp:taxon-name> , has a
            mesic and not a xeric climate. </p>
         <p> Although the present study was limited in extent, examining the data from just 52
            samples from 20 different collecting sites in the central and southern part of the
            island, the results indicate that Madagascar has a species rich and distinct assemblage
            of dictyostelids, a pattern that is likewise observed in many other larger taxa such as
            plants and animals. Mainland Africa as a whole, based on the sampling carried out to
            date, appears to have one of the least biodiverse assemblages of dictyostelids of any
            continent, with the subcontinent of India also appearing to be characterized by a low
            level of biodiversity ( ). In contrast, Madagascar may have one of the most species rich
            assemblages of any region of comparable size anywhere in the world, based on the data
            currently available. There are some interesting correspondences between the
            dictyostelids of Central America and Madagascar that have not shown up in comparison
            with the rest of Africa. It is not immediately apparent why this occurs, even
            considering the breakup of Gondwana. However, the range of habitats available (at least
            those from which samples have been collected) may represent a factor. Of particular
            interest is the apparent speciation in the genus <tp:taxon-name> Heterostelium
            </tp:taxon-name> , which was found to occur prolifically in Madagascar . </p>
