         <p> Introduction </p>
         <p> Biodiversity loss has settled to one of the major environmental problems of the twenty
            first century, consequently countries worldwide have proceeded to establish protected
            areas in order to halt the loss and preserve species and habitats of high conservation
            value. In the European Union, the Natura 2000 network is the largest network for nature
            conservation extending to all member states. However despite the effort so far, the
            biodiversity crisis in Europe continues to deepen ( ). Human activities, like habitat
            destruction and pollution, are considered a compelling driver of biodiversity loss ( ).
            In particular, one of the major human activities affecting biodiversity in protected
            areas is transportation ( ; ). </p>
         <p> Roads have been reported to have both positive and negative effects on society, whilst
            reports on the negative impacts on ecological impacts have been widespread. Roads
            function as ecological corridors for dispersal for many species, but this implies the
            inclusion of alien and invasive species ( ). On the other hand, roadsides in intensive
            agricultural landscapes have a positive effect by maintaining native grassland plants
            and nesting sites for wildlife ( ). In urban landscapes roads function as a major driver
            for socio-economic changes ( ). Less recognized is the ecological protection resulting
            from 'bundling traffic' i.e. the concentration of traffic on main roads permitting the
            surrounding environment to be undisturbed. Nevertheless, recent studies indicate that
            the design of new road systems should take into account the bundling of roads instead of
            the uniform distribution across the landscape ( ). </p>
         <p> Among the negative road impacts are situations of altered animal behaviour due to roads
            (reviewed in ), landscape impermeability to small ( ; ) and larger mammals ( ; ; ; ) and
            increased amphibian mortality ( ; , ). Physical and chemical conditions in areas
            subjected to road construction are altered ( ) as are the hydrologic and geomorphologic
            attributes of a site ( ). Moreover, vehicle collisions and increased human access to
            natural areas and reserves contribute to the decline of many species' populations ( ; ;
            ). </p>
         <p> The majority of studies on biodiversity loss due to road networks emphasize the effects
            on species movement (e.g. ; ), increased mortality ( ; ; ), habitat fragmentation and
            edge effects ( ; ; ; ' ; ; ; ; ), invasion by exotic species ( ), or increased human
            access to wildlife habitats ( ), all of which are expected to increase local extinction
            rates or decrease local recolonization rates. </p>
         <p> Compared to other land use alterations, roads may be the leading mechanism of
            fragmentation and habitat reduction in protected areas ( ; ). In addition, many studies
            have emphasized the effects of roads on fragmenting wildlife populations ( ; ). </p>
         <p> Over the past two decades an increased interest in the importance of roadless areas in
            biological conservation has been observed ( ; ). Although there has been a recent
            attempt in Europe to address roadless and low-traffic areas as conservation targets ( ),
            most of research on the topic originates in the US and Australia (e.g. ; ; ; ). In the
            US roadless areas play an important role in the conservation of biodiversity due to
            their size and location, but also to the adoption of the Roadless Rule environmental
            impact statement of the Forest Service ( ). In Australia, on the other hand, nature
            conservation authorities have developed techniques for wilderness identification and
            analysis to assess the impact of roadless areas in management strategies ( ). In other
            parts of the word with longer history of human activity, as in Greece, roads mostly
            follow the tracks of ancient pathways, and several roads are known to have been in
            operation since ancient times ( ). For the assessment of the road system in the Natura
            2000 network, in this study, roadless areas denote protected sites not intersected by
            roads. </p>
         <p> There is pressing need for protected areas' management to take into account road
            networks, since the ecological influences of roads may extend hundreds-or thousands-of
            meters from the roadside, suggesting a direct ecological road effect on most protected
            areas ( ). The increase of protected areas in Europe following the implementation of the
            EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and in particular the Natura 2000 network ( ) saw an
            increase of roaded protected areas, which however has not been ensued by a corresponding
            increase of research regarding road effects on biodiversity ( ; ). Therefore, it is of
            utmost importance that the European Union includes roadless areas in its conservation
            policies ( ). The Mediterranean basin is one of the world's biodiversity 'hotspots'
            containing a great variety of plant and animal taxa ( ; ). In Greece, a country rich in
            biodiversity, the most important and actively managed protected areas prior to the
            designation of Natura 2000 network were National Parks, found mainly in mountainous
            areas with limited road network and human presence. However, with the implementation of
            Natura 2000 network many sites now include roads or are located in close proximity to
            intensively farmed land and coastal areas with tourist development ( ). As a result, the
            majority of Natura 2000 sites in the country are inhabited and dissected by roads of
            variable traffic load. </p>
         <p> Our goal was the interpretation of road effects on the ecology of protected areas in
            Greece, thus we focused on the effects of road density on habitat richness in Natura
            2000 network. Since the study covers the entire country we considered a landscape level
            approach ( ; ), which reflects landscape pattern analysis in relation to habitat
            suitability and ecological assessment ( ). The main objectives of this study were: a) to
            investigate which landscape characteristics (e.g. ecosystem type, altitude) influence
            road density in the protected sites and b) to examine if habitat richness within the
            Natura 2000 network is affected by road density. </p>

         <p>Methods</p>
         <p>Study area</p>
         <p> Greece occupies an area of 131,990 km2 and has a population of approximately 11
            million. Nearly one third of the land comprises lowland plains, valleys and foothill
            country that is generally fertile and productive. The remaining two-thirds are mostly
            mountainous terrain. Variation of climatic conditions and geomorphologic characteristics
            as well as its geographic position create an impressive variety of vegetation types and
            habitats. In these habitats breed a diversity of terrestrial species (60% of which nest
            in Greece), reptiles, amphibians and freshwater fish ( ). Greece has also a rich flora,
            according to Dimopoulos et al. (pers. comm. 2012: Checklist of the Vascular Plants of
            Greece, currently in progress) which consists of c. 7000 vascular taxa (indigenous and
            naturalized aliens), while according to , ), , the estimated number of native plant taxa
            is 6437 or c. 5800 species. The plant diversity of Greece rates among the highest in
            Europe and the Mediterranean and includes 913 endemic species ( ). </p>
         <p> Greece, as a member state of the European Union, designated a national network of
            protected areas to be included in the European Natura 2000 network and by 2011 a total
            of 419 sites was included in the Greek Natura 2000 database. The study area includes the
            entire Natura 2000 network in Greece, after taking into account the overlaps of sites
            designated under the Birds (SPAs) and those under the Habitats (SCIs) Directives, which
            includes 371 sites and covers more than 22% (29,249 km2) of the national terrestrial
            area. These sites cover most geological formations present in Greece ( ) and range in
            elevation from 0 to 2,917 m. </p>
         <p>Datasets</p>
         <p> We studied 214 terrestrial sites included in the Greek Natura 2000 network, for which
            digital habitat maps were available (60.45% of Natura 2000 terrestrial sites). For these
            sites the total terrestrial area was calculated after omitting any aquatic (marine or
            freshwater) areas. A map of the road system (1:500,000 scale) was overlaid on the Natura
            2000 network and GIS analyses were performed using ArcGIS software ( ). The road map
            included all tarmac roads (high quality carriageways, dual carriageways, regional and
            local roads). Information on forest roads was not available and therefore not included
            in the analysis. We calculated road density for all sites and had access to similar data
            for the country as a whole. Based on the Natura 2000 database, we derived information
            regarding the number of habitat types in the 214 selected sites. In total, 101 different
            habitat types were recognised. The habitat type richness in our case corresponds to
            habitats listed on Annex I of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) which identifies
            habitat types as aspects of biodiversity for which SCI have to be proposed to be
            monitored ( ; ; ). It is acknowledged that the habitat type affects ecosystem function,
            and thus it could be considered as an indicator of biodiversity ( ). Finally, a
            topographic map of Greece (scale 1: 100000) was also used in order to assess the
            altitudinal distribution of Natura 2000 sites in relation to road density. </p>
         <p>Data analysis</p>
         <p>The 214 sites of the Natura 2000 network were characterised as either coastal, forest or
            freshwater based on the dominant land use and habitat types according to the EU Habitats
            Directive (92/43/EEC). This information was derived from the Natura 2000 and CORINE Land
            Cover databases.</p>
         <p> We also employed Vector-based Landscape Analysis Tools (version 1.1, ) to calculate
            three major fragmentation indices namely landscape division, splitting index, effective
            mesh size as well as the number of patches due to roads for each Natura 2000 site.
            Landscape division, splitting index and effective mesh size are three quantitative
            measures that characterize landscape fragmentation in a geometric perspective ( ).
            Explanatory information regarding fragmentation metrics is shown in Appendix. </p>
         <p>To investigate for any potential relationship between road density across Natura 2000
            sites and fragmentation metrics we used non parametric Spearman correlation coefficient;
            the analysis was repeated by grouping sites within each ecosystem type (i.e. coastal,
            forest, freshwater). We further used Kruskal-Wallis test to investigate the potential
            differences between the fragmentation metrics in the three ecosystem types. The
            relationship between road density and the surface of the sites was assessed by means of
            linear regression.</p>
         <p>Mixed-model regression was applied to analyse the relationship between the road density
            (dependent variable), habitat richness and altitude (covariates) and their interactions.
            Ecosystem category was entered as a random factor.</p>
         <p>Variables were transformed (log or square root) as necessary to meet assumptions of
            normality and homoscedasticity of residuals.</p>
         <p>A linear regression was applied to provide a more thorough investigation of the
            relationship between road density and habitat richness.</p>
         <p> All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 18.0 ( ). </p>

         <p>Results</p>
         <p> The total length of roads in the Natura 2000 network is 8,625 km while the total
            surface of Natura 2000 sites intersected by roads is 23,199 km2. Average road density
            for the whole 214 sites was 0.37 km/km2 ( Fig. 1 ). 32 sites were found to be roadless,
            17 of which are coastal, 9 are forest and 6 are freshwater ecosystems. The total area of
            roadless sites ranged from 1.29 to 109.33 km2 (mean: 26.87 +/- 29.01 km2), which was
            significantly smaller compared to the remaining 182 roaded sites of the network (mean:
            127.46 +/- 151.87 km2) (P&lt;0.01). The mean altitude of roadless areas was 257.51 m (
            +/- 464.67 m) while the mean altitude of roaded sites was 566.26 m ( +/- 522.90). </p>
         <p> Road density in these sites ranged from 0.0004 km/km2 to 2.46 km/km2. The mean road
            density of the protected areas was significantly lower than the national road density
            (0.44 km/km2) (all sites: P&lt;0.01; roaded sites: P&lt;0.01). The distribution of road
            density values in studied sites (n=214) was right skewed; half the areas had low road
            densities (less than 0.3 km/km2) and only three had road densities greater than 1.50
            km/km2 ( Fig. 2 ). Most roaded sites (97%) were intersected by regional roads and/or
            local roads (76%) and less than half of the protected areas (46%) were crossed by dual
            carriageways. Roaded sites within the Natura 2000 network demonstrated a significant
            lower mean density of local (mean= 0.23 +/- 0.32 km/km2) and regional (mean= 0.09 +/-
            0.14 km/km2) roads compared to the country as a whole (in both cases P&lt;0.01). Road
            density of forested and coastal sites was significantly lower than the national average
            road density (P&lt;0.01). In contrast, we found no significant difference between road
            density in freshwater aquatic sites and national road density (P=0.46). </p>
         <p> We found no significant correlation between a site's surface area and road density (P =
            0.09). </p>
         <p>Our analysis revealed positive and significant correlations between road density and
            landscape division (rs= 0.59, P&lt;0.01), splitting index (rs= 0.58, P&lt;0.01) and
            number of patches (rs= 0.46, P&lt;0.01). Similar results were obtained when repeating
            the analysis by grouping protected sites as coastal, forest and freshwater ecosystems.
            In contrast, road density was negatively correlated with effective mesh size (rs= -0.17,
            P&lt;0.05); which however, was not significantly associated with road density when
            grouping our data into the three ecosystem types.</p>
         <p> Effective mesh size was significantly different among the three ecosystem types
            (Kruskal-Wallis test H=11.29, P&lt;0.01) with higher values supported at the forested
            sites. No other significant difference was indicated for the fragmentation metrics among
            the studied ecosystems types (in all cases P&gt;0.05) ( Table 1 ). </p>
         <p> When the mixed-model regression was implemented road density was not related to either
            habitat richness (P=0.29), mean site altitude (P=0.32) or their interaction (P=0.73).
            Road density was found to be related to ecosystem type (P&lt;0.05) with a higher value
            observed at freshwater ecosystems (mean=0.49 km/km2) than in coastal (mean=0.36 km/km2)
            and forests (mean=0.29 km/km2). </p>
         <p> In Figure 3 the relationship between habitat richness and road density is illustrated.
            Sites with low road density values could support either low or high habitat diversity .
            But as road density increases the variance in habitat richness values among sites
            decreases. At high road density values, medium habitat richness was observed. Finally,
            we did not identify any significant correlation between road density and habitat
            diversity within any of the three ecosystem types. </p>

         <title>N/A</title>
         <p>Discussion</p>
         <p> Although Europe is considered to be the most highly fragmented continent ( ), the
            majority of ecological research on the effects of roads and the importance of roadless
            areas for conservation biology comes mainly from the US. Greece shows an overall low
            average road density (0.44 km/km2) compared to the US (1.2 km/km2) ( ). Even greater
            divergence is shown when comparing Greece to the Netherlands (3 km/km2) (EEA 2002).
            These differences are even more striking considering the greater population density in
            Greece (85.3 persons/km2) in comparison to the US (31 persons/km2). Such differences in
            road density ( , ) are likely to reflect national policies ( ), urbanization,
            development and infrastructure ( ) but are probably also influenced by topographic
            factors as well as different historic paths in road planning and construction.
            Especially in Greece, roads mostly follow the tracks of ancient pathways, and several
            roads are known to have been in operation since ancient times ( ). The range of road
            density values observed in protected areas in Greece is comparable to that of the
            northern Great Lakes Region in North America ( ) and the native forest ecosystems of the
            US, which also include protected areas ( ). On the other hand, the high road density
            values (&gt;1.5 km/km2)found in certain Greek Natura 2000 sites are comparable to those
            of densely populated countries such as the US ( ), which is surprising considering their
            high conservation value. For instance, Olympia the original home of the Olympic Games is
            a Natura 2000 site (sitecode GR 2330004) with high road density (1.43 km/km2). </p>
         <p> Considering the conservation value of roadless areas and the sparse road network in
            Greece, one might intuitively expect that the majority or at least a high proportion of
            Greek protected areas would be roadless. Surprisingly though, protected areas without
            roads represent 15% of the studied sites,covering less than 3% of the area protected
            under the Greek Natura 2000 network. Nevertheless, these 32 roadless sites might play a
            significant role in future conservation efforts ( ).Many roadless protected sites are in
            mountainous areas. Although topography does not favour road construction in mountains,
            nevertheless this could be an artefact since no data on forest roads was available.
            There are also numerous coastal roadless areas which actually represent rocky islets or
            remote and possibly inaccessible coastal zones. Similarly, roadless wetlands are either
            of limited accessibility (located alongside a freshwater aquatic ecosystem subjected to
            seasonal rises in water level) or cannot be accessed at all (sites with riparian
            ecosystems whose deltas are large areas covered by sediment). </p>
         <p> Our results regarding the representation of roadless areas at different elevation
            ranges are in agreement with similar work in the US, where in many cases roadless areas
            occur at lower to mid-elevations ( ; ) as well as at mid to higher elevations( ).
            Similarly, road density in roaded sites showed no significant difference with altitude.
            The lack of correlation suggests that a combination of topographic features and
            anthropogenic factors influence the development of road networks, leading to complicated
            patterns ( ). However, human needs chiefly dictate road construction in Greece whilst
            topography or landscape characteristics are of less importance ( ). </p>
         <p> Several studies on road effects have used road density as an indicator for species
            presence or persistence and they have reported a significant range of critical values
            for different species( ; ; ). However, in the present study we focus on habitat type
            richness, not species presence. In reality, critical values could vary among landscapes
            depending on the scale of analysis, differences in history and evolution. Landscapes
            with long history of human presence, as in our case study, have coevolved with humans
            and currently support complex compositional and structural components of ecological
            biodiversity making the effects of roads less apparent ( ). Almost all Greek landscapes
            have been shaped, to a certain extent, by human activities, and semi-natural landscapes
            are often recognized as highly diverse areas ( ). In fact, part of the Greek road
            network, which intersects a large number of Natura 2000 sites, is known to have been in
            operation since antiquity ( ). Biodiversity conservation at the ecosystem level is
            advocated as a means to sustain both ecological processes and the species present (e.g.
            ). Therefore, we have focused on habitat types which include vegetation structure,
            biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Moreover, the Natura 2000 network was established
            explicitly for the preservation of natural and semi-natural habitats (see Habitats
            Directive 92/43/EEC). A better understanding of the effects of roads on habitat richness
            would result from an investigation of the habitat types in relation to non protected
            areas. However, such data is not available for Greece. </p>
         <p> A closer analysis for the sites with dense road network (&gt;1.5 km/km2) revealed that
            their high road density values are mainly attributed to their spatial characteristics
            (extent, shape) and intense human activity. These three sites are of relatively limited
            extent (0.4 to 4.96 km2) and have an elongated shape. One of these sites is a canyon,
            with elongated shape and small area (4.96 km2). The other two sites are located in the
            coastal zones of two highly populated islands popular with tourists. In these latter
            cases, the intense and permanent human activity in the area has resulted in a dense road
            system, without apparently affecting the area's ability to support a rich biodiversity.
            Nine out of the thirteen sites with road densities greater than 1km/km2 are areas where
            no conservation status was assigned prior to their incorporation in the Natura 2000
            network. This might imply that natural areas which host important habitat types but are
            not protected under national or European legislation, have been vulnerable to the
            expansion of the road network in Greece. </p>
         <p> Fragmentation metrics are advocated as a powerful tool for the quantification of
            landscape patterns ( ). Landscape division, splitting index effective mesh size and
            number of patches depict the process in a geometric perspective and they respond well to
            dissection as caused by roads ( ). Road density showed a strong relationship with all
            fragmentation metrics. Landscape division, splitting index and number of patches
            constitute patch-based indicators, which actually describe the degree of fragmentation
            in a landscape ( ). These are found positively correlated in our study area indicating
            landscape's degradation in terms of ecological processes ( ). In contrast, as road
            density increases, effective mesh size decreases; this also emerges landscape's
            degradation due to fragmentation ( ). Fragmentation metrics were differentiated in the
            case of effective mesh size as far as the ecosystem types are concerned. As already
            mentioned by , effective mesh size is an expression of the probability that two places
            in the landscape can be connected. In our case, it seems that forest sites constitute a
            separate category, with unfragmented areas, while freshwater and coastal ecosystem types
            follow a similar pattern, with a higher degree of degradation due to fragmentation. To
            sum up, our findings regarding road fragmentation come in accordance to relevant
            previous studies ( ; ) highlighting however, the diverging pattern of road fragmentation
            in forest ecosystem types. </p>
         <p> As far as the ecosystem types are concerned, we found that road density is associated
            with specific land use types. The classification of the 214 Natura 2000 sites in three
            basic ecosystem types was based on the prevailing habitat type (according to Annex I of
            the Natura 2000 database) in relation to the main land use type (according to CORINE
            Land Cover database) of each site. There are many cases where habitats present in a site
            might not be listed in Annex I. Thus we also used CORINE Land Cover database in order to
            identify the dominant ecosystem type in each site. Freshwater sitesshowed higher road
            density values compared to forest sites. Freshwater sites in Greece are frequently under
            human pressure since they share borders with fertile agricultural lands ( , ). Extensive
            cultivated fields require a dense network of roads, for both the access of heavy
            agricultural machinery and the transport of agricultural goods. Similarly, they indicate
            the existence of economically active local communities, thereby a high associated need
            for transportation and road infrastructure ( ). Intense human activity in many areas in
            Greece has resulted in dense road systems in certain sites included in the Natura 2000
            network, without however an apparent effect on the areas' ability to support a rich
            biodiversity, since road density is not significantly correlated to habitat richness.
            Despite the dense road network, the continuous human presence, lack of protection status
            and absence of management measures, the studied sites support numerous habitat types of
            conservation interest. </p>
         <p> According to our findings, a correlation between road density and habitat richness is
            lacking, which comes to contradict other studies ( ; ; ). Nevertheless, in these cases
            countries with high road densities were examined, while, in our study Greece
            demonstrates a low road density possibly explaining the absence of correlation.
            Alternatively, the choice of temporal and spatial scale for analysis might have
            influenced the patterns observed. Many authors have stressed the importance of
            identifying the right scale in time and/or space for ecological monitoring and impact
            assessment ( ; ). stress that there is usually a lag between road construction and
            ecosystem response, therefore considering the time dimension is essential when studying
            the effects of roads. Information on changes in habitat richness over time would allow a
            more detailed evaluation of possible road effects. However, such information was not
            available. In addition, we suggest that information regarding habitat richness in areas
            outside of the Natura 2000 network, might have also been valuable regarding the nature
            of the identified spatial patterns, therefore, similar studies should provide such
            analyses if this type of information is available. </p>
         <p> Another facet of consideration is the component of biological diversity that we chose
            to study (i.e. genetic, species, ecosystem, landscape level) ( ). Whilst previous work
            has shown that richness of a particular taxon may react immediately to anthropogenic
            changes (e.g. ), responses to the effects of road construction on a higher level such as
            species richness may not be immediately apparent ( ). We know that habitat richness in
            these sites affects species richness ( ); however, this does not necessarily mean that
            road effects are not manifested at the species level. </p>
         <p> Our focal area of interest in this paper has been habitat diversity, so we did not
            analyze habitat fragmentation, which in other cases has proven an important effect of
            the road network ( ). Finally, due to the lack of data we were not able to investigate
            the effects of traffic volume and speed, which often are of influence ( ). Perhaps road
            density per se is not a sufficient measure of the impacts of roads; traffic load
            information might have resulted in different findings ( ). This remains an open research
            question for future work. </p>

         <p>Conclusions</p>
         <p> Overall and despite the possible adverse effects of roads on species, we found that in
            Greek protected natural areas road density was not correlated to a site's habitat
            richness. This might indicate that currently the road density of Greek Natura 2000 areas
            is below a critical level and thus any adverse effects are not apparent. Alternatively,
            this could suggest that the long history of human presence might have ameliorated the
            adverse effects and through co-evolution a new semi-natural landscape of high diversity
            has been established. </p>
