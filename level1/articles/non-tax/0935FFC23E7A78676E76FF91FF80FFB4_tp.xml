                Abstract
            
        </title>
         <p> Vast amounts of Primary Biodiversity Data exist online (~ 109 records, each documenting
            an individual species at a point in space and time). These data hold immense but
            unrealized promise for science and society, including use in biogeographic research
            addressing issues such as zoonotic diseases, invasive species, threatened species and
            habitats, and climate change. Ongoing and envisioned changes in biodiversity informatics
            involving data providers, aggregators, and users should catalyze improvements to allow
            efficient use of such data for diverse analyses. We discuss relevant issues from the
            perspective of modeling species distributions, currently the most common use of Primary
            Biodiversity Data. Key cross-cutting principles for progress include harnessing feedback
            from users and increasing incentives for improving data quality. Critical challenges
            include: (1) establishing individual and collective stable unique identifiers across all
            of biodiversity science,(2) highlighting issues regarding data quality and
            representativeness, and (3) improving feedback mechanisms. Such changes should lead to
            ever-better data and increased utility and impact, including greater data integration
            with various research areas within and beyond biogeography (e.g., population demography,
            biotic interactions, physiology, and genetics). Building on existing pilot
            functionalities, biodiversity informatics could see transformative changes over the
            coming decade via a combination of community consensus building, coordinated efforts to
            justify and secure funding, and technical innovations. </p>

                Introduction
            
        </title>
         <p> A staggering amount of digital information regarding biodiversity now
            exists on the Internet, with many ongoing changes aimed at meeting the needs of science
            and society. Primary Biodiversity Data represent the principal information available for
            most species on Earth, consisting of individual records with place, time, and taxonomic
            identification ( Soberón and Peterson 2004 ). The
            biodiversity informatics community includes three overlapping groups interested in such
            data: (1) data providers , such as natural
            history museums, herbaria, and networks of citizen scientists; (2) data
                aggregators , initiatives that serve data combined from multiple
            providers; and (3) data
                users , including scientists, decision-makers, and the general public (
                 ; Graham et al. 2004 ). Integrated
            by standards such as the DarwinCore ( Wieczorek et al. 2012 ),
            enormous stores of Primary Biodiversity Data now exist online, with the Global
            Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF 1 ) constituting the largest
            and most comprehensive aggregator (&gt;1.4 x 109 digital records
            from&gt;1500 providers corresponding to&gt;2.3 x 106 species; Robertson et al. 2014 ). </p>
         <p>Ideally, Primary Biodiversity Data lead to synthetic knowledge and
            real-world applications, especially via association with information regarding diverse
            organismal</p>
         <p> attributes (e.g., measurements, images, recordings, and DNA sequences;
            and physiological, behavioral, ecological, or ethnobiological data; Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007 , Cook et al. 2016 ,
                Troudet et al. 2018 ;
                 ). Through diverse biogeographic
            and environmental research, Primary Biodiversity Data hold tremendous potential for
            applications to pressing environmental issues—such as understanding zoonotic diseases
            and invasive species,characterizing threatened species and habitats, planning
            conservation priorities, and anticipating effects of ongoing climate change (
                 ; Peterson et al. 2010 , Guisan et al. 2013 ,
                Hallgren et al. 2016 ,
                Johnson et al. 2019 ). Indeed,
            many major biodiversity assessments rely heavily on Primary Biodiversity Data and linked
            information or the results of studies that use them ( Pereira et
                al. 2010 , Sarukhán et al. 2015 ,IPBES
            2019). For all of these uses, relevant high-quality data must be readily available for
            efficient assembly, especially for time-sensitive issues such as an emerging zoonotic
            disease or recently detected invasive species ( Anderson 2012 , Johnson et al. 2019 ). However,
            several limitations currently constrain the utility of Primary Biodiversity Data, and we
            explain and advocate for ongoing and envisioned changes that could improve data quality
            dramatically and allow widespread realistic uses for basic and applied science. We
            provide examples through the lens of adequacy for modeling species distributions—for
            which they are most commonly employed—but the same issues and solutions hold for myriad
            other uses ( Graham et al. 2004 ). Although
            we take advantage of an ad
                hoc online consultation of the community conducted by the GBIF
            Secretariat (GBIF 2016; Table 1
            ), we cover issues germane to all aggregators. We provide several specific illustrations
            based on current functionalities of GBIF ( Robertson et al. 2014 ) but also
            point out innovations by some other aggregators. Below, we summarize principal current
            limitations in the field, outline ongoing and envisioned solutions, and sketch a roadmap
            for implementation. We begin by highlighting two critical cross-cutting principles for
            improving biodiversity informatics: harnessing feedback from users and promoting
            improvements in data quality. </p>

                Cross-cutting principles for progress
            
        </title>
         <p> Current and future users can provide the best information regarding
            Primary Biodiversity Data and its quality, and ongoing changes that link users,
            providers, and aggregators can help harness their feedback ( Suhrbier et al. 2017 ). Most aggregators
            integrate periodic updates from providers, adding new records and correcting previous
            errors. Additionally, users ofen invest substantial time and resources correcting
            taxonomic identifications and determining georeferences. Nevertheless, in both the GBIF
            community consultation and our discussions with colleagues, users indicated that: (1)
            most aggregated databases lack functionalities allowing users to flag problematic
            records or suggest improved information within the online interface; and (2) providers
            do not consistently update records based on user feedback (GBIF 2016, Suhrbier et al. 2017 ). Fortunately, the
            situation regarding the former is changing rapidly via pilot implementations, but
            changes are needed to increase the incentives and resources for the latter. </p>
         <p> The biodiversity informatics community can take various actions to
            promote improvements in data quality. Ofen with fixed or declining budgets, data
            providers (especially natural history museums and herbaria) juggle many priorities,
            including maintaining physical specimens and their associated data. To help increase the
            resources available for improving data quality, the field needs explicit information
            flows that document both data quality and use ( van Hintum et al. 2011 ).
            Importantly, indices of data quality can be tracked over time to assess progress and
            outstanding needs. Moreover, data usage represents a critical potential currency, with
            higher-quality information being used more frequently. The usage of individual Primary
            Biodiversity Data can be quantified via linkage with documentation of their use—for
            example downloading events and, most importantly, publications or reports based on them
            ( Costello et al. 2013 ).
            Standardized quantifications of data quality and use should both help justify
            improvements to data quality and increase incentives for both providers and funding
            sources to improve data quality. </p>

                Current
                    limitations
            
        </title>
         <p> Consideration of key
            data-related issues for models of species ecological niches and geographic distributions
            (hereafer distribution models) exemplifies current limitations of Primary Biodiversity
            Data for many kinds of biodiversity analyses ( Araújo et al. 2019 ).Distribution models integrate such
            data with environmental information to estimate the conditions and places suitable for a
            species ( Franklin 2010 , Peterson et al. 2011 , Guisan et al. 2017 ). Nevertheless, data
            from aggregated databases cannot be used in distribution modeling without substantial
            data-cleaning and filtering (to fix errors and remove records of insufficient quality),
            as well as consideration of inherent biases ( Beck et al. 2014 ,
                Gueta and Carmel 2016 ). Indeed,
            the DarwinCore standard was developed to include fields that characterize data
            limitations and promote appropriate usage ( Wieczorek et al. 2012 ,
                Otegui et al. 2013 ). However,
            current portals do not provide the functionalities necessary for researchers to assemble
            data suitable for such analyses efficiently, especially because various uses require
            different data quality needs (GBIF 2016, Veiga et al. 2017 ). As we
            outline briefly below, limitations that hinder the use of such data at present
            correspond to those that are: 1) inherent to the data, 2) affect access to the data, or
            3) relate to how the data are used. </p>
         <p> Limitations associated with Primary Biodiversity Data themselves include
            the lack of information,as well as inaccuracies and biases. As frequently mentioned, a
            few key information fields remain empty for a high proportion of digital records.
            Although copious records lack digitization or species-level identification, the greatest
            immediate obstacle concerns the lack of georeferences ( Hill et al. 2009 ,
                Beaman and Cellinese 2012 ,
                Peterson et al. 2015 ).
            Furthermore, records include inaccuracies and biases, which are well known but not yet
            rectified ( Meyer et al. 2015 ,
                Amano et al. 2016 ,
                Troia and McManamay 2016 ).
            Taxonomic misidentifications and inaccurate georeferences are highly problematic,
            compounded by the fact that fields regarding their uncertainty are almost always empty (
                Wieczorek et al. 2004 ,
                Guralnick et al. 2007 ). In
            addition,geographic and temporal biases in biological sampling effort pervade Primary
            Biodiversity Data (with some areas more heavily sampled than others, and effort varying
            greatly among years and to a lesser degree across annual seasons); such biases
            negatively affect distribution models unless taken into account ( Hortal et al. 2008 ,
                Phillips et al. 2009 ). </p>
         <p> Regarding data access, key information is seldom provided in transparent
            and easily accessible ways, leading to unrealistically high impressions of data quality
            as well as incorrect inferences regarding species ranges and their shifs over time (
                Araújo et al. 2009 ). Some data
            shielding rightly aims to protect sensitive species from exploitation, and temporary
            data “embargoes” sometimes protect research interests of those who collected the data (
                Brooke
                2000 , Graves 2000 ). However, existing information regarding
            the uncertainty of taxonomic identifications and georeferences—as well as
            characterizations of spatial and temporal biases—are not made immediately obvious to the
            user in current portals. This situation leads many non-specialists to
            misconceptions:that identifications and georeferences have little or no error; and that
            the lack of occurrence records for a species in a region or time period indicates its
            absence ( Ruete 2015 ). </p>
         <p> Limitations regarding data use correspond to both use per se as well as documentation. Commonly,
            researchers use data without adequate cleaning and filtering, ofen not realizing the
            high levels of error, bias, and uncertainty or the degree to which such problems
            adversely affect modeling analyses. Whereas substantial research has addressed issues
            related to error and bias in distribution modeling, the field needs substantial
            advancements regarding how to integrate and characterize information on uncertainty (
                Rocchini et al. 2011 ,
                Lash et al. 2012 ). With respect
            to documentation, distribution modeling is part of an ongoing transition in scientific
            research regarding data access and reproducibility. Increasingly, journals and funding
            sources require that data used in publications be made openly available (
                Molloy 2011 , Reichmen et al. 2011 ; e.g., Nature Scientific Data , Biodiversity Data Journal ). Whereas digital deposition is customary for
            some kinds of data (e.g., GenBank for gene sequences; DRYAD for more diverse data
                types ; Greenberg et al. 2009 ), no
            equivalent expectation or standard mechanism yet exists for Primary Biodiversity Data (
                Table 1
            ; Chavan and Ingwersen 2009 ,
                Costello et al. 2013 ,
                Guralnick et al. 2015 ).
            Similarly, recent years have seen dramatic increases in online supplemental information
            and external repositories to document methods and provide code ( Campbell et al. 2019 ). Unfortunately, distribution
            modeling studies still infrequently explain adequately the steps taken to obtain, clean,
            and filter Primary Biodiversity Data and to conduct analyses (or provide underlying
            code/workflows), but recent advances in automated documentation and metadata
            standardization greatly facilitate such goals ( Kass et al. 2018 ,
                Feng et al. 2019 ,
                Merow et al. 2019 ). </p>

         <p> Several initiatives by
            providers and aggregators are currently progressing towards the establishment and
            implementation of stable unique identifiers that allow clear links among data, both for
            individual records and collective sets of records (  ; Page 2008 ). Stable unique
            identifiers (e.g., Digital Object Identifiers) provide unambiguous, long-lasting
            reference to a particular entity—for Primary Biodiversity Data typically a voucher
            specimen or observation event. At the individual level, such identifiers help data
            providers receive and act on feedback from users or aggregators ( Table 1
            ) and also allow individual-level linkages both between records (e.g., parasite and
            host) and between data realms (e.g., Primary Biodiversity Data and gene sequences;
                Peterson et al. 2010 , Cook et al. 2016 ;
                 ). Fortunately,many aspects of such
            identifiers have been implemented for some individual aggregators, such as a universally
            unique identifier (UUID) automatically generated upon upload. Nevertheless, data
            providers and aggregators need to ensure that a given Primary Biodiversity Data record
            does not exist more than once under different identifiers (as currently happens in
            GBIF), for example via checks against other identifier fields in the DarwinCore.
            Furthermore, a broad consensus must be reached regarding mechanism to achieve a
            standardized identifier system that can be used across aggregators and throughout
            biodiversity science ( Guralnick et al. 2015 ,
                Suhrbier et al. 2017 , BCN 2018). We
            advocate for a single registry service to guarantee that a given identifier indeed is
            universally unique for all biodiversity uses ( Costello et al. 2013 ). </p>
         <p> The field also needs collective stable unique identifiers that each
            specify a list of individual-level identifiers. For example, a collective identifier can
            be used to denote all of the records in a particular download from an aggregator, or to
            all records used in an analysis (  ; Table 1
            ). Many aggregators (including GBIF) support the first functionality, but they and other
            aggregators currently lack the second (e.g., to receive and integrate information
            regarding a bundle of records). Collective stable unique identifiers for the records
            used in a particular analysis (e.g., afer
            data cleaning/filtering; Costello et al. 2013 ) or for a
            coherent dataset (e.g., sampled in a specific field survey effort) will provide a short
            way of denoting long lists of records; such identifiers will prove critical by
            facilitating </p>

        </title>
         <p> Wise and efficient use of Primary Biodiversity Data also depends on
            aggregators highlighting issues regarding data quality and representativeness. Users
            need easy and obvious access to fields documenting the reliability of identifications
            and georeferences (  ). Both are defined in DarwinCore (
                Wieczorek et al. 2012 ).
            Although most records currently lack any information for these fields, information
            regarding the latter has been populated densely in a few initiatives (e.g., VertNet
                2 and
            progenitors; Costello and Wieczorek 2014 ).
            Similarly, some citizen-science initiatives aim at providing flags based on plausibility
            upon upload (e.g., INFOFLORA 3 ) or have vetting processes built into their posting systems (e.g.,
            eBird 4 ).
            Developing tools that allow easy query and visualization of fields related to
            uncertainty will help users assess the appropriateness of records for the study at hand
            (  ; Chapman et al. 2020 ). </p>
         <p> To help users address issues related to sampling biases, aggregators
            also can facilitate construction and visualization of proxies for sampling effort across
            space and time (  ; Table 1
            ; Guralnick et al. 2007 ,
                Hortal et al. 2008 ,
                Otegui et al. 2013 ,
                Sousa-Baena et al. 2014 ).
            Records for a broad suite of taxa detected with similar techniques (“target groups” for
            field sampling) can provide a quantitative estimate of the efforts that yielded the
            records for the particular species of interest. Data for such target groups (e.g.,
            small, non-volant mammals) document the places and times where relevant efforts occurred
            and can be used to quantify indices that serve as proxies of sampling and its spatial
            and temporal gaps ( Anderson 2003 ). Some useful
            implementations exist for visual display of records from a given search. For example,
            the “Spatial Module” of Symbiota 5 ( Gries et al. 2014 ) provides a
            heat density visualization of records as well as a “Date Slider” that allows the user to
            control the display of records by date range. Aggregators should expand such
            functionalities to make querying, mapping, summarizing,and downloading such records an
            integral part of their online interfaces, allowing the user to customize the relevant
            target group by taking into account knowledge of relevant biological sampling protocols
            (  ). Such quantifications of sampling enable
            corrections for biases ( Phillips et al. 2009 ,
                Fithian et al. 2015 ), and
            indices of sampling </p>

                Figure 3.
                Examples of ways in which aggregators can make uncertainties and biases visually
                available to users of Primary Biodiversity Data. Such information can be employed to
                filter data and to quantify and correct for biases in sampling effort, respectively.
                (a) Georeferenced localities of a given species are simply plotted in geographic
                space (black dots; current practice). (b) Those same localities appear using
                symbologies that provide additional information; a hazy cloud indicates the radius
                of error for localities holding information regarding uncertainty of the
                georeference, and localities lacking such data appear only as hollow black circles.
                (c) Information appears that reflects the results of sampling effort, by showing in
                gray the georeferenced localities for all species belonging to a more inclusive
                target group (i.e., all species detected with the same techniques as the species of
                interest; conventions the same as in b). Note that the right-hand side of the study
                region lacks records for any species of the target group, suggestive of very low
                sampling effort there. </p>

                Improve feedback mechanisms
            
        </title>
         <p> Finally, aggregators can catalyze improvements in data much more
            effectively by implementing quality flags and annotations,as well as better
            quantifications of uncertainty.Automated data-cleaning efforts can discover, document,
            and flag some problems (e.g., geographic inconsistencies, spatial or environmental
            outliers, or disagreements with expert maps; García-Roselló et al. 2014 ,
                Robertson et al. 2016 ).For
            example, GBIF includes a series of known issues and flags discovered by checking
            procedures during integration (or populated by data providers). However, as mentioned
            earlier, the best information regarding data quality depends on the expertise of users (
                Peterson et al. 2004 )—both
            individual researchers (e.g., experts on a given taxon) and groups of users (e.g.,
            national biodiversity agencies; Table 1
            ; Guralnick et al. 2007 ,
                Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007 ). Specifically, aggregators can
            enlist users to detect and flag problems, suggest improvements, quantify quality, and
            provide annotations that document the information and methods employed. </p>
         <p> To facilitate such data improvements, aggregators have begun introducing
            functionalities that connect users and providers ( Suhrbier et al. 2017 ). The original
            architects of biodiversity informatics envisioned that users would notify providers of
            any issues with the data; providers would then evaluate that input and make changes to
            data records as they saw fit; and finally the modified records would be passed back to
            aggregators (and hence become available to users;  ; Soberón et al. 1996 ).In addition to that original
            feedback ‘loop’ of user → provider → aggregator → user, we characterize recent
            modifications as a ‘pendular’ feedback pathway of user → aggregator → provider →
            aggregator → user (  ). Just as users interact with aggregators
            to receive data from multiple providers, they can send information directly to the
            aggregator (regarding records corresponding to many providers). Simple implementations
            of such user feedback mechanisms already exist via open text boxes for commenting
            (including in GBIF) and should become much more structured (i.e., tied to particular
            fields). Afer inspection to remove spam, user feedback can lead to flagging and posting
            of suggested information and annotations in the database of the aggregator (visible to
            all users) and transmission of that information to the respective providers for
            consideration. As a complement to the original feedback loop,this pendular pathway
            maintains the primacy of decision-making by providers,enlists aggregators in
            facilitating information flow and availability, and allows users increased access to
            information regarding data quality and possible improvements. </p>

                    outlook
            
        </title>
         <p> If implemented
            widely,these ongoing and envisioned changes could prove transformational, catalyzing
            increased utility of biodiversity data for myriad scientific uses and applications (
                 ). Importantly, they should promote
            positive feedback patterns, leading to ever better data and concomitant increases in
            utility and impact. Implementing these changes can happen via a combination of community
            consensus-building, coordinated efforts to justify and secure funding, and technical
            innovations. Because biodiversity informatics depends on diverse data providers,
            aggregators, and users, the solutions must be feasible for all of these groups. Some
            advances likely will be achieved by large aggregators and others by smaller ones,
            yielding pilot implementations subsequently taken up across the field ( Canhos et al. 2015 ). We
            envision a set of initiatives: (1) to consolidate information regarding existing
            implementations (to determine what pilot examples exist for each challenge); and (2) to
            tackle necessary outstanding advances. In designing particular solutions, we suggest
            consultation with users regarding desired functionalities at the outset, and then again
            later to test and comment on prototypes. Below, we sketch a roadmap for
            implementation,organizing items by how quickly they might feasibly be implemented (6–24
            months, vs. 2–4 years). </p>

                Short-term deliverables
            
        </title>
         <p>Likely one of the first achievable advances, web interface development
            for well-funded aggregator portals can highlight the uncertainties and biases of
            existing data. This includes making the uncertainty of identification and georeferencing
            for each record obvious to users—including the lack of any such information in a data
            record. It also entails functionalities to specify relevant target groups (to
            characterize the results of past sampling), as well as extending functions for mapping
            and downloading such information. As an example, some innovative implementations for
            visualizing spatial and temporal biases exist, ripe for expansion (e.g., in Symbiota’s
            “Spatial Module” described above).</p>
         <p>Simultaneously,aggregators can summarize simple statistics of data
            quality—benchmarks to guide, justify, and assess future improvements. For example, GBIF
            calculates several summary metrics for given providers and higher-level taxonomic
            groups. In future developments, portals can implement temporal benchmarks for various
            taxa, geographic or political entities, and data providers. In addition to doing so for
            higher-level combinations of these categories, we suggest flexibility so that users can
            tailor reports to their needs. The existence of information regarding species-level
            taxonomic identification, georeferencing, and their uncertainties constitute the most
            important fields to be assessed.We anticipate that such information will prove highly
            useful in advocating for increased investment in data completeness and
            quality.</p>
         <p> Additionally, implementation of stable unique identifiers that can be
            used universally across all of biodiversity science constitutes a short-term deliverable
            that will enable many other advancements (  ). This requires final consensus
            among multiple data providers, aggregators, and external databases (likely including a
            registry to guarantee uniqueness),followed by widespread execution ( Guralnick et al. 2015 ). Once
            achieved for individual-level identifiers, the same protocols can be modified to
            implement collective ones. Such advances should facilitate development of a community
            standard for expected digital deposition of Primary Biodiversity Data used in
            publications and reports ( Table 1
            ). In addition to allowing efficient documentation and quantification of data use, these
            functionalities will also prove essential for medium-term deliverables regarding
            feedback mechanisms and links to diverse external databases. </p>

            few years, efforts to determine desired functionalities and identify technical needs and
            solutions should begin now. First,</p>
         <p> interested data providers, aggregators,and user groups can reach
            consensus regarding the data fields to be included, mechanisms for users to provide
            feedback to aggregators, and technical vision for how information will be transmitted to
            aggregators and then to and from providers. We anticipate that feedback from users will
            include at least: flags for likely taxonomic misidentifications, suggested corrected
            identifications, level of taxonomic expertise of the person identifying the species (for
            uncertainty of the identification field), flags for questionable georeferences,
            suggested new or improved georeferences, and estimated uncertainty of georeferences—as
            well as annotations regarding the data and resources used and an overall level of
            confidence regarding the quality of the record (  ; van Hintum et al. 2011 ).
            Technical issues to be resolved by aggregators will include how to provide the flags and
            alternate information, automate the sending of such feedback to providers, and remove
            flags and alternate information if a provider makes the change. Likely, the solutions
            for many of these issues will leverage functionalities already implemented in GBIF for
            some simple standardized flags regarding data quality. Critically, the feedback system
            also will need to track the history of feedback for each record. </p>
         <p> Such feedback machinery could include properties of existing open
            community platforms that have reputation rewards systems (for example, stackoverflow
                6 for
            the coding community) or more generally online forums such as reddit 7 ). For biodiversity
            informatics, individual ‘actors’ associated with data providers (e.g., museum
            curator/collection manager, field collector/observer) could have a login ID and receive
            a notification when a user provides feedback. Similarly, each user wishing to provide
            feedback could have a login ID; it also would be possible to implement a system in which
            such users develop ‘reputations’ based on community responses to their posts. Many
            complicated issues come with online forums, including the need to filter spam, and data
            providers and aggregators undoubtedly will consider user reliability carefully (see user
            registry protocols in Symbiota 5 ). </p>

                Outlook
            
        </title>
         <p>Given concerted engagement by the biodiversity informatics community, we
            think that many funding agencies, philanthropies, and other organizations supporting
            biodiversity research and conservation will embrace investments that lead to improved
            data quality and quantification. Specifically, we foresee successful proposals by groups
            of stakeholders to develop innovative plans regarding vision and mechanics (where
            necessary), as well as follow-up ones for implementation.In the immediate term, many
            entities regularly fund working groups and workshops (relevant for developing detailed
            plans for needed solutions), either via open calls for proposals or as supplements to
            current grants. For implementing solutions, various existing funding calls support
            biodiversity databasing</p>
         <p>and cyberinfrastructure; critically, we predict that funding agencies
            will also participate in this rethinking of biodiversity informatics by modifying and
            expanding their calls to reflect and promote the changing landscape of the
            field.</p>
         <p> Once enabled by stable unique identifiers and valuable information
            regarding data quality and use, aggregators will be able to catalyze critical data
            improvements to a degree long envisioned but not yet possible ( van Hintum et al. 2011 ).
            Aggregated databases will be highly useful for identifying bundles of Primary
            Biodiversity Data records particularly worthy of improvement, as well as for identifying
            gaps in data availability to be filled via targeted initiatives ( Meyer et al. 2015 ,
                Lobo et al. 2018 ). Ofen
            taxonomic and/or geographic in nature,such characterizations can focus and justify
            efforts to improve the availability and quality of Primary Biodiversity Data (
                Stein and Wieczorek 2004 ,
                Sousa-Baena et al. 2014 ).
            Indeed, institutions and consortia of users with common interests and expertise will be
            particularly well poised to secure funds for collective data improvement initiatives (
                Anderson 2012 , Tobón et al. 2017 ). For
            example, institutions and researchers interested in a particular applied topic (e.g.,
            arthropod-borne zoonotic diseases in a given region) should be able to make strong
            justifications for the benefits of a cooperative project ( Peterson 2015 ). We envision similar
            situations regarding conservation biology and many other practical applications of
            Primary Biodiversity Data. In closing, we hope that data providers, aggregators, users,
            and funding organizations will collaborate to build upon recent advances, leading to
            high-quality biodiversity data widely available for addressing issues of importance to
            science and society. </p>
