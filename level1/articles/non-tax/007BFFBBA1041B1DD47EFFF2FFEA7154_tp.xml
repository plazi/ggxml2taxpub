         <title> INTRODUCTION </title>
         <p> Faunistic surveys are the basis for obtaining reliable species lists to be used for
            macroecological analyses, pivotal to understanding the correlates and determinants of
            global biodiversity ( ; ). Extensive faunistic data sets exist only for well-studied
            taxa, which typically means only for large animals such as vertebrates and some
            arthropods (e.g. ; ). When dealing with understudied animals, faunistic studies and
            species lists are not adequately comprehensive and useful, so that any inference based
            on those records may be biased by our inability to correctly describe biological
            diversity ( ; ). Moreover, the reliability of these data sets may be even lower for
            cases in which taxonomy is not completely resolved and complexes of cryptic species are
            present. </p>
         <p> One of the animal phyla for which the morphological approach has failed to lump
            distinct entities under a single name is the <tp:taxon-name>Rotifera</tp:taxon-name> ( ;
            ; ; ). Within rotifers, the species complex <tp:taxon-name> Brachionus plicatilis
               Müller, 1786 </tp:taxon-name> (Monogononta,
               <tp:taxon-name>Brachionidae</tp:taxon-name> ) is a textbook example of the large
            amount of diversity, which remained hidden or unclear using only morphological taxonomy.
            With a morphological approach (reviewed by ), a certain amount of variability was known
            for <tp:taxon-name> B. plicatilis </tp:taxon-name> , mirrored in a number of subspecies,
            varieties, and species of doubtful taxonomic validity. , , and started clarifying such
            variability, identifying two morphotypes (L, large and S, small). supported the formal
            reestablishment of the names <tp:taxon-name> Brachionus rotundiformis Tschugunoff, 1921
            </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>B. plicatilis</tp:taxon-name> sensu stricto ( s.s .)
            for the S and L morphotypes, respectively. Subsequently, more size-forms were detected (
            ), and officially described as independent species ( ; ): <tp:taxon-name> Brachionus
               ibericus Ciros-Pérez, Gómez &amp; Serra, 2001 </tp:taxon-name> , as a medium-sized
            morphotype, and <tp:taxon-name> Brachionus manjavacas Fontaneto, Giordani, Melone &amp;
               Serra, 2007 </tp:taxon-name> , as another species in the L morphotype category. The
            extensive work carried out on this species complex through the application of a wide
            array of genetic tools and markers improved our knowledge of its diversity. Such works
            included analyses of microsatellite ( ) and allozyme ( ) loci, sequences of cytochrome c

         <p> Several localities were screened for the presence of the <tp:taxon-name> B. plicatilis
            </tp:taxon-name> species complex in Iran ; the species complex was found in six water
            bodies located in the West Azarbaijan and Hormozgan provinces, described in ( Table 1 ,
            Supporting Information Appendix S 1). The sampling was carried out from October 2007 to
            October 2008 . The specimens were collected by filtering the littoral waters through
            fine-mesh (30–50 μm) plankton net . Rotifer resting eggs were isolated from the surface
            sediments, collected during the seasonal drought or freezing, by using the sucrose
            floatation technique ( ). The resting eggs were hatched according to . Taxonomic
            identification was performed by using the standard keys for the genus and the recent
            species descriptions ( ; ; ). Drawings were obtained for each clonal culture . </p>

         <p> Clonal cultures were established starting by inoculation of single amictic female
            rotifers from each population into 24-well Plexiglas tissue-culture microplates
            containing the water taken from their natural habitats. The animals were then acclimated
            to the laboratory culture conditions with water salinity of 15‰, temperature of 25 °C,
            pH of 7–7.5 and feeding on <tp:taxon-name> Chlorella vulgaris </tp:taxon-name> . The
            rotifer cultures were then maintained in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks to provide adequate
            samples for the experiments. Clonal cultures were all kept under the same laboratory
            conditions in order to minimize the possibility that differences in body shape could be
            ecologically related, e.g. phenotypic changes resulting from local temperature,
            salinity, or chemistry. </p>

         <p> A quantitative morphometric approach describing the shape of the lorica was applied to
            identify distinct lineages in selected clonal cultures belonging to the <tp:taxon-name>
               B. plicatilis </tp:taxon-name> species complex. Nine linear dimensions were selected
            for the measurements according to ( Fig. 1 ). For each of the selected clonal lines,
            about 20 egg-bearing amictic females were haphazardly taken from the cultures. This
            procedure was carried out to maximize the within-group variability and to allow us to
            identify the discriminatory variables that would perform better between groups, even
            with large within-group variability. The animals were anaesthetized with marcaine ( ),
            observed under microscope slides, and linear measurements taken from each of the animals
            under a compound Nikon microscope at 20–40 × magnification. </p>
         <p> The linear measurements were analysed through discriminant analyses. In order to
            identify the most plausible number of potential taxonomic units from the morphometric
            approach, we used the Calinski criterion from a K -means partitioning ( ) using a range
            of values of K (different groups) from 2 to the number of analysed clonal lineages. The
            K -means was performed on the axes of the linear discriminant analysis obtained from
            untransformed measurements, using the clonal lineages as the class for each observation.
            The discriminant analysis was performed in R 2.14.0 (R ) with the functions lda of the
            package MASS 7.3–16 (http://cran.r-project.org/ web/packages/MASS/index.html) and the K-

         <p> Single rotifers were taken from each clonal culture and rinsed in distilled water to
            remove waste and uneaten algal cells. DNA extraction was performed by using the approach
            of : single rotifers were transferred into PCR tubes containing 20 μL of 6% Chelex 100
            resin (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK ) and 5 μL proteinase K. The mixture were then
            heated at 55 °C for 2 h, while being vortexed every 10 min, then boiled at 100 °C for 10

            °C), 0.01% Tween-20 buffer, and 0.125 U of Taq DNA polymerase (CinnaGen, Iran ). The
            primers for the amplification were LCO1490 (5′-GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG- 3′) and
            HCO2198 (5′-TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAA AAATCA-3′) ( ). PCR cycling conditions were as follows:
            denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 46–48 °C for
            1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min, followed by a post-amplification incubation at 72
            °C for 7 min. The reactions were performed in a Bioer XP ( China ) thermal cycler. The
            PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel against a 1 kb DNA
            ladder to ensure the production of the expected fragments. A volume of 25 μL of each
            amplified fragment was sequenced by BioNeer ( South Korea ). Chromatograms were
            controlled by eye and sequences checked and edited with MacClade 4.08 (http://
            macclade.org/), looking for potential reading errors such as frame shifts, stop codons,
            and gaps. </p>
         <p> In order to identify the species in the <tp:taxon-name> B. plicatilis </tp:taxon-name>
            species complex found in Iran , we used a DNA taxonomy approach, in the framework of
            previously published sequences and information. The DNA sequences that we obtained (
            Table 2 ) were aligned with all the available COI sequences for the <tp:taxon-name> B.
               plicatilis </tp:taxon-name> species complex in GenBank ( Table 3 ). The complete data
            sets were then reduced to haplotypes only, in order to avoid redundancy. The alignment
            for COI in rotifers is trivial, as no insertions or deletions are present; thus, a text
            editor was used to obtain the alignments. </p>
         <p> Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed to look for evidence of independently evolving
            entities with a maximum likelihood approach ( ). The selected model of evolution for the
            phylogenetic reconstructions was Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano+Invariant+ Gamma (HKY + I + G),
            chosen by Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) in MODEL
            GENERATOR v. 0.85 ( ). This model was implemented in BEAST v. 1.6.1 ( ), including an
            uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock with estimated rate and coalescent prior as
            suggested by for DNA taxonomy with COI data sets. The analysis was run for 50 000 000
            generations, keeping all other default settings, and the first 20% of trees were
            discarded when obtaining the consensus tree. The rotifer <tp:taxon-name> Epiphanes senta
            </tp:taxon-name> (GenBank accession DQ089728 ) was used as outgroup. The generalized
            mixed Yule coalescent (GMYC) model ( ; ) was then applied to test for the presence of
            cryptic species. The method uses a maximum likelihood approach to optimize the threshold
            identifying the shift in the branching patterns of the gene tree from interspecific
            branches (Yule model) to intraspecific branches (coalescent). It identifies clusters of
            sequences corresponding to independently evolving entities. The maximum likelihood
            approach also provides a 95% confidence interval around the maximum likelihood solution.
            We used the conservative approach of identifying the minimum number of entities within
            the 95% confidence interval in order not to over-split the species complex. The GMYC
            model was performed with the R package splits 1.0–11
            (https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/splits/). </p>
         <p> </p>
         <p> In order to compare the results of DNA taxonomy and the morphometric data, we assessed
            the number of individuals correctly predicted as belonging to the different DNA taxonomy
            units (GMYC entities) on the basis of the axes of the discriminant analysis on the
            morphometric variables. This was carried out with the function predict.lda of the R
            package MASS , using the identity of the DNA taxonomy units as the grouping variable.

            to the S morphotype (adult lorica length &lt;200 μm). Such bimodality in lorica length

            Overall, 187 animals were measured (Supporting Information Appendix S2). The

            separated groups of clonal lines ( Fig. 4 ). The Calinski criterion on the K -means
            partitioning gave two groups as the best solution ( Fig. 5 ). The two groups
            corresponded almost perfectly to the L and S morphotypes: all S individuals ( N = 61)
            clustered in one group, and 122 out of 126 L individuals (96.8%) clustered in the other

            individuals. Repeating the K- means partitioning separately for the L and the S

         <p> Our faunistic survey of the <tp:taxon-name> B. plicatilis </tp:taxon-name> species
            complex in Iran provided evidence of four different taxa from DNA taxonomy, whereas only
            two morphotypes, corresponding to the S and L types , could be unambiguously identified
            from discriminant analysis on the morphometric data. Once DNA taxonomy identified the
            four potential entities, morphometrics supported the existence of such entities with
            relatively ◀ </p>
         <p> </p>
         <p> The case of the <tp:taxon-name> B. plicatilis </tp:taxon-name> species complex may well
            be an extreme instance of hidden diversity; almost every study employing a molecular
            approach identifies new clades that could be putative new species ( ; ; ; ). Along the
            same lines, we here identify the new strain B03, closely related to B. ‘Tiscar’. The
            GMYC model supports the identity of the new lineage from Iran as an independent entity;
            the genetic distances to its most closely related species are above 8%, even higher than
            what is known between species of rotifers and of other animals, usually above 3% ( ; ; ;
            ). Our study also suggests that two other strains, B. ‘Cayman’ and B. ‘Nevada’, should
            be split. It has to be noted, however, that the GMYC model had a fairly large confidence
            interval for its solutions. Between 22 and 44 entities could be supported, and it is
            already known that this model can provide unclear results in specific cases ( ; ). We
            chose the most conservative estimate of 22 taxa. This choice includes entities that are
            comparable to previous studies and that are supported by cross-mating experiments ( ). </p>
         <p> Our study confirms that the <tp:taxon-name> B. plicatilis </tp:taxon-name> complex is
            species-rich, and that further work should still be performed on its ecology,
            biogeography, and taxonomy at all levels to unravel the actual diversity within the
            complex. The relatively limited number of analysed populations did not allow us to
            statistically analyse and support any ecological or biogeographical pattern.
            Nevertheless, our data will be useful for future meta-analyses gathering such
            information for a larger data set. </p>
         <p> There is an urgent need to stabilize the large number of unofficial names that have
            been given to the genetic lineages, to prevent taxonomic confusion, given that they are
            not valid and cannot be used unambiguously. The large amount of unexplored and
            unresolved diversity is rather surprising, given that this taxon has attracted lots of
            attention and funding because of its use as food for fish farming ( ; ), and as a model
            system for various biological studies including cyclical reproduction ( ; Stelzer, 2011)
            and dormancy resistance ( ; ). The existence of large amounts of hidden diversity in the
            taxon should be carefully considered when ecological and/or evolutionary inferences are
            made based on the differences amongst studies; there is always the possibility that
            distinct species within the species complex have been considered in different studies.
            Thus, a precise assessment of the identity of the cryptic species of <tp:taxon-name> B.
               plicatilis </tp:taxon-name> through a DNA taxonomy approach, now available as COI
            and/or ITS1 gene polymorphism, should always be provided, given that the morphological
            features and the morphometric parameters of the lorica (as suggested in our study) and
            even the shape of the trophi (e.g. ) are insufficient for correct identification of the
            taxon. </p>

         <p> Appendix S1. Map of Iran and position of sampling localities. Sampling sites of two
            rotifer strains (Ti and Ba) are shown on the southern part of the country. Refer to
            Table 1 for abbreviations. </p>
         <p> Appendix S2. Original measurements (a−i) in micrometres for the 187 animals of the nine
            clonal lineages of <tp:taxon-name> Brachionus plicatilis </tp:taxon-name> used in the
            study. </p>
         <p> Appendix S3. Output of the K -means partitioning and choice of the best fit according
            to the Calinski criterion. Analyses are limited to (A) the large and (B) the small
            morphotypes within the <tp:taxon-name> Brachionus plicatilis </tp:taxon-name> species
            complex. The colour codes for the K -means partitioning identify the identity of each
            individual (objects on the x -axis) in the groups from 2 to 9 on the y -axis.
            Individuals are numbered from 1 to 187 as in Appendix S2. The most likely value of the
            criterion is marked in red. </p>
