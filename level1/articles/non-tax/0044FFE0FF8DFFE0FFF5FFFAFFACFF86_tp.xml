         <p> Abstract </p>
         <p>Iran is known as the most complex and varied country in southwest Asia, in terms of
            geography, vegetation, climate and consequently biological diversity. The rather high
            number of recorded endemic species of Fulgoromorpha in Iran indicates a high potential
            for speciation in some areas.</p>
         <p>In this study, in order to identify the endemic zones for Fulgoromorpha of Iran, three
            main biogeographic regions of the country were divided into 13 primary zones, mainly
            according to the distribution of published and unpublished locality records of endemic
            species. Using Venn diagrams and cluster analyses on the primary zones, 6 final endemic
            zones were recognized: Caspian zone, southern slopes of Alborz, Zagros Mountains, Kerman
            Mountains, Khorasan Mountains, and Baluchestan and Persian Gulf coasts. Then a
            similarity map was produced for endemic zones using a Multidimensional analysis (Alscal)
            and the differences between the positions of the same zones in the similarity and
            geographic maps were discussed.</p>

         <p>Introduction</p>
         <p> Iran is located in southwest Asia between the latitudes of 25°30' and 40° north and the
            longitudes of 44° and 63°30' east and has a surface area of 1,648,195 square kilometers.
            It is limited by central Asia, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains and Aras River to the
            north, Anatolian Plateau and Mesopotamian region to the west, Persian Gulf and Oman Sea
            which is connected to the Indian Ocean to the south and Afghanistan and Pakistan to the
            east. The major part of the land of Iran is covered by the Plateau of Iran, a triangle
            between the Alborz Mountain Range in the north, the Zagros Mountains in the west and the
            Sulaiman Mountain Range in Pakistan and Afghanistan. </p>
         <p> According to Manuel , the continental crust of Iran has been originally developed by
            some complex movements which made the plate of the Alborz and central Iran and then the
            Zagros and Arabian plate detach from the Gondwana supercontinent in the southern
            hemisphere, drift northwards and attach to Eurasia from Permian to late Miocene.
            Consequently some parts of the old Tethys have been recognized in some parts of the
            country (Ghorbani 2002). </p>
         <p> In terms of biodiversity richness, Iran is considered as an extremely complex area and
            wide ranges in the extremes of altitude (below sea-level in shores of the Caspian sea to
            5,770 m of the Damavan Mt.), climate (humid and nearly jungle-like forests in the north
            to arid places in Dasht-e Lut with less than 100 m annual rainfall) and temperature
            (from -35°C in the north west to 70°C in the deserts of Dasht-e Lut) ( , , ). The high
            biodiversity of the Iranian fauna is also the result of its location and the influences
            of four ecozones from north (Palaearctic and old periodical connections with the
            Nearctic by Bering Strait), south (Afrotropical from the Arabian Peninsula) and
            southeast (Oriental) ( ). </p>
         <p> Biogeographic studies in Iran have been carried out mainly on plants ( , , , , ). Those
            studies recognized three main biogeographic regions in Iran which are usually applied as
            useful framework and references in analyses: Hyrcanian, Irano-Turanian and Nubo-Sindian
            and also a small area in the west of Iran which is touched by the Saharo-Arabian region
            according to (Fig. 1). </p>
         <p> The oldest zoogeographic division was performed by , an ornithologist who organized
            some trips to different parts of Iran during 1884-1904 and divided Iran into 9 zones:
            South Caspian Sea, Northwest, Khorasan, Kerman, Southwest, Sistan, Baluchestan, Karun
            plains and South coasts. In 1968, Anderson recognized 13 zones in his extensive study on
            endemic lizards of Iran: the central plateau, the Urmia basin, the Sistan basin, the
            Caspian region, the Khuzestan plain and Persian Gulf coast, Baluchestan and Makran
            coast, the Turkmen steppe, the Mogan steppe, the Zagros, the western foothills of the
            Zagros, the Kope Dag, the Alborz, the Islands of the Persian Gulf. considered Iran in
            the Sethian Desert Region in his Palaearctic biogeographic divisions and showed 2
            subregions inside Iran: Sahara-Arabian (Makran mixed and Sind plane) and Irano-Turanian
            (Middlear Eastern mixed (Armenian and Zagrossan), Hyrcanian Mountain, Iranian Mixed and
            Khorasan Mountain). classified different habitats in Iran and described the origin of
            studied Auchenorrhyncha species in three groups: arboreal, eremian and oreal. </p>
         <p> A total of 235 species of Fulgoromorpha have been recorded from Iran since 1902 ( ),
            117 of which from 13 families have never been recorded from other parts of the world and
            are restricted to the borders of Iran according to our knowledge. The high endemism
            (nearly 50%) in the recorded fauna of Iran shows a high potential of speciation inside
            Iran. The aim of this study is recognizing distribution patterns and endemic areas for
            endemic species of Fulgoromorpha in Iran. </p>

         <p>Materials and methods</p>
         <p> A total of 473 locality records of 117 species of planthoppers endemic to Iran were
            gathered, 416 of which derived from publications, 48 were newly collected and identified
            species in the Hayk Mirzayans Insect Museum (HMIM), and 9 were studied in the Zoological
            Institute of the Russian Academy of Science (ZIN). Due to the lack of the exact locality
            data of 3 endemic species: <tp:taxon-name>Phantia lactea</tp:taxon-name> Rusiecka, 1902
            ( <tp:taxon-name>Flatidae</tp:taxon-name> ), <tp:taxon-name>Phantia
               putoni</tp:taxon-name> Rusiecka, 1902 ( <tp:taxon-name>Flatidae</tp:taxon-name> ) and
               <tp:taxon-name>Oliarus convergens</tp:taxon-name> (Melichar, 1902) (
               <tp:taxon-name>Cixiidae</tp:taxon-name> ), they were deleted from further analyses.
            Then the distribution maps were prepared using Arc Map 9.3. and the country was divided
            into 13 primary zones according to the distribution of the endemic planthoppers,
            topography, climate condition and published zoogeographic zones (Fig. 1). Venn diagrams
            and cluster analyses were performed using Gliffy venn diagram software and NTSYS (2.02g)
            ( ) to find the relationship between those primary zones and to identify the final
            zones. The input data for cluster analyses were qualitative data: 1 and 0 for presence
            and absence of any species in any division, respectively. The similarity between final
            endemic zones was shown by a similarity map using a multidimensional scaling analysis
            (Alscal) by SPSS. </p>

         <p>Results and discussion</p>
         <p>Hyrcanian district</p>
         <p> This is a small area in northern Iran, from the Caucasian-Euxino-Hyrcanian province of
            the Euro-Siberian region ( ). The district is limited to the Alborz Mountain and Caspian
            Sea, stretches from Talesh in Azarbaijan in the west to Gorgan in the east and
            characterized by predominantly deciduous forests. </p>
         <p> The district is considered as one zone (Caspian zone) in this study. Fifteen endemic
            planthoppers of Iran have been recorded from this zone, 9 of which are endemic to the
            region (Table 1 and Fig. 2). The high and wall-like Alborz Mountain separates the south
            coast of the Caspian Sea from the Irano-Turanian region. This barrier not only prevents
            the fauna from migrating to south parts but also limits the high humidity of the Caspian
            Sea to the north and produces two very different climatic regions in the northern and
            southern slopes which can be considered a major factor for differentiating the fauna of
            north Iran from other parts of the country. Most of the Iranian endemic species common
            between Hyrcanian and other regions are limited to the Alborz Mt. and are distributed in
            areas very close to the borders of the Hyrcanian district. <tp:taxon-name>Malenia
               masirica</tp:taxon-name> Dlabola, 1986 ( <tp:taxon-name>Derbidae</tp:taxon-name> ) is
            the only endemic planthopper recorded in all three main regions. There are only a few
            records of the presence of this species in Iran which belong mostly to the southern
            Zagros, the Nubo-Sindian region, close to Irano-Turan, and one record of a female
            specimen from the north of Iran, all made by , and the specimens are deposited in
            Prague. <tp:taxon-name>Morsina persica</tp:taxon-name> Melichar, 1902 (
               <tp:taxon-name>Nogodinidae</tp:taxon-name> ) is the only endemic planthopper common
            between the Caspian zone and the Nubo-Sindian in spite of the distance and lack of
            records in the Irano-Turanian. The species was originally described from south east of
            Iran by and there are also other published and unpublished records of this species from
            there, deposited in HMIM. However the only record of the presence of this species in the
            Hyrcanian district is made by and he mentioned the species as an eremian faunal element
            which can be often found as oreal. According to this reference, the only specimen of
            this species from the north of Iran belongs to the museum of Plant Pests and Disease
            Research Institute, Tehran-Evin which is the former name used for HMIM, while it is not
            mentioned in the list of museum specimens ( ) and is not currently existing in this
            museum either. However another specimen of this species is deposited in the HMIM museum
            collected from southeast of Iran, by the same collector and in the same date mentioned
            by Dlabola's northern specimen. Therefore the presence of this species in the Hyrcanian
            district is doubtful and appears to be a mistake in recording the locality in . </p>
         <p> </p>
         <p> Historically, the north of Iran was occupied by the old Tethys 55-20 mya (Ghorbani,
            2002) so the occupation should have occurred after the area got dry. During the Pliocene
            ice age (100,000 years ago) the region was used as a refugee, and species spread
            northwards after the ice age, which may be a reason for rather small numbers of endemic
            species in this region. also indicated rather small numbers of endemic Phanerogamic
            plants in this area. However the area has a considerably different climate and fauna
            from other parts of Iran and has been considered as a separate zoogeographic division
            both by , and . </p>
         <p>Saharo-Arabian region</p>
         <p> According to , the west of Iran is touched by the Saharo-Arabian region. Short and mild
            winters and long and dry hot summers are typical for this part of the country ( ). Two
            endemic planthoppers of Iran ( <tp:taxon-name>Callodictya kazeruna</tp:taxon-name>
            (Dlabola, 1986) ( <tp:taxon-name>Dictyopharidae</tp:taxon-name> ) and
               <tp:taxon-name>Phantia helleri</tp:taxon-name> Linnavuori, 1962 (
               <tp:taxon-name>Flatidae</tp:taxon-name> )) have been recorded from this part while
            the former is in common with other parts of the Irano-Turan (Zagros Mt.) and the latter
            has a rather wide distribution in the Irano-Turanian and Nubo-Sindian regions (Fig. 2).
            Hence this region is not considered as an endemic zone in distribution patterns of
            endemic planthoppers. </p>
         <p>Irano-Turanian region</p>
         <p>The region covers nine tenths of the land of Iran and major parts of the Iranian
            Plateau, from central to south of Asia. The region consists of plains, deserts and
            mountains which are divided into 8 primary divisions in this study: Kerman, Karkas Mt.,
            Humid Zagros, Dry Zagros, North Khorasan Mt., South Khorasan Mt., Southern slopes of
            Alborz Mt. and Deserts and Plains.</p>
         <p>Kerman Mountains</p>
         <p> The complex of the Kerman Mts located in the southeast of the Irano-Turanian region and
            partially in the Nubo-Sindian (Fig. 1). The mountain range is a part of the Zagros chain
            but far from the other mountains and surrounded by deserts. The mountain and the deserts
            around have been considered as a zoogeographic zone by . Twenty eight endemic
            planthoppers of Iran were recorded from this mountain range, 8 of which endemic for
            there (Table 1, Fig. 3). The mountain range appears to be rather isolated from the
            Zagros and is limited by the Jazmurian lowlands in the south, Dasht-e Lut kavirs and
            other Irano-Turanian plains on the other sides. The isolation of mountains by plains and
            deserts creates a rather suitable condition for isolating populations and speciation.
            The high mountains in this complex (eg.: Hezar: 4,465 m, Lalehzar: 4,351 m, Tang-e
            Dalfard, 3,348 m) may be convenient places for relict species after the cold temperature
            of the Pleistocene ice age. However the fauna of endemic species is rather affected by
            both Nubo-Sindian (19 common species) and other parts of Irano-Turan (10 common species)
            (Fig. 3). </p>
         <p>Zagros mountains (Humid and Dry Zagros and Karkas Mt.)</p>
         <p> The Zagros mountain chain stretches from northwest of Iran to southeast near the Strait
            of Hormoz and is considered as the south branches of the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt
            ( ). The formation of the Zagros orogenic belt is subjected to controversy. Some
            geologists believe it has been made by the collision between the Afro-Arabian and
            Eurasian plate during the Cenozoic ( , ). As a result of this collision, several
            parallel folds were formed ( ). The long mountain chain divides the Mediterranean
            climatic zone from the arid regions of west Asia. It is also a barrier between
            Mesopotamia and the Plateau of Iran with some corridors for the distribution of the
            fauna between the two zones ( ). </p>
         <p> In this study the Zagros chain was divided into 3 primary zones (Fig. 1): "Humid
            Zagros" in the northwest which consists of higher mountains and is affected by
            Mediterranean winds, "Dry Zagros" in the southeast with a drier climate and rather
            isolated mountains as the result of wider parallel valleys, and the Karkas mountain
            which appears to be a rather isolated mountain surrounded by Maranjab kavir and other
            lower lands around. Two different zones in northwest and southeast Zagros are also
            applied by for distribution patterns of endemic phanerogamic plants, named:
            Armeno-Kurdic and Zagros, respectively. Similarly, recognized the northwest of Zagros as
            a separate zone with a fauna similar to the Caucasus. Northwest of Zagros, (Armenian)
            was mentioned as a different area from southeast of Zagros, (Zagrossan) in as well.
            However both of them were considered as divisions of "Middle Eastern mixed". </p>
         <p>A total of 36 endemic planthoppers of Iran have been recorded from Zagros Mts, 19 of
            which are endemic to the Zagros (Table 1), 17 endemic to Dry Zagros, and 2 in common
            with Dry Zagros and Karkas Mt. or Humid Zagros (Fig. 4). The Venn diagram (Fig. 4) shows
            there are no endemic species for Humid Zagros and Karkas Mt. and the fauna of Iranian
            endemic planthoppers in those primary zones are mainly in common with Dry Zagros and
            partially with the south Alborz and Caspian zones. Therefore, those two primary
            divisions of the Zagros Mountains are not considered as endemic zones. Differently from
            the wall-like Alborz Mt., the Zagros chain comprises series of parallel ridges and
            valleys. The distances between mountains increases from northwest to southeast. Although
            the wider lower lands between the mountains in the south of Zagros (Dry Zagros) form
            corridors for the distribution and migration of species, mountains surrounded by those
            lower lands can provide a vicariant condition for speciation or at least prevent the
            distribution of species to other locations. The fauna of endemic planthoppers in Dry
            Zagros has some species in common with the Nubo-Sindian (10) and Kerman Mt. (2) which
            can be explained by the rather short distance between them.</p>
         <p> Khorasan mountains </p>
         <p> It is believed that Iran has been connected to central Asia since the Oligocene. Then
            the plateau of Iran was uplifted during the Tertiary orogeny and consequently Kope Dagh
            (Northeast of Iran), Hindukush and Himalaya were created ( ). Mountains in northern
            Khorasan are a continuation of the Alborz but lack the wall-like integration of the
            Alborz and the humidity of the Caspian Sea, and mountains in both northern and southern
            Khorasan are rather parallel with the Zagros. In this study they were considered as
            different primary zones due to their distances and the distribution of endemic
            planthoppers. </p>
         <p>A total of 11 Iranian endemic planthoppers have been recorded from Khorasan Mts, 5 of
            which are endemic to this mountain range (Table 1), 3 in the south, 1 in the north and 1
            in common (Fig. 5). The cluster analysis shows the similarity of the northern and
            southern fauna (Fig. 6). Hence the two mountains can be considered as a same zone in the
            distribution pattern. While south parts, which are surrounded by Kavir-e Lut and Dasht-e
            Kavir to the west and lowlands in Afghanistan to the east, have more endemic species and
            appear to be more suitable places for speciation.</p>
         <p>Southern slopes of Alborz</p>
         <p> The Alborz mountain chain represents a north branch of the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic
            system ( ). It stretches from northwest of Iran to southeast of the Caspian Sea and
            includes the highest mountain of west Asia, Damavand 5,670 m. It forms a consistent
            barrier between the fauna of the Caspian zone and the Plateau of Iran. </p>
         <p> Seventeen endemic planthoppers of Iran are recorded from the south of Alborz, 12 of
            which endemic to the region (Table 1, Fig. 7). The southern slopes of Alborz have an
            absolutely different climatic condition from the northern Slopes due to the lack of
            corridors for receiving the humidity of the Caspian Sea. The presence of the Dasht-e
            Kavir desert in the south can be another factor for preventing the distribution of
            populations and probably speciation. There is only one common endemic planthopper
            between the southern slopes of Alborz and northern Khorasan whereas three species in
            common with the Zagros show a relationship with the western mountains. </p>
         <p>Deserts and plains</p>
         <p> Two big salt pans or Kavirs in central Iran are undrained basins and the lands
            surrounding them have typical features such as clayey or sandy soil and a high amount of
            salt on the surface. The inner lands of these salt marshes are nearly free of vegetation
            ( , , ). It is said that Dasht-e Lut is considered as the hottest place in the world
            exceeding 70°C of temperature in some parts of it ( ). There are marshes and mud grounds
            with large crusts of salt in inner parts of Kavirs while some parts have a steppe-like
            appearance and some other regions are surrounded by
               <tp:taxon-name>Tamarix</tp:taxon-name> spp.,
               <tp:taxon-name>Calligonum</tp:taxon-name> spp. etc. ( ). and recognized deserts and
            plains of the central Plateau of Iran as biogeographic zones. However did not mention
            them in his list. The distribution patterns of the Iranian endemic planthoppers appear
            to be very restricted in central Iran. <tp:taxon-name>Malenia masirica</tp:taxon-name>
            Dlabola, 1986, <tp:taxon-name>Mesophantia pallens</tp:taxon-name> Melichar, 1902 and
               <tp:taxon-name>Persepolia servadeina</tp:taxon-name> Dlabola , 1982 are the only
            endemic species recorded from this part of the country while none of them are endemic
            for those deserts. The two first species have a rather wide distribution in Iran and the
            third one has been collected so close to Kerman Mt. Few records of endemic Iranian
            planthoppers from the deserts may be simply because of less collecting in those dry
            areas or poor vegetation in some parts of them. None the less, according to our current
            knowledge, deserts and plains of the Irano-Turan cannot be considered as an endemic zone
            for planthoppers. </p>
         <p>Nubo-Sindian region</p>
         <p> This part of the country in southern and southeastern Iran is the only region which is
            not considered as Palaearctic but as a part of the Oriental. A varied terminology has
            been used for this region. used the term "Sahara-Sindian" to show a west to east
            continuum from southwest Asia to Send deserts while preferred Nubo-Sindian because they
            believed the distribution patterns of the Nubo-Sindian province are obvious here while
            Saharo-Arabian and Mediterranean species have migrated to this region. </p>
         <p> By subtracting the endemic species of a small part of the Kerman Mountain from the
            Nubo-Sindian, 54 recorded endemic species of Iran, which is more than half of the total,
            are distributed in this region and 32 of these are endemic to the region (Table 1). The
            distribution of endemic Fulgoromorpha shows three rather separate groups which are
            recognized as three primary zones here: Baluchestan, the Strait of Hormoz and the coasts
            of the Persian Gulf (Fig. 1). The cluster analysis showed the similarity of the fauna of
            the endemic species in the Strait of Hormoz and the Persian Gulf coasts (Fig. 8) so
            those two primary zones can be considered as a same zone. found a discontinuity in the
            faunal elements of southern and southeastern Iran and justified it with the relatively
            recent position of the Persian Gulf and lower sea levels during the Pleistocene which
            must have caused dry land contact between Iran and Arabia. This belief is confirmed by
            evidence for ecological continuity across the two sides of the Persian Gulf. Therefore
            the higher sea levels after the ice age can also produce a vicariant condition in the
            Persian Gulf coasts and isolating endemic species between mountains and a different
            climate condition to the north and the waters of the Persian Gulf to the south. The
            number of endemic species in the Nubo-Sindian is reduced from east to west which may be
            because of the isolation of the eastern species by the Kavie-e Lut and Jazmurian
            lowlands. On the other hand, the Venn diagram (Fig. 9) shows a rather high number of
            common species between Baluchestan and the two other adjacent areas. Hence according to
            our current knowledge of distribution patterns of endemic planthoppers, the Baluchestan
            primary zone can also be united with the other primary zones of the Nubo-Sindian region.
            The area was also considered mainly as one division (Makran mixed) with a very small
            area of Baluchestan in southeast (Sind plane) by . According to Ghorbani (2002), some
            parts of Baluchestan, the Strait of Hormoz and the area between them had been occupied
            by the old Tethys so the common endemic species between Baluchestan and two other
            primary zones in southern Iran should have crossed the area after drying. </p>
         <p> The final 6 endemic zones (Caspian zone, South slopes of Alborz, Khorasan Mts, Zagros
            Mts, Kerman Mts and Baluchestan and Persian Gulf coasts) are shown in Fig. 10. The
            cluster analysis on six final endemic zones of Iranian planthoppers (Fig. 6) indicates
            Baluchestan and Perisan Gulf coasts the only region which is considered as a part of the
            Oriental Region, as the most different zone from the others. Then Zagros Mts, Kerman
            Mts, Alborz, Khorasan Mts and Caspian zones are diverging, respectively. Alscal analysis
            produced a map according to the similarity of endemic zones. Rotating the similarity map
            canvas horizontally (Fig. 11), makes it more comparable with the geographic map (Fig.
            10). The Caspian zone and the Nubo-Sindian region are located in similar situations in
            both maps. While the Khorasan zone is closer to the Caspian zone in the similarity map
            rather than its geographic situation. This similarity can be justified by the
            possibility of specimens migrating between two zones at the end of the wall-like
            mountains of Alborz at the east of the Caspian zone. This is why the southern slopes of
            Alborz go farther in the Alscal map and confirms the efficiency of the barrier of the
            Alborz mountain in separating species of the two adjacent zones. Although the Zagros
            mountain has rather similar situations in both maps, it is farther from the Nubo-Sindian
            in similarity rather than its geographic situation. The reason may be the higher number
            of endemic species in Baluchestan rather than in the coasts of Persian Gulf and the
            Strait of Hormoz close to the Zagros Mountains. The situation of the Kermann Mts in the
            similarity map moved from its geographic situation towards the north. The rather far
            distance of this zone from the others, confirms the isolation of the species living
            there. However, deleting the doubtful record of <tp:taxon-name>Morsina
               persica</tp:taxon-name> , common between the Caspian zone and the Nubo-Sindian part
            of the Kerman Mountains may move the situation of the Kerman zone in the similarity map
            towards the south. </p>
         <p> The records of the endemic planthoppers of Iran belong to recent 110 years ( ). The
            nature of Iran, like any other land, has been exposed to various changes during this
            long period by events, such as agriculture, war, fire in woods and forests, overgrazing,
            urbanization and so on. Hence, probably the presence of some endemic species with a
            limited distribution and the probable extinction of some of them should be subjected to
            further investigations. </p>
