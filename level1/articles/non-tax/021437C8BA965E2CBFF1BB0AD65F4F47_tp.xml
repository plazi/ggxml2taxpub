         <p> Introduction </p>
         <p> In recent decades, it has become clear that biodiversity loss is an increasingly
            serious problem and many species are expected to become extinct before discovery and
            description ( , ). It is thought that only 226,000 of the estimated 0.7-1 million marine
            species have been described ( ). Poor sampling of marine fauna in biodiverse regions and
            a large backlog of species that have yet to be described have rendered most marine
            species unidentifiable and often unknown to science ( , ). This incomplete knowledge of
            species diversity prevents accurate biodiversity assessments and monitoring and limits
            our understanding of ecosystem functioning ( ). Determining species diversity, using
            traditional taxonomic techniques, requires skilled taxonomists to accurately identify or
            describe species based on detailed keys and careful study of morphology. However, this
            approach is manpower-intensive, slow ( ) and costly (approximately $39,000-122,000 per
            species; ). Consequently, alternative strategies are being developed to expedite the
            processes of species discovery and delimitation ( ). While convincing solutions for
            large-scale species description are lacking, the problem is starting to attract the
            attention of many animal taxonomists ( ). </p>
         <p> Molecular techniques have dramatically increased the rate of species discovery and
            facilitated species identification for those species that have been barcoded. DNA
            barcoding was initially proposed as a means to identify animal species, although it is
            now increasingly used for species discovery ( , , , ). This technique uses a short DNA
            fragment as a standard marker for species description and discovery. For metazoans, the
            mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) is the barcoding locus of choice,
            having been popularised by . However, as a prerequisite to successful species
            identification via barcodes, a comprehensively curated reference database is required (
            ). Public databases, such as GenBank ( ) and the Barcode of Life Data (BOLD) System ( ),
            collect such reference sequences and, while they contain many sequences for vertebrates
            ( , , ), the coverage for invertebrate species is more limited ( , , , , , ). These
            databases are continually updated as new discoveries are made and presently the BOLD
            System contains&gt; 5 million barcode sequences belonging to 262,679 species (as of
            December 2017). However, these identifications should be interpreted with caution,
            because many are for predicted species (Barcode Index Numbers; "BINS" ) and few
            specimens have been formally identified or verified as species ( ). Despite these
            potential issues, research is uncovering unexpected diversity for many taxa in many
            habitats ( , , , ). These discoveries further reinforce the utility of DNA barcoding in
            surveys of biodiversity ( ). </p>
         <p> For highly biodiverse regions such as Southeast Asia, these global reference databases
            remain particularly incomplete and poorly curated ( , ), partially due to the
            prohibitive costs associated with molecular sequencing ( ). The sheer number of species
            found in biodiversity hotspots also poses a considerable challenge, as many of the
            barcodes recovered differ from those in the databases by more than 3%, meaning accurate
            species identification is not possible for these animals ( ) and several of which may
            also be new species ( , ). These problems will only be resolved by greater sampling
            effort and expansion of curated databases. Unfortunately, a shortage of taxonomic
            expertise for biodiverse regions is compounded by a lack of the necessary skills
            required to perform the field collections, a consequence of the decline in biodiversity
            appreciation ( ). It is here that digital reference collections, such as "Biodiversity
            of Singapore" (https://singapore.biodiversity.online/), can make a difference by helping
            to stimulate an interest in biodiversity and conservation, with verifying putative
            species identifications ( , , ). </p>
         <p> Singapore is situated just outside the southwest corner of the biodiverse Coral
            Triangle biodiversity hotspot and, like other countries in the region, its marine
            biodiversity remains relatively poorly understood. To address this shortfall, we
            describe the first results of a programme that aims to build a comprehensive animal
            species identification database for Singapore's first marine park-the Sisters' Islands
            Marine Park (SIMP; Fig. 1 ). Prior to this study, preliminary estimates suggested that
            the SIMP may be home to&gt; 100 fish and&gt; 1,000 macroinvertebrate species (K. Tun,
            pers. obs.). Barcoding the fauna is part of a larger initiative to make Singapore's
            biodiversity identifiable with molecular tools and constitutes the first steps towards
            building a national genomic observatory ( ). Located approximately 6 km south of
            mainland Singapore, SIMP is recognised as a locally important area of biodiversity in
            terms of coral species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversity ( ). Previous
            work modelling coral larval dispersal has indicated that reefs in the area are
            potentially strong source reefs that can seed other reefs in Singapore ( , ).
            Furthermore, the marine park also aims to serve as an outreach platform to encourage
            public interest in marine life and participation in biodiversity conservation. It is
            open to the public and visitors can interact with the natural environment via guided
            intertidal walks and subtidal dive trails. Thus, a systematic and regular documentation
            of the biodiversity at the SIMP is important for the management and conservation of
            marine ecosystems in Singapore. SIMP was established as a marine park on 15 July 2015
            and spans an area of 40 hectares that encompasses the namesake Sisters' Islands (Pulau
            Subar Laut and Pulau Subar Darat), the western shores of Pulau Tekukor and Pulau
            Sakijang Bendera ( Fig. 1 ). </p>
         <p> The work performed here will help consolidate sampling records and molecular data
            obtained from the SIMP will form an important baseline for monitoring Singapore's marine
            species. It will also provide better and more complete understanding of marine
            biodiversity in Singapore, with further utility throughout Southeast Asia where work of
            this nature is still in its infancy and which is inadequately represented in global
            databases ( , ). Finally, it serves as a resource for future work relying on curated
            databases for species detection and discovery of species interactions, such as
            environmental DNA (eDNA) ( , , , , ). Given the rapid increase in interest in using
            molecular data for environmental monitoring in recent years ( , , ), these will likely
            have crucial applications for the conservation and management of marine resources. </p>

         <title>N/A</title>
         <p>Materials and Methods</p>
         <p>Literature review</p>
         <p> We first compiled existing records and published DNA barcodes relevant to SIMP through
            a literature keyword search for marine fauna found at the SIMP. Records for SIMP species
            predominantly came from two survey projects aimed at documenting and/or discovering
            local biodiversity (without DNA barcodes): (i) a large-scale 'Comprehensive Marine
            Biodiversity Survey' of Singapore ( ), which sampled marine fauna across Singapore using
            many different sampling methods, from hand sampling to dredging and (ii) a BioBlitz
            initiative by the National Parks Board of Singapore, which is a series of visual surveys
            involving volunteer scientists and members of the public (Suppl. material 1) that
            documented, for example, 105 scleractinian coral species at the SIMP. Barcode data for
            some of the species on the list were obtained via GenBank (109 species; Suppl. material
            2) and added to the SIMP database. </p>
         <p>Macrofauna</p>
         <p>Field collection</p>
         <p>Samples were collected from all four islands of the SIMP:</p>
         <p> Pulau Subar Laut (Big Sister's Island; 1.21417°N , 103.83444°E ),Pulau Subar Darat
            (Small Sister's Island; 1.215788°N , 103.832705°E ),Pulau Sakijang Bendera (specifically
            Tanjong Hakim; 1.213823°N , 103.851107°E ) andPulau Tekukor ( 1.232139°N , 103.836604°E
            ). </p>
         <p> Collections were authorised by the National Parks Board (permit number NP/RP15-088) and
            were carried out at the accessible intertidal reef, sandy beach, seawall and much of the
            shallow subtidal reef areas ( Fig. 1 ) over a span of two years from July 2015 to July
            2017. </p>
         <p> Intertidal specimens were obtained using hand tools and nets during low spring tides,
            0.0 m to 0.2 m above chart datum. These tools were likewise used for subtidal sampling
            via SCUBA diving to depths of up to 15 m. The search included around, under and inside
            potential hideouts. Any metazoans encountered during these visual surveys that were not
            already in our collection, were collected. Fish were collected using two 'bubu' traps,
            each measuring 0.072 m3, deployed twice, for periods of one day each, during the
            sampling period. Up to three individuals of each species were collected, avoiding gravid
            females and juveniles to reduce sampling impact on natural populations. </p>
         <p>Sample processing and imaging</p>
         <p> Samples were provisionally imaged in situ using a Canon Powershot G10 (Canon Inc.,
            Japan) or Olympus Stylus Tough TG-4 compact camera (Olympus Corporation, Japan). In the
            laboratory, invertebrate specimens were relaxed in 7.5% (w/v) MgCl2 buffered in seawater
            ( ), while fish specimens were handled according to NUS Institutional Animal Care and
            Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines (IACUC Protocol B15-1403). A Canon EOS 750D or a
            dissecting microscope (Leica S8 APO with Canon EOS 750D mounted; 1 -8x magnification)
            was used for specimen imaging. Tissue subsamples were then taken from each specimen
            before fixation or preservation. Hard-bodied specimens were preserved in 70% (v/v)
            molecular grade ethanol, while soft-bodied organisms were first fixed in 4% (v/v)
            formaldehyde overnight, then transferred to 70% ethanol for long-term preservation. All
            macrofaunal vouchers were deposited at the Zoological Reference Collection (ZRC) of the
            Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum (LKCNHM) as voucher specimens (Suppl. material 3)
            and the available image data made available online at the "Biodiversity of Singapore", a
            digital reference collection for Singapore's biodiversity
            (http://singapore.biodiversity.online; Fig. 2 ). </p>
         <p>Tissue subsampling, digestion and DNA extraction</p>
         <p> For each large soft-bodied specimen, a small piece of tissue (20-40 mm3) was excised,
            while for each arthropod, one to two legs from the same side of the body were detached
            for DNA extraction. The tissues were digested overnight at 55°C in 900 μl CTAB
            (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) with 0.4 mg proteinase K, after which DNA was
            purified by phase separation with phenol: chloroform: isoamyl-alcohol (25:24:1). </p>
         <p>COI barcode amplification</p>
         <p> The COI gene region was amplified using different primer pairs described in , , ,
            henceforth referred to as the 'Folmer' , 'Leray' and 'Lobo' primers, respectively.
            Reactions were performed using one of three mixes: </p>
         <p> BioReady rTaq DNA polymerase, 1 x reaction buffer (v/v) (Bulldog Bio Inc., China) with
            the Folmer primer pair targeting the 658-bp barcode region of the COI gene;GoTaq® DNA
            polymerase (Promega Corporation, U.S.A.) with the Lobo primer pair amplifying the same
            658-bp COI region; orGoTaq® Green Master Mix (Promega Corporation, U.S.A.) with the
            'Lobo reverse and Leray forward' primer combination targeting a shorter 313-bp COI
            region for samples that were particularly challenging to amplify. </p>
         <p> Most of the macrofaunal samples were subjected to Sanger barcoding. Each 12.5-μl
            reaction contained 0.5 μM of each primer (uniquely tagged primers for 46 samples only;
            untagged for the rest), 0.5 μg BSA (bovine serum albumin), 2 μl template DNA and 1 x
            GoTaq®/BioReady rTaq DNA polymerase and reagents mastermix (v/v), according to the
            manufacturer's recommendations. The thermal cycling profile for (1) using the Folmer
            primer pair was 94°C for 60 s; 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at
            48°C for 45 s, extension at 72°C for 90 s; and a final extension at 72°C for 3 mins. The
            thermal cycling profile for (2) and (3), using the Lobo primers, included a step-up
            annealing profile of 94°C for 60 s; 5 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 48°C for 120 s, 72°C for
            60 s; 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 54°C for 120 s, 72°C for 60 s; and 72°C for 5 mins. </p>
         <p>DNA barcoding using Sanger barcoding</p>
         <p> Successful PCR amplicons were purified using SureClean Plus (Bioline Inc., London, UK)
            and prepared for Sanger sequencing using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v.
            1.1 and PureSEQ (Aline Biosciences), on an Applied Biosystems 3730XL DNA Analyzer
            (Thermo Fisher Scientific, U.S.A.), following the manufacturer's instructions. COI
            barcodes, obtained via Sanger sequencing, were assembled and edited using Geneious R11
            v11.0.2 (Biomatters Limited) ( ). Although the cost of generating DNA barcodes with
            Sanger sequencing is expensive ( ), it was used for barcoding most macrofaunal samples
            since collections were conducted in numerous small batches (Suppl. material 3) that were
            too small for cost-effective barcoding via high-throughput sequencing (HTS). </p>
         <p>Zooplankton</p>
         <p>Field collection</p>
         <p> Sampling was performed at sites 1, 3 and 4 listed in the macrofaunal field collection
            section. A vertical plankton tow with a 100-μm mesh net was used to collect micro- and
            mesozooplankton ( ) upwards from a depth of 8 m. Zooplankton were concentrated into a
            50-ml bottle of seawater from each tow, put on ice and brought back to the laboratory
            for processing. </p>
         <p>Sample processing and imaging</p>
         <p> Samples were concentrated through a 100-μm sieve, preserved in 70% ethanol and stored
            at -30°C prior to sample sorting and imaging. Sorting and imaging were performed under a
            dissecting microscope (Leica S8 APO with Canon EOS 750D mounted; 1 -8x magnification),
            using soft fine forceps. Specimen identification followed and samples were preliminarily
            grouped into seven morphotypes at the phylum level (
               <tp:taxon-name>Arthropoda</tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>Annelida</tp:taxon-name> ,
               <tp:taxon-name>Chaetognatha</tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>Chordata</tp:taxon-name>
            , <tp:taxon-name>Cnidaria</tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>Mollusca</tp:taxon-name> and
               <tp:taxon-name>Platyhelminthes</tp:taxon-name> ). Each zooplankton was processed and
            stored individually in 70% ethanol in 96-well plates at -30°C. Zooplankton identities
            were later confirmed using DNA barcodes. </p>
         <p>Tissue subsampling, digestion and DNA extraction</p>
         <p> For larger arthropods, one or two legs from the same side of the body were detached for
            DNA extraction. For specimens &lt;5 mm in size, whole individuals were either used for
            phenol-chloroform extraction or were incubated in 20 μl of 2 x-diluted QuickExtract TM
            DNA extraction solution (Epicenter, BuccalAmp TM), following the manufacturer's
            instructions. </p>
         <p>COI barcode amplification</p>
         <p> Forty-six macrofaunal samples, along with all zooplankton samples, were sequenced using
            high-throughput sequencing (HTS; Suppl. material 4). PCR was performed on genomic DNA
            extracted using QuickExtract (Epicenter, BuccalAmpTM) or directly on selected samples
            for improved time efficiency ( ). A short 313-bp fragment of the COI gene was targeted
            using either the mlCO1intF and rmHCO2198 primer pair ( , ) or reaction mix (3) (see
            section on macrofaunal COI barcode amplification) with forward and reverse primers that
            were uniquely labelled with 9-bp tags (generated with online freeware "Barcode
            generator"; http://comailab.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/index.php/Barcode_generator) that
            differed from one another by ≥ 3-bp ( ). Each 20-μl PCR reaction contained 1 x GoTaq®
            Green Master Mix, 0.5 μM of each uniquely labelled primer and 2 μl of DNA extract. PCR
            thermal cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 60
            s, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 60 s, 47°C for 120 s, 72°C for 60 s, and 72°C for 3
            mins. </p>
         <p>DNA barcoding using high-throughput sequencing</p>
         <p> DNA barcoding via HTS ("HTS barcoding"; ) can be used to process a large number of
            specimens (e.g. zooplankton from bulk samples), using a reverse workflow where all
            specimens are barcoded and pre-sorted into MOTUs that are considered putative species
            awaiting verification by taxonomic experts ( , ). HTS barcoding is faster and more than
            one order of magnitude cheaper than Sanger barcodes ( ). Tagged amplicons were pooled
            into four libraries (NEBNext ® UltraTM II DNA Library Prep) for sequencing over five
            lanes of the Illumina MiSeq platform (v3; 2 x 300 bp; 25 million single reads). Note
            that these samples only took up 0.2% to 1.6% of each lane. HTS COI barcodes obtained via
            Illumina MiSeq sequencing were retrieved following the pipeline described in . Briefly,
            paired-end read data were assembled using PEAR version 0.9.6 ( ), data for individual
            samples were demultiplexed and dominant read sets per sample were identified. To ensure
            an accurate barcode database, the data were subsequently filtered for sequencing
            coverage&gt; 50, then filtered by a total barcode count of&gt; 10 and finally against
            potential contamination by retaining data where the dominant read set was at least four
            times as abundant as the second dominant read set for each sample (i.e. ratio of
            coverages of second: first dominant read ≤ 0.2). Samples, for which this ratio was
            &lt;0.35, were further evaluated to assess if their sequences could still be used (i.e.
            if barcodes were consistent with morphology). </p>
         <p>Matching zooplankton barcode identities to morphotype data</p>
         <p>Four criteria (C1-4) were used to select barcodes that we considered reliable. C1:
            Zooplankton morphotypes and barcode identities were congruent and samples had a good
            match (≥ 97%; giving species level identity) to global databases. C2: Barcode had a poor
            match (&gt; 85%; giving lowest taxonomic identity), but the match was consistent with
            the morphological sort. C3: In order to accommodate mistakes that may be made during the
            initial sort of zooplankton, we kept sequences for specimens, even when the morphotypes
            and barcode identities were incongruent as long as the BLAST match to an existing
            species in GenBank was high (≥ 97%) and the specimen images were consistent with the
            BLAST matches. C4: Specimens that failed to yield a barcode due to the violation of
            filtering thresholds were re-evaluated and retained when all of the following criteria
            were fulfilled:</p>
         <p>The ratio of first to second dominant read was 0.2-0.35;Sequencing coverage of&gt; 50
            reads and total barcode count of&gt; 10;The dominant read was ≥ 85% match to a taxon
            that was congruent to morphotype data (see C1); andThe second dominant read did not
            match the preliminary assigned morphotype.</p>
         <p>Sequence data analysis</p>
         <p> All sequence data were aligned using MUSCLE 3.8.425 ( ), translated and screened for
            stop codons using Geneious R11 v11.0.2 (Biomatters Limited) ( ). Only one specimen,
               <tp:taxon-name> Peronia verrculata </tp:taxon-name> (IP0136), was found to have a
            deletion of one codon compared to all other sequences. This deletion was confirmed
            against 63 other <tp:taxon-name> P. verruculata </tp:taxon-name> specimens previously
            collected in Singapore ( ). Data were subject to a final round of contamination check by
            comparing BLAST ( ) matches against GenBank ( ) and the Barcode of Life Data (BOLD)
            System ( ), for consistency with specimen morphology. BLAST matches were used to
            identify the specimens where query cover was ≥ 80%. The thresholds used were ≥ 80%
            identity for family, ≥ 90% identity for genus and ≥ 97% identity for species
            identification. It must be noted that these identities at family and genus levels were
            conservative, based on general interspecific distances which have been observed amongst
            various marine taxa ( , ), but should be treated with caution as supraspecific ranks are
            not consistently defined ( , ). Finally, an objective clustering method, with internal
            gaps treated as a fifth character, was used to group sequences into MOTUs, based on
            variable pairwise sequence similarities (Srivathsan, unpublished software;
            implementation of objective clustering described in ). One of the barcodes (IP0303), was
            excluded from this step due to a large internal gap that interferes with clustering.

         <p>Results</p>
         <p> Sampling at Sisters' Islands Marine Park (SIMP) yielded 931 specimens, comprising 564
            macrofauna (benthic and fish) and 367 zooplankton specimens ( Figs 3 , 4 , Suppl.
            materials 3, 4). Of all the specimens, 24.5% were identified by morphology to species,
            based on literature. They were included in a database of ca. 150 species that was
            assembled prior to barcoding. Most of the sampled fauna belonged to arthropods (38.9% of
            931 samples) and molluscs (21.0%), followed by cnidarians (9.5%) and annelids (8.3%) (
            Fig. 5 ). Fish were the least represented, with only 36 specimens (3.9%). </p>
         <p> Overall, COI amplification success was 68.0% across all phyla (633 out of 931 samples).
            A total of 297 of the sample barcodes (46.9%) were ≥ 658-bp in length (long; average
            length 677-bp), while 336 samples (53.1%) had sequence lengths varying between 229- and
            657-bp (short; average length 350-bp) (Suppl. materials 3, 4). No deletions, insertions
            or stop codons were observed in any of the COI sequences, suggesting that the data did
            not include nuclear DNA sequences, originating from mitochondrial DNA (NUMTs) ( ). </p>
         <p>Amplification and sequencing success were variable across different phyla and primer
            pair combinations. Molluscs were generally easy to amplify, while echinoderms were
            challenging and required more PCR optimisation. Specifically, primer pairs in reaction
            mix (1) yielded approximately 50% amplification success, reaction mix (2) gave
            approximately 80% success and reaction mix (3) yielded the highest amplification success
            at ≥ 95%.</p>
         <p>PCR amplification success for zooplankton samples was 70.6% (of 367 samples) and 259
            tagged amplicons were sequenced using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) barcoding. Due to
            uneven amplicon pooling, data for only 191 of these amplicons were retrieved, for which
            411,201 reads were demultiplexed and sequence quality filters resulted in coverage of 19
            to 4,048 reads per barcode. Overall, sequencing success was moderate, with 174 out of
            259 samples (67.2%) passing all filtering criteria. Of those failing the criteria, nine
            specimens were retained following criteria C4.</p>
         <p>Well-studied and morphologically distinct groups such as corals, sea anemones,
            echinoderms, molluscs and crustaceans were easily recognised, but most specimens could
            not be identified to species (75.3% unidentifiable; only 230 specimens were identifiable
            to 155 species by morphology) without DNA barcode-assisted identification. DNA barcodes
            obtained for 633 specimens clustered into 351-395 species dependent on clustering
            criterion (i.e. MOTUs), of which 83 specimens were identifiable only via DNA barcode (48
            species). This adds up to an approximately 36% increase in the number of specimens that
            could be delimited to at least species level.</p>
         <p> The final set of 633 COI specimen barcodes obtained clustered into 351 molecular
            operational taxonomic units (MOTUs, i.e. putative species). This was based on a species
            delimitation threshold of 3%, which was defined by assessing the percentage pairwise
            differences across all sampled taxon groups (Suppl. material 5). Clustering at 3%
            provides a conservative estimate of species, especially for
               <tp:taxon-name>Anthozoa</tp:taxon-name> -there may be up to 42 additional species of
            anthozoans and another species of <tp:taxon-name> Costasiella </tp:taxon-name> slug and
            synaptid sea cucumber (Suppl. material 5), bringing the final DNA barcode-based species
            count up to 395. Although barcodes for 305 of the 633 specimens were matched
            successfully (i.e. ≥ 97%) to global databases (Suppl. material 6), 49 of these matched
            to database sequences that were not identified to species (e.g. uncultured zooplankton
            and "sp." ), while another 28 were not congruent with our morphological identification.
            Hence, only 229 specimens (36.2% of 633) were successfully identified based on COI
            barcode matching alone, which represented 116 MOTUs/species at the 3% threshold.
            Morphological identification for 90 specimens without COI-based identification (&lt;97%
            identity match, ≥ 97% match to unidentified database sequences or mismatch to
            morphological identification) allowed for 304 specimen barcodes to be tagged with
            species names (48.0% of 633), which represented 149 species (Suppl. material 6). With
            the addition of a further 14 species, based on morphology alone, a total of 163 known
            species were identified across the 931 specimens collected at the SIMP. Ten of these
            were new (zooplankton) species records for Singapore. Including MOTUs not identifiable
            to species, we hereby report a total of more than 365 animal species collected from
            SIMP, based on morphological and/or genetic identifications. All sequence data have been
            deposited in GenBank (Accession numbers MN689967-MN690599) and BOLD. </p>

         <title>N/A</title>
         <p>Discussion</p>
         <p> In recent years, the process of species discovery has been enhanced with DNA barcoding
            approaches ( ). Relatedly, large-scale marine sampling programmes and expeditions such
            as the Moorea Biocode Project ( , ) and SANTO 2006 ( ), focusing on South Pacific
            islands, have expedited species discovery and diversity estimation. Such biodiversity
            sampling expeditions are important, not just for documenting biodiversity; the massive
            collections also provide material for improving our understanding of the evolutionary
            histories of various groups ( , , ). In this study, nearly one thousand specimens
            belonging to more than 365 marine animal species were collected and processed over 24
            months across 13 sites at the SIMP. These species represent ca. 300 macrofauna and 70
            zooplankton species, which include ten new (zooplankton) species records for Singapore
            and 58 species that are hitherto not included or misidentified in two of the largest
            global COI barcode databases (GenBank and BOLD). While morphological identification of
            most groups could be performed to the family level, species-level sorting and
            identification was a key challenge before the use of DNA barcoding. This was
            demonstrated in morphologically distinct groups that were easily recognised, where DNA
            barcoding resulted in approximately 36% increase in the number of specimens that could
            be delimited to at least species level. These advances underscore the importance of COI
            barcoding, especially for large-scale biodiversity surveys. </p>
         <p> The morphological study of small animals and zooplankton is particularly time-consuming
            because large numbers of specimens are usually collected (e.g. , ). This includes
            planktonic larvae, which are some of the most difficult developmental stages to identify
            and are traditionally reliant on laboratory-reared larvae to match juveniles with adults
            ( , ). Barnacles ( <tp:taxon-name>Cirripedia</tp:taxon-name> ) in the water column have
            never been identified to species before ( , likely because their planktonic nauplii tend
            to be morphologically similar between species ( ). In the present study, a combination
            of conventional sorting via microscopy and barcode matching to the GenBank database
            yielded new zooplankton species records for Singapore within just two plankton-tow
            samples. In particular, adult-larva matching was achieved for four barnacle species in
            the plankton samples, as all could be successfully identified to species by their DNA
            barcodes. Furthermore, planktonic molluscs have high potential for phenotypic plasticity
            and have been shown to exhibit cryptic speciation, displaying substantial morphological
            overlap between species and distinct morphotypes in different life stages ( , ). Being
            able to quickly associate larvae with adults using DNA barcodes is thus important to
            improve the sensitivity of species detection. Larvae typically provide a much larger
            pool of species' signals that can increase the chances of species detection than with
            adults, which may often be rare or go undetected when adult females are collected.
            Expanding beyond the usual morphological work on adult male specimens through the use of
            DNA barcoding allows for a more comprehensive understanding of species' ecology, such as
            their life histories and phenologies, since the life history stages of dozens of species
            can be cost-effectively matched in a single study ( ). </p>
         <p> Morphological identification can be challenging, even for charismatic animals due to
            the presence of cryptic species. Our analyses revealed at least two pairs of
            morphologically indistinguishable species with high COI sequence divergence. These
            possibly sympatric cryptic species groups include two <tp:taxon-name> Ligia
            </tp:taxon-name> isopods with a 22% pairwise distance, as well as two <tp:taxon-name>
               Peronia </tp:taxon-name> slugs ( <tp:taxon-name>Mollusca</tp:taxon-name> :
               <tp:taxon-name>Gastropoda</tp:taxon-name> :
               <tp:taxon-name>Onchidiidae</tp:taxon-name> ) with a 5.4% pairwise distance. In the
            latter case, have shown, using an integrative taxonomic approach, that <tp:taxon-name>
               Peronia </tp:taxon-name> onchidiids in Singapore form a cryptic species complex.
            Cryptic diversity in the SIMP onchidiids were initially confirmed via BLAST matches in
            which IP0287 and IP0136 matched 99.8% and 99.9% to <tp:taxon-name> Peronia
            </tp:taxon-name> sp. 2 and <tp:taxon-name> Peronia </tp:taxon-name> "Singapore Clade",
            respectively and corresponding morphological differences were found ( , ). More detailed
            morphological work is necessary to determine whether the <tp:taxon-name> Ligia
            </tp:taxon-name> species also belong to a species complex. </p>
         <p> Indeed, DNA barcodes can help with species delimitation and cryptic species detection.
            DNA barcodes also allow for obtaining abundance and distribution information, but they
            tend to be of limited value for their original purpose, i.e. species identification, as
            only 36.2% of barcodes obtained here had species-level matches. A substantial number of
            our sequences that were matched to GenBank sequences at &lt;90% identity yielded only
            very tentative genus- or family-level identities. Even well-studied and common taxa such
            as molluscs, arthropods and fishes (e.g. <tp:taxon-name> Hyselodoris </tp:taxon-name> ,
               <tp:taxon-name> Dendrodoris </tp:taxon-name> ,
               <tp:taxon-name>Ashtoret</tp:taxon-name> , Grapsus and Pomacentrus ) lacked barcodes
            in GenBank. Furthermore, in some taxa, the genus-level identities were of questionable
            accuracy. For example, amongst <tp:taxon-name> Alpheus </tp:taxon-name> shrimps, up to
            20 specimens were recovered in the incorrect lineage with &lt;90% identity, with the
            closest match being a <tp:taxon-name>Caridea</tp:taxon-name> sp. at 82% to 88% sequence
            similarity (Suppl. material 3). The same situation was observed with synaptid sea
            cucumbers ( <tp:taxon-name>Synaptidae</tp:taxon-name> ) which lacked close matches to
            GenBank sequences. Some of these problems can be overcome by building a local database
            for Singapore that is supported by reliable morphological identifications. </p>
         <p> The inadequacy of the barcode databases was particularly problematic for understudied
            groups such as annelids, platyhelminths, poriferans and zooplankton, such as
            chaetognaths. Amongst the 17 barcoded platyhelminth flatworm samples, for instance, all
            GenBank matches were &lt;88% in sequence identity and accurate only to the phylum level
            for 14 samples, while seven samples were assigned to the incorrect genus (see also ).
            Most platyhelminth flatworm studies use the 28S rDNA gene for phylogenetic analysis ( ,
            , , ) and thus few COI sequences are represented in the global databases. Furthermore,
            the commonly used barcoding region sensu does not overlap with the COI region that is
            informative for flatworms and thus lacks resolving power to delimit flatworm species ( )
            with the usual 3% barcoding threshold used across metazoans ( ). Amongst the zooplankton
            samples, we found up to 15 chaetognath MOTUs that could not be identified to species,
            either based on morphology or barcodes. Chaetognath species, such as <tp:taxon-name>
               Krohnitta pacifica </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> Aidanosagitta crassa
            </tp:taxon-name> , have been previously recorded in Singapore ( ) but both species still
            lack COI barcodes in GenBank. </p>
         <p> Overall, our study confirms that a substantial number of the sequences in the global
            databases are misidentified and that one should carefully distinguish between the use of
            the barcode sequences for, for example, obtaining distributional data and the use of
            barcode identification in the database. This is particularly important for understudied
            taxa ( ). For example, GenBank sequences of the copepod <tp:taxon-name> Paracalanus
               aculeatus </tp:taxon-name> had 100% matches to two different MOTUs which differed by
            an uncorrected p-distance of 9.3% (ZP011/ZP344 and ZP232 clusters). Conversely, a single
            cluster/sequence (e.g. ZP344) in our database matched at 100% to different
               <tp:taxon-name> Paracalanus </tp:taxon-name> species on GenBank, when compared to the
            BOLD database. Even well-studied taxa including fish, arthropods and molluscs, were not
            free from misidentification (e.g. )-poor identity matches were obtained for our
            specimens of <tp:taxon-name> Centrogenys vaigiensis </tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>
               Ashtoret lunaris </tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name> Jorunna funebris </tp:taxon-name>
            , for example, despite the presence of barcodes in GenBank that were filed under these
            names. We recommend that this gap be bridged by working with taxonomic experts in each
            pre-sorted group and, subsequently, supplementing local or global (i.e. GenBank, BOLD)
            databases with COI barcode sequences that are tagged with accurate species identities.
            This will facilitate future faunal identification studies. </p>
         <p> For more than a decade, the COI locus has been popularised for barcoding a wide range
            of metazoan species ( ). Small intraspecific variation coupled with correspondingly
            large interspecific variation in the COI locus amongst most metazoan species sometimes
            yield a 'barcoding gap' , which allows for accurate species identification using a
            generalised threshold of 3% between intra- and interspecific variabilities ( , ). In
            reality, the distinctions between intra- and interspecific distances vary amongst taxa
            and the barcoding gap may not be present ( ), especially in recently-diverged species (
            , ). Such overlap can be caused by slow evolution of COI in some taxa ( , , ),
            hybridisation events between sympatric species ( , ) or by high sequence divergence,
            coupled with morphological stasis ( ). In particular, delimitation at the species and
            even genus level is difficult for many anthozoans, platyhelminth flatworms and some fish
            because of the lack of COI divergence ( , ). For these groups, other markers need to be
            explored for DNA barcoding. To this end, combinations of different genes, including
            mitochondrial and nuclear loci, have been proposed and used for different groups of
            anthozoans ( ) and the 28S rDNA for flatworms ( , ). In anthozoans, species-level
            resolution is still limited due to frequent hybridisation ( ), resulting in low
            interspecific divergence ( , ), though these markers are possibly useful at the genus
            level ( ). Other mitochondrial markers such as cytochrome b ( , ), 12S rRNA ( ) and
            D-loop control region ( ) have been suggested for use on barcoding fish species.
            Phylogenomic analyses in these groups are emerging ( , , ) and the data will help in the
            design of taxon-specific nuclear markers for future DNA barcoding work. With reducing
            costs of high-throughput DNA sequencing, multiple-gene DNA barcoding should become
            viable in the near future, which can help improve the accuracy of species
            identification. </p>
         <p> The large number of species from many divergent lineages, examined here, would
            typically require a wide range of taxonomic expertise to sort the specimens into
            putative species, based on morphological data. This expertise was not readily available,
            so we use molecular tools for rapid and cost-effective species delimitation ( , ) and
            occasionally for species identification if sequences can be matched to
            accurately-identified databases. Eventually, this barcoding exercise would follow the
            reverse workflow described in , in which DNA barcodes act as precursory guides to direct
            the verification and evaluation by skilled taxonomists. While we have only managed to
            put names on 163 species, less than half of the&gt; 365 species delimited here ( Fig. 5
            ), the data have already spawned collaborations with various specialists to focus on the
            more understudied fauna. In particular, taxonomic work elicited by our results is
            ongoing or recently accomplished for taxa such as corallimorpharians ( ), corals ( ),
            anemones ( ) and onchidiid slugs ( , ), including potentially new species initially
            spotlighted by DNA barcodes generated here ( , , ). </p>
         <p> Our work here is only the beginning of further molecular ecological work in this
            biodiverse region. It follows recent, successful, large-scale biodiversity sampling
            exercises, such as the Moorea Biocode Project ( ), which has helped pave the way for
            numerous other biodiversity studies and related applications, such as environmental DNA
            metabarcoding ( , , ), uncovering microbial diversity ( ), estimating biodiversity ( ,
            ), standardised reef biodiversity sampling ( , ), larval species identification ( ),
            designing metazoan-specific primers ( , ) and mapping entire island ecosystems ( ) to
            designate genomic observatories ( ). We can leverage on the DNA barcode database built
            for the SIMP to motivate the development of applications for better documenting species
            diversity in the region, thus strengthening the case for developing the marine park into
            a genomic observatory. </p>
         <p> To understand why this is advantageous, we note that survey windows at the SIMP are
            limited in the intertidal areas by the tidal regime and in the subtidal by strong
            currents, so rapid and non-intrusive sampling methods such as environmental DNA (eDNA)
            would enable more regular surveys ( , ). To this end, our DNA barcode database could
            serve as the reference library for matching and discovering species found in eDNA
            samples. Exploratory eDNA experiments based on 26 two-litre water samples collected from
            eight localities have led to the detection of&gt; 500 metazoan MOTUs (Y.C.A. Ip, Y.C.
            Tay &amp; J.J.M. Chang, unpublished data). Notably, 20 of these MOTUs were matched only
            to our local database and not the global databases GenBank and BOLD. This is remarkable,
            given the large repository of&gt; 2.68 million COI sequences on GenBank. Indeed, the
            enhanced database resolution, resulting from thorough sampling at the SIMP, is crucial
            as eDNA has emerged as one of the main technology-driven tools for environmental
            monitoring and management. </p>

         <p>Conclusion</p>
         <p> The collection and barcoding of marine animals at Sisters' Islands and the surrounding
            islands began more than two years ago, at a time when these locations were designated
            Singapore's first marine park. This is part of a larger initiative to make Singapore's
            biodiversity identifiable, as well as to provide molecular identification tools for
            future work. Despite only a collection frequency of 34 times over a span of two years on
            foot and via SCUBA across a large 40-ha area and using only simple hand tools, nets and
            traps, our study managed to sample more than 365 species across a wide range of marine
            animals. A more systematic sampling approach, covering a larger area and using grabs,
            trawls, dredges and various nets will uncover greater diversity and more taxa, including
            infaunal and meiofaunal groups. </p>
         <p> Being able to quantify and identify species diversity is important for many reasons,
            including the provision of a community baseline against which future surveys can be
            compared ( ). It is particularly critical for making better-informed decisions with
            respect to coastal reclamation and urban redevelopment ( ), as well as monitoring the
            influx of introduced species. Records with geographic data are important for
            conservation when prioritising sites for protection ( ) and for allowing biogeographic
            patterns at the regional and even global scales to be uncovered more precisely ( , , ).
            Furthermore, our data comprise species records supported by linked photographic images
            and COI barcode sequences, potentially paving the way for more efficient biomonitoring
            applications such as eDNA testing. Fundamentally, these methods are revolutionising
            biodiversity studies, thus not only allowing scientists to discover species on Earth,
            but also allowing for more ready access to DNA-based identification via new small-sized
            sequencers whose use requires minimal amounts of laboratory equipment ( ). </p>
