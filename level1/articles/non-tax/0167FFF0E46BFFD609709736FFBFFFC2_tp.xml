         <p> Five undescribed bis(lauric acid-12-yl)lignanoates, liglaurates A–E, along with the
            known methyl and glyceryl 12-caffeoyloxylaurates were isolated from the rhizomes of
               <tp:taxon-name> Drynaria roosii Nakaike. Their </tp:taxon-name> structures including
            absolute configurations were determined by HRESIMS, NMR techniques, and ECD calculation.
            Liglaurates A–D were isolated as the racemates, among which (±)-liglaurate A and
            (±)-liglaurate B were synthesized by a metal-mediated oxidative coupling reaction and
            further resolved as the enantiomerically pure compounds. Liglaurates (+)-A, ()-A, (+)-B,
            ()-B, (±)-C and (±)-D exhibited remarkable cytotoxic activities against HeLa cell line,
            with the IC 50 values of 0.11 ± 0.02, 0.24 ± 0.01, 0.02 ± 0.00, 0.13 ± 0.02, 0.34 ± 0.07
            and 0.17 ± 0.01 μ M, respectively. </p>
         <p> Compounds (±)- 1 and (±)- 2 were also synthesized in this report. </p>
         <p> The fern <tp:taxon-name> Drynaria roosii Nakaike </tp:taxon-name> (
               <tp:taxon-name>Polypodiaceae</tp:taxon-name> ) is widely distributed in South China .
            Its rhizomes are used as the traditional Chinese medicine Gu-Sui-Bu for treatment of
            osteoporosis and bone fractures ( ). Previous studies indicated that the main components
            in <tp:taxon-name> D. roosii </tp:taxon-name> are flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, lignans
            and triterpenes ( ; , , , ; , , 2010). Among them, phenylpropanoids and lignans
            exhibited various biological activities, including anti-inflammatory ( ; ; ), cytotoxic
            ( ; ) and antioxidant ( ; ) activities, etc. Therefore, we conducted a study on the
            chemical constituents of <tp:taxon-name> D. roosii </tp:taxon-name> to search for more
            bioactive phenylpropanoids and lignans. Herein, we describe the isolation, structure
            elucidation and cytotoxic activity of five undescribed bis(lauric acid-12-yl)lignanoates
            that we named as liglaurates A–E ( 1–5 ) ( Fig. 1 ), together with the known methyl
            12-caffeoyloxylaurate ( 6 ) ( ) and glyceryl 12-caffeoyloxylaurate ( 7 ) ( ). </p>

         <p> Liglaurate A ( 1 ) was purified as a brown oil. The molecular formula of C 44 H 62 O 12
            was established by HRESIMS at m / z 805.4129 [M +Na] + (calcd. for C 44 H 62 O 12 Na,
            805.4133) with 14 degrees of unsaturation ( Fig. S1 ). The IR spectrum showed absorption
            for hydroxyl (3388 cm-1 ) and aromatic (1652, 1521 cm 1 ) functionalities. The 1 H NMR
            signals ( Table 1 ) at δ H (7.50, 6.76, 6.64, 6.56, 6.47, 6.41,4.39 and 3.91) and the 13
            C NMR signals at δ c (173.8, 167.7, 146.6, 143.8, 143.4, 142.9, 138.3, 135.2, 130.4,
            124.1, 122.3, 119.9, 116.1, 116.0, 115.3, 114.9, 47.7, 45.6) ( Table 2 ), as well as the
            UV spectrum at λ max ( 343, 314, 294, 252 nm ) indicated that compound 1 was extremely
            analogous to those of known lignan, 6,7-dihydroxy-1-(3 ′ ,4 ′
            -dihydroxyphenyl)-1,2-dihydronaphthalene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid ( ) that was renamed
            trivially as epiphyllic acid ( ). The </p>

         <p> skeleton was further confirmed by the key HMBC correlations ( Fig. 2 ) from H-7 ( δ H
            7.50) to C-9 ( δ C 167.7)/C-2 ( δ C 130.4)/C-6 ( δ C 116.1)/C-8 ′ ( δ C 47.7), from H-3
            ( δ H 6.56) to C-5 ( δ C 143.4)/C-1 ( δ C 124.1)/C-7 ′ ( δ C 45.6), from H-6 ( δ H 6.76)
            to C-4 ( δ C 146.6)/C-2, from H-2 ′ ( δ H 6.47) to C-4 ′ ( δ C 142.9)/C-6 ′ ( δ C
            119.9), from H-5 ′ ( δ H 6.64) to C-1 ′ ( δ C 135.2)/C-3 ′ ( δ C 143.8), from H-6 ′ ( δ
            H 6.41) to C-4 ′ /C-7 ′ , from H-7 ′ ( δ H 4.39) to C-8 ( δ C 122.3), and from H-8 ′ ( δ
            H 3.91) to C-9 ′ ( δ C 173.8)/C-2, along with the COSY correlation between H-7 ′ and H-8
            ′ . Except for the signals corresponding to lignan structure, the other NMR data (
            Tables 1 and 2 ) showed high similarities to the methyl 12-hydroxyllaurate, which was
            also present in the reported compound 6 ( Fig. 1 , Table S1 ). Two methyl
            12-hydroxyllaurate moieties and the lignan skeleton were connected by a diester group
            between 9,9 ′ -dicarboxylic acid and 12-hydroxyl, based on the key HMBC correlations
            from H-1 ′′ ( δ H 4.10) to C-9 and H-1 ′′′ ( δ H 3.98) to C-9 ′ ( Fig. 2 ). To further
            verify the structure, the tetra- O -methyl derivatives 1a was prepared by methylation
            with iodomethane. Compound 1a was then treated with sodium hydroxide to give 4,5,3 ′ ,4
            ′ -tetra- O -methylepiphyllic acid ( 1b ) and 12-hydroxyllauric acid ( 1c ) ( Fig. 5 ).
            The products 1a and 1b were identified by HRESIMS, 1 H and 13 C NMR data, while 1c was
            characterized by HRESIMS at m/z 215.16484 [M–H] – (calcd. for C 12 H 23 O 3 , 215.16417)
            (Fig. S53). The planar structure of 1 was thus established as shown in Fig. 1 . </p>
         <p> The coupling constant ( J = 2.4 Hz) between H-7 ′ and H-8 ′ was in accordance with
            trans -configuration ( ). Moreover, the NOESY correlation between H-8 ′ and H-2 ′ ( Fig.
            3 ) further indicated the trans -orientation between H-7 ′ and H-8 ′ ( Fig. 2 ). In
            addition, compound 1 was found to be a racemate according to the zero optical rotation
            and no ECD Cotton effect. It was then separated by semi-preparative HPLC on Cellulose-5
            chiral column to afford the optically pure enantiomers, (+)- 1 and ()- 1 (Fig. S58). The
            absolute configurations of (+)- 1 and ()- 1 were determined by ECD calculation using the
            time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level ( Fig. 4
            ). Considering the high conformational flexibility of 1 , the ECD calculation may impose
            high uncertainty. Compound 1b was therefore selected for further analysis. Similarly,
            compound 1b was found to be a racemate, which was also separated as the optically pure
            enantiomers, (+)- 1b and ()- 1b , by semi-preparative HPLC on Cellulose-5 chiral column
            (Fig. S58). The ECD calculation indicated that the absolute configurations of (+)- 1b
            and ()- 1b were (7 ′ S , 8 ′ R )- and (7 ′ R , 8 ′ S )-, respectively. Besides, similar
            Cotton effect of (+)- 1 with (+)- 1b , and ()- 1 with ()- 1b was observed ( Fig. 4 ),
            indicating that the fatty acid part has little effects on determination of the absolute
            configuration. Thus, the absolute configuration of (+)- 1 and ()- 1 were assigned as (7
            ′ S , 8 ′ R )- and (7 ′ R , 8 ′ S )-, respectively. </p>
         <p> To further verify the structure, compound (±)- 1 was synthesized from caffeic acid and
            12-hydroxyllauric acid ( Fig. 6 ). Methyl 12-hydroxyllaurate was first synthesized from
            12-hydroxyllauric acid in the condition of methanol and sulfuric acid. Then methyl
            12-caffeoyloxylaurate ( 6 ) was synthesized from caffeic acid and methyl
            12-hydroxyllaurate using Mitsunobu reaction. Finally, compound (±)- 1 was synthesized by
            a metal-mediated oxidative coupling reaction from compound 6 ( ), which was further
            resolved as (+)- 1 and ()- 1 as well (Fig. S58). Therefore, the structures of (+)- 1 and
            ()- 1 were respectively identified as (7 ′ S , 8 ′ R )- and (7 ′ R , 8 ′ S )- di
            (12-methoxy-12-oxydodecan-1-yl) epiphyllate. </p>
         <p> Liglaurate B ( 2 ) was isolated as a brown oil with the formula of C 48 H 70 O 16 from
            HRESIMS at m/z 925.4548[M + Na] + (calcd. for C 48 H 70 O 16 Na, 925.4556). The NMR
            spectroscopic data of compound 2 was very similar to those of 1 , only differed in the
            substituents at C-12’’/ 12 ′′′ . The 1 H– 1 H COSY correlations of H-15’’/15 ′′′ ( δ H
            3.35–3.33) and H-14’’/14 ′′′ ( δ H 3.64–3.61) through H-13’’/13 ′′′ ( δ H 4.03–4.01,
            3.89–3.87), as well as the key HMBC correlations ( Fig. 2 ) from H-13’’/13 ′′′ and
            H-10’’/10 ′′′ ( δ H 1.53–1.49) to C-12’’/12 ′′′ ( δ C 173.0), H-1 ′′ ( δ H 4.04) to C-9
            ( δ C 166.2), and H-1 ′′′ ( δ H 3.91) to C-9 ′ ( δ C 171.9) indicated that the glyceryl
            groups in 2 replaced the methoxy groups in 1 . This was evidenced from the synthesis of
            2 by a metal-mediated oxidative coupling reaction from compound 7 ( Fig. 7 ). Compound 2
            was also a racemate, which was further separated as the optically pure (+)- 2 and ()- 2
            on Cellulose-5 chiral column (Fig. S58). The same (7 ′ S , 8 ′ R )- configuration for
            (+)- 2 and (7 ′ R , 8 ′ S )- for ()- 2 were assigned according to the similar ECD
            spectra of (+)- 2 with (+)- 1 and ()- 2 with ()- 1 ( Fig. 4 ). Thus, structures (+)- 2
            and ()- 2 were respectively identified as (7 ′ S , 8 ′ R )- and (7 ′ R , 8 ′ S )-
            di(12-glyceryl-12-oxydodecan-1-yl) epiphyllate. </p>
         <p> The molecular formula of liglaurate C ( 3 ) was determined to be C 46 H 66 O 14 on the
            basis of HRESIMS peak at m / z 865.4351 [M + Na] + (calcd. for C 46 H 66 O 14 Na,
            865.4345). Its NMR spectroscopic data suggested a structural resemblance to 1 , with the
            only difference being the presence of a glyceryl signal in 3 instead of a methoxy signal
            in 1 ( Tables 1 and 2 ), which was confirmed by key HMBC correlations (Fig. S22) from
            H-13’’/13 ′′′ ( δ H 4.03–4.01, 3.91–3.89, 3.57) to C-12’’/12 ′′′ ( δ C 173.4, 173.0).
            This implied that compound 3 is a mix ester containing methyl and glyceryl groups. To
            further verify the 12-hydroxyllaurate and lignan skeleton, the tetra- O -methyl
            derivative was prepared and then treated with sodium hydroxide to give 1b and 1c using
            the same method as compound 1 ( Fig. 5 and S55). After subjected to HPLC separation on
            Cellulose-5 chiral column, (±)- 3 was also resolved as the enantiomeric (+)- 3 and ()- 3
            (Fig. S58). The configurations of (+)- 3 and ()- 3 were assigned as (7 ′ S , 8 ′ R )-
            and (7 ′ R , 8 ′ S )-, respectively, by the ECD consistency with (+)- 1 and ()- 1 ( Fig.
            4 ). However, the location of glycerol or methoxy group on C-12 ′′ or C-12 ′′′ could not
            be determined for the overlap of the two laurates signals around the carboxylate. Thus,
            structures (+)- 3 and ()- 3 were respectively assigned as (7 ′ S , 8 ′ R )- and (7 ′ R ,
            8 ′ S )- (12-glyceryl-12-oxydodecan-1-yl) (12- methoxy-12-oxydodecan-1-yl) epiphyllate. </p>
         <p> Liglaurate D ( 4 ) was isolated as a brown oil with the molecular formula of C 45 H 64
            O 14 from the HRESIMS peak at m / z 851.4182 [M + Na] + (calcd. for C 45 H 64 O 14 Na,
            851.4188). The NMR spectroscopic data suggested a structural similarity with compound 2
            , and the difference being only one glyceryl ester bonded to the 12-hydroxyllauric acid
            ( Tables 1 and 2 ). Using the same method as compound 1 , the methyl derivative was
            prepared and then treated with sodium hydroxide to give 1b and 1c ( Fig. 5 and S56) to
            confirm the 12-hydroxyllaurate and lignan skeleton. Like compounds 1–3 , compound 4 was
            also a racemic mixture and resolved as the enantiomeric (+)- 4 and ()- 4 by a
            semi-preparative HPLC on Cellulose-5 chiral column (Fig. S58). The configurations of
            (+)- 4 and ()- 4 were assigned as (7 ′ S , 8 ′ R )- and (7 ′ R , 8 ′ S )-, respectively,
            by the ECD consistency with (+)- 1 and ()- 1 ( Fig. 4 ). However, the location of
            glycerol on C-12 ′′ or C-12 ′′′ could not be determined for the overlap of the two
            laurates signals around the carboxylate. Thus, the structures of (+)- 4 and ()- 4 were
            respectively assigned as (7 ′ S , 8 ′ R )- and (7 ′ R , 8 ′ S )-
            (12-glyceryl-12-oxydodecan-1-yl) (12-hydroxy-12-oxydodecan-1-yl) epiphyllate. </p>
         <p> Liglaurate E ( 5 ) was isolated as a yellow oil with the molecular formula of C 44 H 58
            O 12 by a HRESIMS peak at m / z 801.3824 [M +Na] + (calcd. for C 44 H 58 O 12 Na,
            801.3820). The 1 H NMR signals ( Table 1 ) at δ H (8.04, 7.49, 7.29, 6.96 and 6.62) and
            the 13 C NMR signals ( Table 2 ) at δ c (169.7, 165.8, 148.7, 146.1, 142.0 × 2, 136.5,
            128.1, 125.9, 124.7, 124.1, 122.9, 121.2, 120.0, 119.8, 111.2, 108.8, 103.8) were close
            to arylnaphthalenoid lignan, mongolicumin A ( ). This deduction was supported from the
            key HMBC correlations ( Fig. 2 ) of H-6 ( δ H 7.49) to C-4 ( δ C 142.0)/C-7 ( δ C
            128.1)/C-2 ( δ C 122.9), of H-5 ( δ H 7.29) to C-3 ( δ C 136.5)/C-1 ( δ C 125.9), of H-7
            ( δ H 8.04) to C-9 ( δ C 165.8)/C-2/C-8 ′ ( δ C 119.8), of H-6 ′ ( δ H 6.96) to C-4 ′ (
            δ C 148.7)/C-2 ′ ( δ C 142.0)/C-7 ′ ( δ C 124.1), and H-3 ′ ( δ H 6.62) to C-5 ′ ( δ C
            146.1)/C-1 ′ ( δ C 108.8), along with the COSY correlation between H-5 and H-6. Except
            for the signals of mongolicumin A moiety, the other NMR data ( Tables 1 and 2 ) showed
            high similarities to the methyl 12-hydroxyllaurate unit that was also presented in
            compounds 1 and 6 ( Fig. 1 , Table S1 ). Two methyl 12-hydroxyllaurate moieties and the
            mongolicumin A moiety were connected by two ester bonds between 9,9 ′ -dicarboxylic acid
            and 12-hydroxyl, which was evidenced by the key HMBC correlations from H-1 ′′ ( δ H
            4.20) to C-9 and H-1 ′′′ ( δ H 4.33) to C-9 ′ ( δ C 169.7) ( Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, by
            the same procedure as compound 1 , the methylation of compound 5 followed by basic
            hydrolysis also provided 4,4 ′ ,5 ′ -tri-- O -methyl mongolicumin A and
            12-hydroxyllauric acid ( 1c ) from the HPLC-HRESIMS analysis (Fig. S57). Thus, the
            structure of compound 5 was concluded to be 9,9 ′ -di- O
            -(12-methoxy-12-oxydodecan-1-yl) mongolicumin A. </p>

         <p> In summary, apart from two known 12-caffeoyloxylaurates ( 6 and 7 ), five undescribed

            rhizomes of <tp:taxon-name> D. roosii </tp:taxon-name> . Compounds 1–4 were isolated as
            the racemic mixtures and further resolved into the enantiomerically pure compounds by a
            chiral purification. Compounds 1–4 were postulated biosynthesis from the [4 +2]
            cycloaddition reaction of two caffeates between Δ 6,8 (diene) and Δ 7,8 (ene) while
            compound 5 is from the [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between Δ 2,8 (diene) and Δ 7,8
            (ene) of the caffeates followed by oxidative dehydrogenation and intramolecular
            etherification ( Fig. 8 ). Among them, compounds (±)- 1 and (±)- 2 were synthesized by a
            metal-mediated oxidative coupling reaction. Compounds (±)- 1 –(±)- 4 and the optically
            pure (+)- 1 , (+)- 2 , ()- 1 and ()- 2 showed a selective cytotoxicity against HeLa cell

         <p> Theoretical calculations of ECD spectra for compounds 1–4 were performed with Gaussian
            09 ( ; ). The preliminary conformational distributions search was carried out by SYBYL-X
            2.0 software. The ground-state geometries were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level.
            The ECD of the selected conformers with distributions higher than 1% were then
            calculated by the TD-DFT method at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level with the PCM model in
            methanol solution. The calculated ECD spectra were produced by SpecDis 1.70.1 ( ). </p>

         <p> Cell proliferation was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Solarbio life sciences)
            method ( ). Cell suspension of 100 μ L was dispensed (5 × 104 cells/well) in 96-well
            plates. The plates were pre-incubated for 24 h, followed by the treatments of either
            DMSO (control) or various concentrations of compounds 1–7 with 10 μ M for RAW264.7 cell
            line, compounds 1–4 and positive control adriamycin with different concentrations (from
            10 μ M to 0.001 μ M) for HeLa, HCT-116, MCF-7, HepG2, MV4-11 and HEK293T cell lines. The
            96-well plates were placed at 37 ◦ C and cultured in a 5% CO 2 incubator for 72 h.
            Aspirated the old medium, and directly added the 10-fold diluted CCK-8 (100 μ L)
            solution to each well of the plate and incubated the plate for 3 h in the incubator. The
            absorbance was measured at 450 nm using an absorbance microplate reader (Thermo
            Scientific MULTISKAN MK3). The optical density values of each well represented the
            survival/proliferation of cells. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) is
            defined as the concentration within 50% inhibition. </p>
