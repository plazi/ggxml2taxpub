            ).PLoS ONE 10 ( 5 ): e0125847. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0125847 </p>
         <p> This work tested whether or not populations of <tp:taxon-name> Bombus brasiliensis
            </tp:taxon-name> isolated on mountain tops of southeastern Brazil belonged to the same
            species as populations widespread in lowland areas in the Atlantic coast and westward
            along the Paraná-river valley. Phylogeographic and population genetic analyses showed
            that those populations were all conspecific. However, they revealed a previously
            unrecognized, apparently rare, and potentially endangered species in one of the most
            threatened biodiversity hotspots of the World, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. This
            species is described here as <tp:taxon-name> Bombus bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. ,
            and included in a revised key for the identification of the bumblebee species known to
            occur in Brazil . Phylogenetic analyses based on two mt DNA markers suggest this new
            species to be sister to <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> , from which
            its workers and queens can be easily distinguished by the lack of a yellow hair-band on
            the first metasomal tergum. The results presented here are consistent with the
            hypothesis that <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. may have
            originated from an ancestral population isolated in an evergreen-forest refuge (the
            so-called Bahia refuge) during cold, dry periods of the Pleistocene. This refuge is also
            known as an important area of endemism for several animal taxa, including other bees.
            Secondary contact between <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> and
               <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> may be presently prevented by a
            strip of semi-deciduous forest in a climate zone characterized by relatively long dry
            seasons. Considering the relatively limited range of this new species and the current
            anthropic pressure on its environment, attention should be given to its conservation
            status. </p>

         <title> Introduction </title>
         <p> Despite the fact that, taxonomically, bees are among the best known insects in the
            world (for example [ ]), there are taxonomic problems to be solved in the group,
            including sex association in dimorphic species and distinction of cryptic species, even
            in relatively well-known taxa. In these cases, molecular data, including the so called
            DNA barcode, alone or integrated to other types of characters, have proven to be much
            useful (for example [ , ]). </p>
         <p> The bumblebees (genus <tp:taxon-name> Bombus Latreille, 1802 </tp:taxon-name> )
            comprise approximately 250 species widely distributed in the world, but occurring mainly
            in the cool subtropical and temperate areas of the Nearctic and, especially, Palearctic
            regions [ ]. Defining species limits in <tp:taxon-name> Bombus </tp:taxon-name> is
            frequently difficult, because of the lack of useful structural characters and the great
            variability in hair-color patterns. This has led to an array of recent studies employing
            DNA markers to elucidate bumblebee-species boundaries (for example [ – ]). Molecular
            tools have also been used in the genus to investigate intraspecific genetic structure,
            phylogeography and phylogenetic relationships (for example [ – ]). </p>
         <p> In South America, most of the species of <tp:taxon-name> Bombus </tp:taxon-name> are
            distributed along the Andes and in temperate regions, with only a few species recorded
            in the warm lowlands—the later, actually, the only bumblebees to occur in such
            environments in the world [ ]. Only six species of the genus are generally referred to
            occur in Brazil [ ], all belonging to the same subgenus— <tp:taxon-name> Fervidobombus
               Skorikov, 1922 </tp:taxon-name> or <tp:taxon-name> Thoracobombus Dalla Torre, 1880
            </tp:taxon-name> , depending on which classification one adopts (for example [ , ] or [
            ]). Five of these species ( <tp:taxon-name> B . bellicosus Smith, 1879 </tp:taxon-name>
            ; <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis Lepeletier, 1836 </tp:taxon-name> ; <tp:taxon-name> B
               . brevivillus Franklin, 1913 </tp:taxon-name> ; <tp:taxon-name> B . pauloensis
               Friese, 1913 </tp:taxon-name> ; and B . <tp:taxon-name> transversalis (Olivier,
               1789)) </tp:taxon-name> seem to be very closely related, while the sixth one,
               <tp:taxon-name> B . morio (Swederus, 1787) </tp:taxon-name> belongs to a distinctive
            clade in the same subgenus [ , ]. <tp:taxon-name> Bombus pauloensis </tp:taxon-name> has
            been widely treated as <tp:taxon-name> B . atratus Franklin, 1913 </tp:taxon-name> in
            the literature (for an explanation for the adoption of <tp:taxon-name> B . pauloensis
            </tp:taxon-name> as a valid name, see [ ]). The occurrence of a seventh species in
            western Brazil , <tp:taxon-name> B . pullatus Franklin, 1913 </tp:taxon-name> , was
            reported by Milliron [ ], but considered with suspicion by Abrahamovich &amp; Díaz [ ],
            and ignored by Moure &amp; Melo [ ], and needs confirmation. An eighth species,
               <tp:taxon-name> B . rubriventris Lepeletier, 1836 </tp:taxon-name> , was recorded
            with doubts by Milliron [ ] as possibly occurring in the state of Goiás . According to
            him, this species, known only from its female holotype , would be very rare or extinct.
            One cannot rule out the possibility that the assignment of <tp:taxon-name> B .
               rubriventris </tp:taxon-name> to Brazil resulted from mere labeling mistake or from
            wrong interpretation of the type locality (see [ ] for details). </p>
         <p> In their thorough revision of the Brazilian bumblebees, Moure &amp; Sakagami [ ]) noted
            that <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis Lepeletier, 1836 </tp:taxon-name> was the only
            species to be more common on mountaintops (mainly in the ranges along the southern and
            eastern Brazilian coasts) than in lowlands, and that it was the only one recorded in
            elevations above 1,800 m . Later, Silveira &amp; Cure [ ] noted that <tp:taxon-name> B .
               brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> is absent in the lowlands surrounding the mountain
            ranges where it is relatively common further inland in southeastern Brazil . The
            occurrence of these isolated mountaintop populations of <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis
            </tp:taxon-name> raised the suspicion that they might in fact belong to a species
            different from the one present in the lowlands along the coast and in the Paraná River
            valley. Here, this hypothesis is tested, mainly by means of phylogenetic and
            population-genetic analyses of two mt DNA genes. Since the question of how to delimit
            species boundaries is still in debate (see, for instance, the revision by Wiley &amp;
            Lieberman [ ]), different character sources (molecular and morphological) and analytical
            methods (tree and non-tree based) were complementarily employed to decide whether or not
            a set of populations should be considered as a new taxon. </p>

         <p>Morphological and Molecular Procedures</p>
         <p> The description of the new species presented below was based on six specimens—three
            workers and a queen from the municipality of Ilhéus, in the Brazilian state of Bahia ,
            and two workers collected in the municipality of Conceição da Barra, state of Espírito
            Santo . These specimens are deposited at the Taxonomic Collections of the ‘Universidade
            Federal de Minas Gerais’— UFMG—and in the ‘Padre Jesus Santiago Moure’ entomological
            collection, of the ‘Universidade Federal do Paraná’—DZUP—, as detailed in the section
            “Taxonomic treatment”, below. Two collecting expeditions were conducted in southern
            Bahia and northern Espírito Santo states (coordinates of sampling sites are, in Bahia :
            Eunápolis— 16°25'8"S , 39°34'55"W , 162m ; Itamaraju— 16°58'39"S , 39°33'16"W , 81m ;
            Porto Seguro— 16°27'3"S , 39°17'16"W , 114m ; and, in Espírito Santo : Conceição da
            Barra— 18°20'54"S , 39°51'06"W , 47m ; São Mateus— 18°45'13"S , 39°51'39"W , 39 m ;
            Sooretama— 19°03'01"S , 40°08'02"W , 94m ), under the collecting permit number 23784
            (granted by “Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade” to JESJ), in an
            attempt to increase molecular sample size and geographic representation. No additional
            specimens were found, however, during these expeditions. </p>
         <p> The specimens were examined under a dissection microscope (Leica M125) and compared to
            the descriptions in Moure &amp; Sakagami [ ]. Comparisons were also made with
            photographs of the lectotype of <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis Lepeletier, 1836
            </tp:taxon-name> , reproduced here in Fig 1A and 1B . Direct observation of this type
            was not done because, after examining hundreds of specimens of <tp:taxon-name> B .
               brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> from all its geographic range, an easily-observable
            diagnostic character was found to distinguish the two concerned species, which could be
            readily checked in the photographs obtained from the type. Morphological terminology
            employed here is mostly that of Moure &amp; Sakagami [ ]. Flagellomeres are designated
            as F1, F2, F3 etc. Accordingly, metasomal terga and sterna are designated as T1, T2, T3
            etc and S1, S2, S3 etc. The apical width of the malar area is the shortest width of the
            malar area, measured along the mandible base. </p>
         <p> Two mitochondrial markers, Cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and Cytochrome B (CytB) were
            employed in addition to the morphological characters. DNA was extracted from one of the
            hind legs of each of 168 <tp:taxon-name> Bombus </tp:taxon-name> specimens, 142 of them
            belonging to <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> , three to the species
            described as new below, and the rest belonging to the other species of the genus known
            to occur in Brazil (S1 Table). This was done through the phenol–chloroform method [ ].
            The extracted DNA was re-suspended in 40μL of TE buffer. The 5’region of the COI gene
            was amplified using the primers LepF1 and LepR1 [ ], mtd_6 and mtd_9 [ ], and that of
            the CytB was amplified using the primers mtd_26 [ ] and CytB_R1, 5'TTCAATTATTTGACTT
            CCTAATCAAG3' (designed for this analysis). Amplification of both genes was done in a
            30μL polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mix, including 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 2
            mM MgCl 2 , in 1x PCR buffer, 0.5 μM of each primer, 2.5 mMdNTPs and about 20 ng of
            genomic DNA. Amplification was carried out in a thermocycler using a program consisting
            of 5 min of denaturation at 94°C, followed by 35 30-second cycles at 94°C, 40 s at
            48–51°C, 1 min at 72°C, and a final extension for 10 min at 72°C. PCR products were
            visualized in a 0.8% agarose gel. All PCRs that generated a single product were purified
            using polyethylene glycol 20% (PEG) precipitation (modified of Sambrook &amp; Russel [
            ]—S2 Table). This purified PCR product was sequenced in both directions using a MegaBACE
            1000 sequencer (GE Healthcare) with the same amplification primers following the
            manufacturer's recommendations. The raw sequences were obtained using the software Phred
            v. 0.20425 [ ]. The final sequences were assembled with the software Phrap v. 0.990319
            (http//www.phrap.org). Consed 19.0 [ ] was used to view and edit the high quality
            consensus sequences. Alignments of the consensus sequences for all individuals were
            generated using MUSCLE [ ] implemented in the program MEGA 5.01 [ ]. </p>
         <p>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0125847.g001</p>
         <p> Molecular extraction and sequencing were done in the Biodiversity and Molecular
            Evolution Lab (LBEM), atthe Universidade FederaldeMinas Gerais , Belo Horizonte, Brazil
            . Inaddition to the 306 sequences generated here (168 COI, and 138 CytB sequences) for
            five species, 49 COI sequences available in the GenBank were employed for 16 species
            belonging to the subgenus <tp:taxon-name> Thoracobombus </tp:taxon-name> (sensu Williams
            et al. [ ]) ( Table 1 ). Additionally, sequences from three others specimens of
               <tp:taxon-name> B . bellicosus </tp:taxon-name> , stored in the Barcode of Life
            Database, and kindly made available by Dr. P. Tubaro, from the Museo Argentino de
            Ciencias Naturales, were also employed ( Table 1 ). </p>

         <p> doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0125847.t001 </p>
         <p> The computer programs Arlequin version 3.5.1.2 [ ], DnaSP version 5.10.01 [ ] and MEGA
            5.01 were used to estimate the following intra and interpopulational parameters: 1)
            haplotype diversity (H); 2) average number of nucleotide differences (k); 3) mean number
            of pairwise differences (π); 4) number of polymorphic sites (S); and 5) Tajima’ s Dand
            Fu’ s FS test of selective neutrality. DnaSP was also used to verify non-synonymous and
            synonymous substitutions. Haplotype networks constructed using the median-joining
            algorithm (MJ) [ ], available in the NETWORK 4.5 software, were used for inferences
            about phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes and their possible geographical
            correlation. Population analyses were performed separately for <tp:taxon-name> B .
               brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> ( 124 specimens ) and <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis
            </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. ( 3 specimens ) using a CytB and COI concatenated matrix ( 127
            specimens ). </p>
         <p> Average intra and interspecific genetic distances were obtained with Mega 5.01, using
            the parameters of the Kimura 2 model—K2P [ ]. Two analyses were performed with different
            data sets, one using only the COI gene and the other employing a concatenated data set
            of the COI and CytB genes. This was done because: 1) There were more COI than CytB
            sequences available in GenBank and BOLD for species of <tp:taxon-name> Thoracobombus
            </tp:taxon-name> (sensu Williams et al.[ ]); and 2) There were no CytB sequences
            available for many of the specimens from which DNA was extracted for this work. </p>
         <p>Since primers used here were not the same as those employed for obtaining the sequences
            in GenBank and BOLD, only 402 bp were present in all sequences used in the COI-only
            analyses. Intraspecific distances were estimated only for species represented by three
            or more specimens, with at least two different haplotypes.</p>
         <p> Phylogenetic analyses were performed using a concatenated matrix with CytB and COIgene
            data, including a total of 138 specimens , with <tp:taxon-name> B . morio
            </tp:taxon-name> as the outgroup. The best fit substitution model estimated with
            Modeltest 3.7 [ ] for this analysis was the GTR+G model. </p>
         <p> Phylogenies were generated through Bayesian Inference (BI) in MrBayes 3.1 [ ], and
            through Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithms using the program
            PAUP * 4.0b10 [ ]. Inferencesof trees with MP and ML methods were performed using
            heuristic search, with the following parameters: stepwise addition (random) starting
            from a single initial tree and branch swapping (tree bisection and reconnection—TBR). MP
            analysis was set to retain up to 1000 most parsimonious trees. The bootstrap method was
            used as a measure of branch support for the recovered phylogenies, using a total of
            10,000 and 100 replications, respectively, for MP and ML. Phylogenetic analyses using BI
            used two sets of Markov chains, each containing three hot chains and one cold, with 20
            million generations with a 25% burn-in, to seek for convergence to the same subset of
            best trees. </p>

         <p> Concatenated population analyses </p>
         <p> The phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes and their geographical correlation,
            using the concatenated CytB (683 bp) and COI (471 bp) sequences (totaling 1154 bp),
            showed that populations from almost all the geographic range of <tp:taxon-name> B .
               brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> share haplotypes, as shown by the haplotype network,
            which suggests lack of population structure ( Fig 2 ). In contradiction to the initial
            hypothesis, thus, this result suggests that populations of <tp:taxon-name> B .
               brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> isolated in mountain tops away from the coast belong in
            the same species as those living in coastal forests from the state of Rio de Janeiro
            southward to the state of Santa Catarina and westward to Paraguay in the Paraná-river
            valley. </p>
         <p> On the other hand, these results indicate that the three specimens collected in the
            coastal forest of southern Bahia state (municipality of Ilhéus, all with the same
            haplotype) diverged from <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> by 38
            mutation steps ( Fig 2 ), suggesting that this population belongs to a different species
            (described below as <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. ) </p>
         <p> The population analysis of <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> included a
            total of 124 specimens , from 30 localities ( Fig 3 ). It resulted in 27 haplotypes, 17
            polymorphic sites (11 synonymous and six nonsynonymous mutations), 10 of which were
            parsimoniously informative and seven were autapomorphies (singleton sites). The total
            haplotype diversity (Hd), nucleotide diversity (π), and average number of nucleotide
            differences (K) were 0.886 , 0.003 and 3.057, respectively. The statistics for the
            neutrality tests were D = -0.083 (p = 0.5) for Tajima’ s, and FS = -12.28 (p = 0.001)
            for Fu’ s. Although the Tajima’ s Dwas not statistically significant, the significant
            value of Fu’ s FS, associated with the large number of unique haplotypes and the
            star-shaped haplotype network, suggests recent population expansion. </p>
         <p> The genetic distance between <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. and
               <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> was 3.7 ± 0.6%, while the average
            intraspecific distance within <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> was 0.26
            ± 0.09%. The population parameters above were not calculated for <tp:taxon-name> B .
               bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. , since all three specimens had the same haplotype.

            </tp:taxon-name> were obtained for seven other species pairs (S3 Table). Moreover, while
            the largest distance between any two specimens of <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis
            </tp:taxon-name> was of 1 ± 0.5%, the smallest distance between a specimen of

         <p> The intraspecific distances among the <tp:taxon-name> Thoracobombus </tp:taxon-name>
            species analyzed here, estimated with the COI sequences, were all equal or smaller than
            0.5% ( Table 2 ). One exception was the mean intraspecific distance for <tp:taxon-name>
               B . brevivillus </tp:taxon-name> , which was very high when all specimens originally
            attributed to this species where considered together ( Table 2 ). Moreover, the average
            distance between the two “ <tp:taxon-name> B . brevivillus </tp:taxon-name> ” clades
            obtained in the phylogenetic results described below is 3.92 ± 0.93%. This suggests that
            the samples considered here as belonging to <tp:taxon-name> B . brevivillus
            </tp:taxon-name> include specimens of two distinct species ( <tp:taxon-name> B .
               brevivillus </tp:taxon-name> (1) and (2) in S3 Table). This finding is being examined
            in detail and results will be published elsewhere. </p>

         <p> Of the 1157 bp employed in the phylogenetic analyses (686 bp for CytB and 471 for COI),
            916 were constant, three were gaps; eight variable characters were
            parsimony-uninformative, and 233 were parsimony-informative. Those three gaps are due to
            one CytB codon appearing exclusively in <tp:taxon-name> B . morio </tp:taxon-name>
            (included as the outgroup) and were the cause for the difference in pair-base numbers
            between the data employed in the phylogenetic and the population analyses. </p>
         <p> The phylogenetic analyses yielded the same single topology for Parsimony, Maximum
            Likelihood and Bayesian analysis ( Fig 4 ). This tree was yielded after 1,102,282
            rearrangements in the MP analyses and was 302-steps long. The average standard deviation
            of split frequencies after 20 million generations in the Bayesian analysis was of
            0.002869, indicating convergence to a single subset of trees. </p>
         <p> The phylogenetic analyses are congruent with the population analyses in suggesting that
            populations of <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> isolated on the top of
            mountain ranges in southeastern Brazil belong to the same species as those in the
            Atlantic coast and in the lowlands of the Paraná-river valley (S1 Fig). They also show
            that specimens originally attributed to <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis

         <p> Examination of the external morphology of specimens attributed by the molecular
            analyses to <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> and to <tp:taxon-name> B .
               bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. revealed a character also allowing for their
            distinction: The pilosity of T1, which is entirely yellow in <tp:taxon-name> B .
               brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> and mostly black in <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis
            </tp:taxon-name> (see key below). Furthermore, this character led to the recognition
            that two additional specimens from Conceição da Barra (northern Espírito Santo state )
            also belong in <tp:taxon-name> B . Bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp.n. (these latter
            specimens were too old and DNA extraction from them was not attempted). Considering the
            molecular and morphological evidence, the specimens from southern Bahia attributed to
               <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> in our samples are considered here
            to be a species distinct from that containing the remaining populations of
               <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> . </p>
         <p> Two pieces of evidence indicate that the name <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis
            </tp:taxon-name> should be applied to the species occurring along the coast of Rio de
            Janeiro and southwards: a) the holotype of <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis
            </tp:taxon-name> has its first metasomal tergum covered with yellow pilosity ( Fig 1B ),
            as opposed to black, as in specimens from southern Bahia ( Fig 1C and 1D ); and b) the
            fact that this type specimen was probably collected in the vicinities of the city of Rio
            de Janeiro [ ]. </p>
         <p> Moreover, two synonyms are recognized for <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis
            </tp:taxon-name> : <tp:taxon-name> B . venustus Smith, 1861 </tp:taxon-name> and
               <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis var. palliventris Friese, 1931 </tp:taxon-name> [ ,
            ], the former described from Teresópolis (on the top of the Serra do Mar mountain range,
            in the state of Rio de Janeiro— Fig 3 ) and the latter from Paraguay . The fact that
            populations sampled in Paraguay and on the mountaintops in southeastern Brazil showed to
            be conspecific with specimens from the southern Atlantic coast in the phylogenetic and
            population-genetic analyses, indicate that those names should continue to be considered
            as synonyms of <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> . Taking all above in
            account, the populations occurring to the north of the Doce river, in the coastal
            forests of northern Espírito Santo and southern Bahia , are described below as a new
            species. </p>

               Brazilian state of Bahia , where the holotype and some of the paratypes were
               collected, and to its habitat, the Bahia Forest (see explanation below, under

         <p>Variation discontinuity, Phylogeny and Species Status</p>
         <p> The genetic distance between <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. and
               <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> was relatively small, and this may
            raise the suspicion that they might in fact be a single species. However, comparable
            small divergences have been commonly estimated for several species-pairs believed to
            have diverged recently, in other bee taxa. For example, divergences found for
            COI-sequences by Dick et al. [ ] and Nemésio et al. [ ] between species pairs of
            orchid-bee (Euglossina) in South America were all below 2%, while Gibbs [ ] found only a
            3.06% average COI-sequence divergence among five species of <tp:taxon-name> Lasioglossum
            </tp:taxon-name> previously misinterpreted as a single species (with the lowest recorded
            value of 1.7% ) . In <tp:taxon-name> Bombus </tp:taxon-name> , such small genetic
            distances were found, also, among cryptic species in northern Europe ([ , ], see also
            Table 5 in [ ]). Moreover, although the average genetic distance between <tp:taxon-name>
               B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name>
            sp. n. was the smallest recorded between pairs of Brazilian species of <tp:taxon-name>
               Bombus </tp:taxon-name> in this study, it was higher, for example, than those
            obtained for seven other pairs of undisputed species in Asia, Europe, and South America
            (S3 Table). The fact that the smallest distance between a specimen of <tp:taxon-name> B
               . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> and one of <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis
            </tp:taxon-name> is 2.5 times larger than the largest distance between any two specimens
            of <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> is an additional support for a
            genetic gap between <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> B
               . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> . </p>
         <p> Traditionally, discontinuity in variation among populations has been considered, both
            in morphological and molecular-based studies, as evidence that independently-evolving
            lineages are involved (for example [ ]). In the barcoding context, average
            intra-population divergences much smaller than the inter-population divergences (the so
            called barcode gap—[ ]) is considered evidence that they are cohesive sets of
            populations, isolated from each other. Much has been discussed in the literature about
            the reality and convenient thresholds of such a gap (for example [ ]). However, there is
            some agreement that one is safe in recognizing different species when the barcode gap
            between them reaches the order of one magnitude, as in the case of <tp:taxon-name> B .
               brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp.
            n. Aproblem here is that large intra-specific divergence could not be expected for
               <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. , considering that it is
            represented by a small sample from a single site. However, the situation could be looked
            at from the other way around: <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> from
            sites more than 1500 km apart along the latitudinal gradient or from isolated
            populations in areas differing more than 1500 m in elevation did not show divergences as
            large as that found between populations of <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis
            </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. and those of <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name>
            about 240 Km apart in lowland evergreen forests. </p>
         <p> The fact that <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> B .
               bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. are reciprocally monophyletic also supports their
            recognition as separate species (for example [ ]), as it suggests that each of them is a
            mutually-independent evolutionary lineage. It could be argued that the phylogenetic
            hypothesis produced here, being based on two linked genes (maternally-inherited mtDNA),
            may merely indicate a phylogeny for those genes, which may be different from the correct
            phylogeny of the species involved (for example [ ]). Nevertheless, as pointed out by
            Williams et al. [ ], this problem has not been detected for the use of COI in bumblebees
            and, moreover, mt DNA may actually be more suitable for species delimitation than other
            molecular and morphological data [ ]. </p>

         <title> Biogeographic considerations </title>
         <p> Before the arrival of the Portuguese settlers, the presumed geographic range of
               <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. was covered by an especially
            luxurious evergreen forest (from now on, the Bahia forest), coinciding with an important
            area of endemism for many plant and animal taxa, including insects [ ], and including
            several recently-described endemic species of orchid bees (
               <tp:taxon-name>Apidae</tp:taxon-name> : Euglossina) (for example [ – ]). Intra- and
            interspecific disjunctions of populations or sister-species involving this area and
            other areas in the Amazonian Forest or to the south in the Atlantic Forest also have
            been recorded for several taxa (for example [ – ]). </p>
         <p> Acloser look to the distributions of <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name>
            and <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. shows a 240-km gap between the
            northernmost known record of the species in the coastal lowlands of Rio de Janeiro state
            (in the municipality of São Francisco de Itabapoana, see Fig 3 and S 1 Table), and its
            southernmost record in the lowlands of Espírito Santo state (municipality of Linhares; [
            ]— see comments on this population below) ( Fig 3 ). <tp:taxon-name> Bombus brasiliensis
            </tp:taxon-name> does occur in southeastern Brazil , in latitudes between those of
            Linhares and São Francisco de Itabapoana [ , , ], but all these records (and additional
            localities represented in the UFMG collection) refer to cloud forests (or their
            immediate vicinities) on the top of mountain chains, further inland. These mountaintop
            records represent populations which are isolated from those near the coast ( Fig 3 ) by
            semi-deciduous forests in areas under climates with relatively long dry seasons (4–6
            months)—the same kind of environment found in the gap between the humid northern area
            occupied by <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. and the humid southern
            area occupied by <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> (compare, for
            example, the map in Fig 3 with that of the Atlantic Forest vegetation types presented by
            Carnaval et al. [ ] in their supplementary material’ Figure S1 ). </p>
         <p> Close relationship between elements of the Bahia forest and the Amazonian Forest biotas
            has been pointed out for organisms such as birds (for example [ ]) and also for orchid
            bees, with several pairs of presumed sister species of the latter occurring disjunctly
            in the two phytogeographic domains (for example [ , ]). This may suggest that
               <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. could be sister to the only
            species in the genus restricted to Amazonia, <tp:taxon-name> B . transversalis
            </tp:taxon-name> [ ]. However, this hypothesis is not supported by any of the results
            obtained here. </p>
         <p> The presumed range of <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. also falls
            within a forest refuge that existed in the Atlantic Forest domain during cold, dry
            periods of the Pleistocene, the so-called Bahia refuge, which was predicted by climatic
            models and validated by paleopalynological data (for example [ , , ]). In the Bahia
            refuge, limited in the south by the Doce river, in Espírito Santo , and extending
            northward into southern Bahia , evergreen forests persisted even in the driest periods
            of the Pleistocene. Carnaval et al. [ ] predicted that surveys in this area would still
            reveal undescribed species and cryptic lineages. If Hines [ ] is right in her estimate
            that the closest common ancestor of <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> ,
               <tp:taxon-name> B . transversalis </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> B . pauloensis
            </tp:taxon-name> existed at about 2 Mya, then the most recent common ancestor of
               <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis
            </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. lived in the Pleistocene, and this would be consistent with the
            hypothesis that the isolation of part of its populations in the Bahia refuge during that
            period could be the vicariance event responsible for its genetic divergence. The close
            association of <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> B .
               bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. with evergreen forests in southeastern Brazil
            suggests that interbreeding of their populations may have been prevented by their
            inability to settle in lowland semi-deciduous forests, which occur under climates with
            relatively long dry seasons and that reaches the coast between southern Espírito Santo
            and northern Rio de Janeiro states. It should be noted, however, that this hypothesis is
            weakened by the occurrence of <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> in areas
            dominated by climates with relatively long dry seasons and covered with semideciduous
            forests along the Paraná River valley, westward into Paraguay and central Brazil ( Fig 3
            ). Acloser look at the habitats used by this species in that region is necessary for a
            better understanding of this question. </p>
         <p> Morphological distinction and geographic range </p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name> Bombus </tp:taxon-name> is a relatively monotonous genus, as far as
            morphological characters are concerned (for example [ ]), and this makes them frequently
            difficult to distinguish, especially among closely-related species (for example [ – , ].
            Thus, it is not surprising that not a single exclusive autoapomorphy of <tp:taxon-name>
               B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. could be found, and that the only morphological
            character distinguishing it from its presumed sister species, the black-haired T1, is a
            plesiomorphic trait or, at most, a homoplastic apomorphy, also found in all other
            Brazilian species but <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> (for example [
            ]). </p>
         <p> Moure &amp; Sakagami [ ] noticed that specimens identified by them as <tp:taxon-name> B
               . brasiliensis </tp:taxon-name> from Linhares, by the northern margin of the Doce
            river, in Espírito Santo state (shown by a grey triangle with a central black dot in Fig
            3 ) had their first metasomal tergum completely covered by black pilosity. They
            interpreted this population as a melanic variety of <tp:taxon-name> B . brasiliensis
            </tp:taxon-name> . These specimens quite probably belong to <tp:taxon-name> B .
               bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. and may represent the southernmost population of
            the species, since the Doce river is the southern limit for the evergreen forests of the
            Bahia refuge and the Bahia forest (although some authors, as Silva &amp; Casteleti [ ]
            and Ribeiro et al. [ ] consider the Bahia forest to extend further south in Espírito
            Santo ). </p>

         <title> Conservation Status </title>
         <p> Local or regional decline or extirpation of bumblebee populations has been reported in
            the northern hemisphere (for example [ , – ]) and in Brazil [ ]. It seems that the small
            available sample of <tp:taxon-name> B . bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. reflects a low
            abundance in nature and not a small sampling effort in its habitat. The bee fauna of
            northern Espírito Santo was intensively sampled by C. Elias, a collector for the DZOL
            collection in Curitiba in the 1960’s and early 1970’s, and the only specimens of the
            species collected among thousands of bee specimens, apparently are those few listed in
            the “Taxonomic treatment”. Moreover, two expeditions were set to southern Bahia and
            northern Espírito Santo to search for the species, during the development of this
            project (January and June/July, 2014), but resulted unsuccessful. With this in mind, two
            facts should be considered concerning the conservation of this new species: 1) its
            presumed geographic range is the smallest among all Brazilian <tp:taxon-name> Bombus
            </tp:taxon-name> species; and 2) its natural habitat is under heavy anthropic impact—the
            rain forest that originally covered about 86% of the region, now covers only between 12%
            and 17% of it [ , ]—and continues to be fragmented. Moreover, bees in general and
            bumblebees specifically may be more susceptible to fragmentation than other organisms,
            due to issues related to effective population size, social behavior, nesting, sex
            determination mechanisms etc. (see discussions in [ , ]). Thus, <tp:taxon-name> B .
               bahiensis </tp:taxon-name> sp. n. may actually be an endangered species and efforts
            should be made to map the remaining populations of the species and their abundances,
            better defining its current geographic range and conservation status. </p>
