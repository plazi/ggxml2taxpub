         <p> Despite the importance of species discovery, the processes including collecting,
            recognizing, and describing new species are poorly understood. Data are presented for fl
            owering plants, measuring quantitatively the lag between the date a specimen of a new
            species was collected for the fi rst time and when it was subsequently described and
            published. The data from our sample of new species published between 1970 and 2010 show
            that only 16% were described within fi ve years of being collected for the fi rst time.
            The description of the remaining 84% involved much older specimens, with nearly
            one-quarter of new species descriptions involving specimens&gt;50 y old. Extrapolation
            of these results suggest that, of the estimated 70,000 species still to be described,
            more than half already have been collected and are stored in herbaria. Effort, funding,
            and research focus should, therefore, be directed as much to examining extant herbarium
            material as collecting new material in the fi eld. </p>

         <p> A global ccurate biodiversity species recognition ( – ). In recent underpins years, our
            the lack knowledge of taxono of mic activity has led to increased political ( ) and
            scientific calls ( ) to invest in the science of taxonomy, which is fundamental for what
            we know about species-level diversity. The assumptions behind these demands are that
            increased resources would necessarily lead to increased taxonomic productivity and
            accuracy. Given finite resources, it is essential that scientifically sound criteria
            regarding where funds should most usefully be targeted are used to determine priorities
            for taxonomic research. It is therefore surprising that the processes of collecting,
            recognizing, and describing species are poorly understood and only rarely discussed ( –
            ) and that there is little research focused on the processes that result in the
            recognition of new species. Many groups of organisms are so poorly known that measuring
            any aspect of the discovery process suffers from lack of data. In terms of completing
            the species-level “inventory of life,” the flowering plants are viewed as an attainable
            priority research target because they are already relatively well known and the final
            inventory is estimated to be only 10–20% from completion ( ). Furthermore, plants are
            pivotal organisms for monitoring and measuring global biodiversity because they comprise
            a species-rich component of almost all habitats on earth ( ). An enhanced scientific
            understanding of the discovery process for flowering plants could help define specific
            priorities for funding agencies and facilitate the meeting of global biodiversity
            targets. Here, we focus on the temporal dynamics of the lag between the collection of
            flowering plant specimens and their subsequent recognition and description as new
            species ( ). For a representative dataset, the discovery time ( I ) between the date of
            the earliest specimen collected ( C ) and date the description was published ( D ) was
            calculated for each species ( Fig. 1 ). </p>

         <p> Data. Data were assembled for 3,219 species described during the period 1970–2010 and
            associated with specimens collected between 1770–2007 ( SI Text ). We chose this period
            because it most accurately reflects the contemporary situation and also avoids the
            complicated taxonomic history and synonymy associated with older species descriptions.
            The data were gathered from two sources that represent the full range of taxonomic
            activity and geography: new species (sp. nov.) from six monographic treatments ( n = 449
            species) and the journal Kew Bulletin ( n = 2,770 species). We selected monographic
            treatments of taxa with a range of geographical distribution patterns to best capture
            global differences in species occurrence and the history of taxonomic activity, i.e.,
            the pan-tropical <tp:taxon-name>Chrysobalanaceae</tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>
               Aframomum </tp:taxon-name> from Africa, <tp:taxon-name> Inga </tp:taxon-name> from
            tropical America, <tp:taxon-name> Strobilanthes </tp:taxon-name> from South and South
            East Asia , <tp:taxon-name> Agalmyla </tp:taxon-name> from Malesia , and <tp:taxon-name>
               Hypericum </tp:taxon-name> distributed in temperate and subtropical regions, also
            extending into tropical montane habitats (Dataset S1). Five of the monographs included
            fieldwork and examination of large quantities of recently collected specimens. For
            example, after the first part of the <tp:taxon-name>Chrysobalanaceae</tp:taxon-name>
            monograph was published in 1972, 11,500 additional herbarium collections were made and
            then examined by the author. For <tp:taxon-name>Aframomum</tp:taxon-name> , 547 of 3,184
            specimens examined were collected after 1990. For <tp:taxon-name> Strobilanthes
            </tp:taxon-name> , targeted field work was carried out in Sri Lanka , India , Bhutan ,
            Java, and the Philippines over a 15-y period. We reasoned that new species described in
            Kew Bulletin provide a representative sample of all new species descriptions included in
            taxonomic revisions, small monographs, and novelties as a result of ongoing collecting
            activities. Any overlapping records from parts of monographs published in Kew Bulletin
            were identified and counted once only under monographs. The discovery time ( I ) between
            the date of the earliest specimen collected ( C ) and date the description was published
            ( D ) was calculated for each species. </p>
         <p> Statistical Analysis. The process of discovery was investigated by using survival
            analysis,which examines and models the time it takes for events to occur ( , ). Survival
            analysis is often applied to survival until death, but it can be applied to a wide range
            of situations in which individuals change state (for </p>
         <p> example, failure time of mechanical components). Because the data represent a change of
            state over time (from being a collected specimen in a herbarium to being a named
            species), the interval I can be analyzed by using these techniques. Survival curves (the
            fraction of specimens remaining to be named over time) and their variances were
            calculated by using the Kaplan– Meier estimator. Survival data can be modeled by using
            hazard functions, where the hazard h at time t is the instantaneous risk of state-change
            (in this case, description of a collected specimen), conditional on being collected by
            undescribed at that time: </p>
         <p> Pr ½ð t ≤ I &lt;t þ Δ t Þj I&gt; t h ð t Þ ¼ lim: Δ t → 0 Δ t </p>
         <p>Survival data can be modeled by using the log of the hazard function as the response
            variable and a linear function of log time as the predictor, which leads to the Weibull
            distribution of survival times:</p>
         <p> log h ð t Þ ¼ v þ ρ log ð t Þ: </p>
         <p> Quantile plots indicate that I for the entire dataset and the collections separately
            match Weibull distributions closely, validating the use of survival analyses for these
            data ( Fig. S1 ). </p>
         <p> A common method to analyze the effect of covariates on the hazard function is through
            Cox proportional hazards models, where the baseline hazard function, log h 0 ( t ), is
            modified by covariates: </p>
         <p> log hi ð t Þ ¼ log h 0 ð t Þ þ β 1 xi 1 þ β 2 xi 2 þ ⋯ þ βkxik : </p>
         <p> Here, β are coefficients, i is a subscript for observation, and x is a covariate. Cox
            models are therefore a form of General Linear Model. The effect of C and D on the hazard
            function and predictions of future (I) were estimated by using Cox models. </p>
