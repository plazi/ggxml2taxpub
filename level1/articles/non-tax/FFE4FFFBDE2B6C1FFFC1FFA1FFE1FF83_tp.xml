out of four methods for the 
<tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name>
despite the problem of missing sequence data. The recovered sequences contain informative phylogenetic signal consistent with predictions based on genetic and morphological data for mastodon (
10
, 
11
) and on morphological data for 
<tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name>
(
12
, 
13
) These results support the endogenous origin of the preserved collagen molecules and confirm the prediction based on morphology that, ifbiomolecules could be retrieved from a nonavian dinosaur, they would share a higher degree of similarity with birds than with other extant vertebrates. Our findings suggest that molecular data from long-extinct organisms may have the potential for resolving relationships at critical areas of the vertebrate evolutionary tree that have, so far, been intractable. The findings presented here also bolster the use ofmorphology in phylogenetics because our results are consistent with studies on the evolutionary relationships of fossil forms that rely on morphology (

' Protein sequences from bone-derived collagen P as old as 68 million years have been detected by using mass spectrometry (
1
, 
2
). A BLAST search of the resulting peptide sequences found the highest similarities between the collagen peptides obtained from extracts of 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus rex</tp:taxon-name>
fossil bone and those ofbirds (
<tp:taxon-name>Gallus gallus</tp:taxon-name>
) and between mastodon (
<tp:taxon-name>Mammut americanum</tp:taxon-name>
) and other mam­ mals, including elephant (
<tp:taxon-name>Loxodonta africana</tp:taxon-name>
). We performed phylogenetic analyses to infer the evolutionary relationships of the 
<tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name>
[Museum of the Rockies (
<tp:material-citation>MOR) 1125</tp:material-citation>
] and mastodon (MOR 605). The results extend our knowledge of trait evo­ lution within nonavian dinosaurs into the macro­ molecular level of biological organization. We used 21 extant organisms in the analyses. Collagen a 1(I) and a2(I) protein sequences from 19 extant organisms (3) were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and ENSEMBL databases. Collagen a1(I) and a2(I) peptide sequences from a metacarpal of Alligator mississippiensis were obtained by mi­ crocapillary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) with an ion trap mass spectrometer using the Sequest algorithm (
1
, 
2
) and the Paragon algorithm (
4
). Ostrich collagen se­ quences were determined elsewhere (
1
, 
2
). Sequences from alligator (Crocodilia) and ostrich (Aves) rep­ resent 63% and 43% of the full-length collagen a1(I) protein available for other organisms, respec­ tively. The collagen a1(I) and a2(I) sequences for elephant (L. africana), tenrec (Echinops telfairi), and

with less support (approximate likelihood ratio test; aLRT = 0.855 for Elephantinae and 0.872 for Afrotheria). Maximum parsimony analysis also groups mastodon, elephant, and tenrec together (fig. S1, B to D). For the 
<tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name>
sample, we used five peptide sequences from collagen a1(I) and one from collagen a2(I) (
1
, 
2
, 
8
) for a total of 89 amino acids (

). The 
<tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name>
clusters within the Archosauria (posterior probability of 0.92), more closely related to birds (chicken and ostrich, 0.9) than alligator, although a lack of informative sites in the ostrich and 
<tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name>
leaves Dinosauria unresolved. The likelihood tree is identical to the Bayesian tree, except for higher support at these locations in the tree (aLRT = 0.969 for Archosauria and 0.907 for Dinosauria). Branch lengths (expected rates of change per site) indicate a relatively stable and uniform rate of evolution, lacking evidence for a deviation from a molecular clock. Maximum par­ simony analysis also groups the 
<tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name>
with the chicken and ostrich, although bootstrap support is low (fig. S1, B to D). Neighbor joining groups the 
<tp:taxon-name>T. rex</tp:taxon-name>
with the birds, but miscalculates the branching order and misplaces alligator, mastodon, and several extant organisms (fig. S1, B to D).

The slight disagreement between the distance results compared with the Bayesian, likelihood, and parsimony results (all three of which are concordant) are predictable given that distance methods perform poorly for taxa with large amounts of missing data (
9
). Nevertheless, there is congruence between three out of the four methods for the mastodon and four

Bayesian, likelihood, parsimony, and dis­ tance methods were used to generate evolu­ tionary trees (6). In the Bayesian analysis, the posterior distribution of trees reconstructed all extant groups in generally agreed-upon rela­ tionships (the posterior probability of clades ranged from 0.80 to 1.00), with the exception of green anole (A. carolinensis), which is in­ ferred here to lie at the base of amniotes in­ stead ofgrouping as the sister taxon to alligator and birds (archosaurs) (

). LC/MS/MS from tryptic digests produces fragmentary pro­ tein sequence data; however, we found unequivocal support (posterior probability of 1.00) uniting mastodon with elephant as members of Elephantinae, which together group with tenrec (E. telfairi) as members of the mam­ malian group Afrotheria (
7
). Maximum likeli­ hood produces the same groupings, although
