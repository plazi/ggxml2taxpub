Deuterostomes

are controversial and the nature of the original deuterostome remains idealized. Here we report millimetric fossils, 

<tp:taxon-name>Saccorhytus</tp:taxon-name>
coronarius

nov. gen., nov. sp., from an Orsten-like Lagerstätte from the earliest Cambrian period of South China, which stratigraphically are amongst the earliest of deuterostomes. The bag-like body bears a prominent mouth and associated folds, and behind them up to four conical openings on either side of the body as well as possible sensory structures. An anus may have been absent, and correspondingly the lateral openings probably served to expel water and waste material. This new form has similarities to both the vetulicolians



and vetulocystids



and collectively these findings suggest that a key step in deuterostome evolution was the development of lateral openings that subsequently were co-opted as pharyngeal gills 

–

. Depending on its exact phylogenetic position, the meiofaunal habit of 
<tp:taxon-name>

may help to explain the major gap between divergence times seen in the fossil record and estimates based on molecular clocks

</p>
         <p>
Insights into the early evolution of deuterostomes 

are critically dependent on the Cambrian fossil record, notably from Burgess Shaletype and Orsten-style Lagerstätten. By Cambrian Series 2–3 (around 510–520 million years ago (Ma)), this superphylum had diversified into echinoderms 

, hemichordates 

, tunicates 

and vertebrates 

, as well as the more problematic cambroernids 

, vetulicolians 

, 

, vetulocystids 

, 

and yunnanozoans 

. This degree of disparity, combined with apparently rapid divergences, renders the identification of the various stem groups problematic and also frustrates reconstruction of the ur-deuterostome. Here we describe a suite of phosphatized microfossils from the earliest Cambrian period of South China (Extended Data 
Fig. 1
). These fossils throw new light on what appears to be an early stage in deuterostome evolution and reiterate the importance of Örsten-style Lagerstätten 

– 

as a source of insights into the Cambrian metazoan radiations.

Forty-five phosphatized specimens are available (

, 

, Extended Data 

–6 and Supplementary Table 1). As with similar material from this horizon 
14
– 
16
and co-eval deposits 
17
, the phosphatic composition of the specimens is evidently the result of very early diagenesis. Extensive folding suggests that in life the integument was thin, flexible and only slightly sclerotized. The integument consists of two layers (Extended Data 

b, c, h, 3c, g, 5k, 6c, d), and frequently exhibits a fine-scale, densely spaced chevron-like folding on both external and internal surfaces (

b, Extended Data 

f–i, 3h, 4g and Supplementary Table 1). If original, this suggests that the integument was bi-layered.
</p>
            <p>
The body is hemi-ellipsoidal, with a maximum length of 1,300μm, width 800μm and height 900μm (Extended Data Fig. 7). Most material is crushed but several specimens (

g, h and Extended Data Figs 5g, h, 6a) confirm original bilateral symmetry. Otherwise, body orientations depend principally on identification of the mouth, and presumably the more dorsal and posterior location of the body cones and possibly sensory pores. Post-mortem deformation makes the precise dispositions of other structures more difficult to interpret. The most parsimonious conclusion, however, is that these features were also arranged bilaterally (

g, h and Extended Data Figs 4f, h 6a).
</p>
            <p>
The largest of the body openings (approximately 300–500 μm) is defined by a double circlet with prominent radial folds. The folds of the inner circlet are somewhat finer and this circlet also bears a series of oral protrusions, each consisting of an outer sheath and an inner peg-like structure (

a, d, e, g–i, 2a, b, d, e and Extended Data 

c, 3f, 4a, c, f, 5a, c, d, g, i). This double circlet is interpreted as the oral region, while the protrusions, notably the most anterior pair (Extended Data Figs 5g, i, 6f, g), may represent sensilla. The flexibility of the oral region is evident from both its lateral compression and dorsal arching (

a, d, e, i, 2d and Extended Data Figs 4a, e, 5a, c, d, g).
</p>
            <p>
Anterior to the oral region, the dorsal integument consists of up to four rugae with a nodular appearance (

a, d, 2a, b, d and Extended Data 

d, 4a, c, 5a, f). These may be separated by intervening integument or (presumably as a result of contraction) are closely adpressed with the nodular regions interlocked. Behind the rugae, the integument grades into a zone with longitudinal folds, but the posterior body is relatively smooth. Otherwise the most prominent structures are a series of body cones (

a, d, g, i, 2a, d, f, g and Extended Data 

a, b, d, h, 3a, c, d, g, 4b, d, f, h, 5a–c, e, g, k, 6). These vary in size (56–328 μm across), but all are formed of a series of ribs radiating from an unoccluded aperture. Up to eight body cones are visible, with the four body cones on the left and right sides extending in a more dorsal direction (

a). The first body cone is located immediately behind the oral region, and the body cone behind it is somewhat larger. The third body cone is the largest, and the most dorsal one is smaller. There are also two sets of small circular pores (30 μm across). One set is widely separated and runs parallel to the body cones (

a, g and Extended Data Figs 4f, h, 5g). The other set is more dorsal and consists of sub-linear arrays (

a, b, f, 2a, c, f, g and Extended Data 

a, d, e, j, 3a, d, e, 4f, h, 5b, h, j). Finally there are occasional conspicuous spines, with a wide base and elongate anterior taper (

c, 2h and Extended Data 

d, 5a, b, f, 6a). Strong folding makes the conclusion tentative, but no anus is evident (

a).
</p>
            <p>
The oral region could evidently distend, with its pleated arrangement accommodating changes in size. This, combined with dorsal arching, would allow ingestion of food particles and possibly somewhat larger prey 
18
. The size of mouth also suggests that water was swallowed, with the body cones being interpreted as exhalant structures. The dorsal extension of the body cones suggests that the corresponding oral cavity was also elongate. The more dorsal set of circular pores may represent the insertion points of setae. The other set adjacent to the body cones may have had a sensory function, although alternatively they could have released internal contents such as adhesive mucus or gametes.

The millimetric size of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
does not preclude a planktonic location, but its globular shape is consistent with a meiofaunal habit within what is now a phosphatic shelly limestone 
16
. Although we did not find exact counterparts amongst extant meiobenthic taxa, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
shows a suite of features consistent with an interstitial habitat 
18
. These include a thick but flexible cuticle, suitable for mechanical protection and wriggling between sediment grains, respectively (Extended Data 

c, d). The postulated setae, especially those towards the dorsal side, could perform a haptic role, including temporary attachment. Many meiofaunal taxa are progenetic and deciding whether 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
is best interpreted as a miniaturized adult or a larval stage has important implications for both potential life cycles and phylogenetic relationships. Evidence in favour of the former includes the observation that, despite a size range of 548–1,326 μm, the morphology is effectively invariant. More notable is that most extant larvae 
19
are ciliated and, although a few groups such as the bryozoans (cyphonautes) and loriciferans have thin cuticular coverings, they are unlike the relatively massive coat of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Irrespective of whether 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
is a progenetic relative of unknown macroscopic taxa, its closest relationships appear to lie with the vetulicolians and possibly vetulocystids. Forming part of a highly disparate suite of taxa, collectively they appear to represent early deuterostomes 
1
, 
20
, albeit ones not easily assigned to particular stem groups 
21
. Our phylogenetic analysis (

b, Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Information) confirms both the monophyly of the deuterostomes 
22
and component groups including vetulicolians plus banffiids and vetulocystids, but the position of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
remains less well constrained.
</p>
            <p>
With respect to vetulicolians, similarities with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
include the circum-oral radial structures and the body openings, interpreted as pharyngeal gills in the former group. In forms such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Didazoon
</tp:taxon-name>
12
the gills also have a convex exterior, although here the openings are directed posteriorly. Moreover, in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Didazoon
</tp:taxon-name>
the relative size of the openings in the posterior direction is similar to that seen in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
, notably with the third opening being conspicuously larger. In

23
the oral region shows variably developed pleating (Extended 
<tp:taxon-name>Data</tp:taxon-name>
Fig. 9), similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Similarities to the vetulocystids 
5
include body openings defined as truncated cones with well-developed radial ribs, albeit more numerous. The anterior body of vetulocystids is also strongly convoluted, and so reminiscent of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Very few characters unite the deuterostomes 
8
, 
22
, 
24
, and only the pharyngeal openings are potentially fossilizable. In this context the body cones of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
are more similar to the apparently equivalent structures found in the vetulicolians and vetulocystids than they are to the pharyngeal structures of other deuterostomes 
1
, 
3
, 
7
, 
11
. Early deuterostomes have a through gut, so the apparent absence of an anus in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
could be secondary, as in brachiopods and ophiuroids. It remains possible, however, that this feature was inherited from more primitive bilaterians 
25
, possibly linked to the acoels and xenoturbellids 
24
, 
26
.
</p>
            <p>
We draw two main conclusions. First, some of the earliest deuterostomes were meiofaunal, and this finding complements proposals that such animals were benthic worms 
27
. In contrast, however, to the suggestions that early deuterostomes possessed an indirect life cycle with a feeding larva 
24
, the biology of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
seems more consistent with direct development 
28
. Previous work had emphasized the possible importance of the first stages of metazoan evolution occurring in a meiofaunal context 
29
. The discrepancy between the known fossil record of early metazoans and their estimated times of divergence 
30
as based on molecular clocks suggests that such miniaturized forms could slip through the nets of most fossilization pathways and so help to explain this cryptic history 
9
. Second, the body cone openings of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
are consistent with deuterostome body openings being very primitive 
8
, 
24

Forty-five phosphatized specimens are available (

, 

, Extended Data 

–6 and Supplementary Table 1). As with similar material from this horizon 
14
– 
16
and co-eval deposits 
17
, the phosphatic composition of the specimens is evidently the result of very early diagenesis. Extensive folding suggests that in life the integument was thin, flexible and only slightly sclerotized. The integument consists of two layers (Extended Data 

b, c, h, 3c, g, 5k, 6c, d), and frequently exhibits a fine-scale, densely spaced chevron-like folding on both external and internal surfaces (

b, Extended Data 

f–i, 3h, 4g and Supplementary Table 1). If original, this suggests that the integument was bi-layered.
</p>
            <p>
The body is hemi-ellipsoidal, with a maximum length of 1,300μm, width 800μm and height 900μm (Extended Data Fig. 7). Most material is crushed but several specimens (

g, h and Extended Data Figs 5g, h, 6a) confirm original bilateral symmetry. Otherwise, body orientations depend principally on identification of the mouth, and presumably the more dorsal and posterior location of the body cones and possibly sensory pores. Post-mortem deformation makes the precise dispositions of other structures more difficult to interpret. The most parsimonious conclusion, however, is that these features were also arranged bilaterally (

g, h and Extended Data Figs 4f, h 6a).
</p>
            <p>
The largest of the body openings (approximately 300–500 μm) is defined by a double circlet with prominent radial folds. The folds of the inner circlet are somewhat finer and this circlet also bears a series of oral protrusions, each consisting of an outer sheath and an inner peg-like structure (

a, d, e, g–i, 2a, b, d, e and Extended Data 

c, 3f, 4a, c, f, 5a, c, d, g, i). This double circlet is interpreted as the oral region, while the protrusions, notably the most anterior pair (Extended Data Figs 5g, i, 6f, g), may represent sensilla. The flexibility of the oral region is evident from both its lateral compression and dorsal arching (

a, d, e, i, 2d and Extended Data Figs 4a, e, 5a, c, d, g).
</p>
            <p>
Anterior to the oral region, the dorsal integument consists of up to four rugae with a nodular appearance (

a, d, 2a, b, d and Extended Data 

d, 4a, c, 5a, f). These may be separated by intervening integument or (presumably as a result of contraction) are closely adpressed with the nodular regions interlocked. Behind the rugae, the integument grades into a zone with longitudinal folds, but the posterior body is relatively smooth. Otherwise the most prominent structures are a series of body cones (

a, d, g, i, 2a, d, f, g and Extended Data 

a, b, d, h, 3a, c, d, g, 4b, d, f, h, 5a–c, e, g, k, 6). These vary in size (56–328 μm across), but all are formed of a series of ribs radiating from an unoccluded aperture. Up to eight body cones are visible, with the four body cones on the left and right sides extending in a more dorsal direction (

a). The first body cone is located immediately behind the oral region, and the body cone behind it is somewhat larger. The third body cone is the largest, and the most dorsal one is smaller. There are also two sets of small circular pores (30 μm across). One set is widely separated and runs parallel to the body cones (

a, g and Extended Data Figs 4f, h, 5g). The other set is more dorsal and consists of sub-linear arrays (

a, b, f, 2a, c, f, g and Extended Data 

a, d, e, j, 3a, d, e, 4f, h, 5b, h, j). Finally there are occasional conspicuous spines, with a wide base and elongate anterior taper (

c, 2h and Extended Data 

d, 5a, b, f, 6a). Strong folding makes the conclusion tentative, but no anus is evident (

a).
</p>
            <p>
The oral region could evidently distend, with its pleated arrangement accommodating changes in size. This, combined with dorsal arching, would allow ingestion of food particles and possibly somewhat larger prey 
18
. The size of mouth also suggests that water was swallowed, with the body cones being interpreted as exhalant structures. The dorsal extension of the body cones suggests that the corresponding oral cavity was also elongate. The more dorsal set of circular pores may represent the insertion points of setae. The other set adjacent to the body cones may have had a sensory function, although alternatively they could have released internal contents such as adhesive mucus or gametes.

The millimetric size of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
does not preclude a planktonic location, but its globular shape is consistent with a meiofaunal habit within what is now a phosphatic shelly limestone 
16
. Although we did not find exact counterparts amongst extant meiobenthic taxa, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
shows a suite of features consistent with an interstitial habitat 
18
. These include a thick but flexible cuticle, suitable for mechanical protection and wriggling between sediment grains, respectively (Extended Data 

c, d). The postulated setae, especially those towards the dorsal side, could perform a haptic role, including temporary attachment. Many meiofaunal taxa are progenetic and deciding whether 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
is best interpreted as a miniaturized adult or a larval stage has important implications for both potential life cycles and phylogenetic relationships. Evidence in favour of the former includes the observation that, despite a size range of 548–1,326 μm, the morphology is effectively invariant. More notable is that most extant larvae 
19
are ciliated and, although a few groups such as the bryozoans (cyphonautes) and loriciferans have thin cuticular coverings, they are unlike the relatively massive coat of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Irrespective of whether 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
is a progenetic relative of unknown macroscopic taxa, its closest relationships appear to lie with the vetulicolians and possibly vetulocystids. Forming part of a highly disparate suite of taxa, collectively they appear to represent early deuterostomes 
1
, 
20
, albeit ones not easily assigned to particular stem groups 
21
. Our phylogenetic analysis (

b, Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Information) confirms both the monophyly of the deuterostomes 
22
and component groups including vetulicolians plus banffiids and vetulocystids, but the position of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
remains less well constrained.
</p>
            <p>
With respect to vetulicolians, similarities with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
include the circum-oral radial structures and the body openings, interpreted as pharyngeal gills in the former group. In forms such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Didazoon
</tp:taxon-name>
12
the gills also have a convex exterior, although here the openings are directed posteriorly. Moreover, in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Didazoon
</tp:taxon-name>
the relative size of the openings in the posterior direction is similar to that seen in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
, notably with the third opening being conspicuously larger. In

the oral region shows variably developed pleating (Extended 
<tp:taxon-name>Data</tp:taxon-name>
Fig. 9), similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Similarities to the vetulocystids 
5
include body openings defined as truncated cones with well-developed radial ribs, albeit more numerous. The anterior body of vetulocystids is also strongly convoluted, and so reminiscent of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Very few characters unite the deuterostomes 
8
, 
22
, 
24
, and only the pharyngeal openings are potentially fossilizable. In this context the body cones of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
are more similar to the apparently equivalent structures found in the vetulicolians and vetulocystids than they are to the pharyngeal structures of other deuterostomes 
1
, 
3
, 
7
, 
11
. Early deuterostomes have a through gut, so the apparent absence of an anus in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
could be secondary, as in brachiopods and ophiuroids. It remains possible, however, that this feature was inherited from more primitive bilaterians 
25
, possibly linked to the acoels and xenoturbellids 
24
, 
26
.
</p>
            <p>
We draw two main conclusions. First, some of the earliest deuterostomes were meiofaunal, and this finding complements proposals that such animals were benthic worms 
27
. In contrast, however, to the suggestions that early deuterostomes possessed an indirect life cycle with a feeding larva 
24
, the biology of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
seems more consistent with direct development 
28
. Previous work had emphasized the possible importance of the first stages of metazoan evolution occurring in a meiofaunal context 
29
. The discrepancy between the known fossil record of early metazoans and their estimated times of divergence 
30
as based on molecular clocks suggests that such miniaturized forms could slip through the nets of most fossilization pathways and so help to explain this cryptic history 
9
. Second, the body cone openings of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
are consistent with deuterostome body openings being very primitive 
8
, 
24
. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
, however, diffusion across the body surface would have met any respiratory needs, suggesting that a transformation to specifically pharyngeal gills was linked to an increase in body size. If 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
lacked an anus, body openings may have originated to dispose of waste material.

Forty-five phosphatized specimens are available (

, 

, Extended Data 

–6 and Supplementary Table 1). As with similar material from this horizon 
14
– 
16
and co-eval deposits 
17
, the phosphatic composition of the specimens is evidently the result of very early diagenesis. Extensive folding suggests that in life the integument was thin, flexible and only slightly sclerotized. The integument consists of two layers (Extended Data 

b, c, h, 3c, g, 5k, 6c, d), and frequently exhibits a fine-scale, densely spaced chevron-like folding on both external and internal surfaces (

b, Extended Data 

f–i, 3h, 4g and Supplementary Table 1). If original, this suggests that the integument was bi-layered.
</p>
            <p>
The body is hemi-ellipsoidal, with a maximum length of 1,300μm, width 800μm and height 900μm (Extended Data Fig. 7). Most material is crushed but several specimens (

g, h and Extended Data Figs 5g, h, 6a) confirm original bilateral symmetry. Otherwise, body orientations depend principally on identification of the mouth, and presumably the more dorsal and posterior location of the body cones and possibly sensory pores. Post-mortem deformation makes the precise dispositions of other structures more difficult to interpret. The most parsimonious conclusion, however, is that these features were also arranged bilaterally (

g, h and Extended Data Figs 4f, h 6a).
</p>
            <p>
The largest of the body openings (approximately 300–500 μm) is defined by a double circlet with prominent radial folds. The folds of the inner circlet are somewhat finer and this circlet also bears a series of oral protrusions, each consisting of an outer sheath and an inner peg-like structure (

a, d, e, g–i, 2a, b, d, e and Extended Data 

c, 3f, 4a, c, f, 5a, c, d, g, i). This double circlet is interpreted as the oral region, while the protrusions, notably the most anterior pair (Extended Data Figs 5g, i, 6f, g), may represent sensilla. The flexibility of the oral region is evident from both its lateral compression and dorsal arching (

a, d, e, i, 2d and Extended Data Figs 4a, e, 5a, c, d, g).
</p>
            <p>
Anterior to the oral region, the dorsal integument consists of up to four rugae with a nodular appearance (

a, d, 2a, b, d and Extended Data 

d, 4a, c, 5a, f). These may be separated by intervening integument or (presumably as a result of contraction) are closely adpressed with the nodular regions interlocked. Behind the rugae, the integument grades into a zone with longitudinal folds, but the posterior body is relatively smooth. Otherwise the most prominent structures are a series of body cones (

a, d, g, i, 2a, d, f, g and Extended Data 

a, b, d, h, 3a, c, d, g, 4b, d, f, h, 5a–c, e, g, k, 6). These vary in size (56–328 μm across), but all are formed of a series of ribs radiating from an unoccluded aperture. Up to eight body cones are visible, with the four body cones on the left and right sides extending in a more dorsal direction (

a). The first body cone is located immediately behind the oral region, and the body cone behind it is somewhat larger. The third body cone is the largest, and the most dorsal one is smaller. There are also two sets of small circular pores (30 μm across). One set is widely separated and runs parallel to the body cones (

a, g and Extended Data Figs 4f, h, 5g). The other set is more dorsal and consists of sub-linear arrays (

a, b, f, 2a, c, f, g and Extended Data 

a, d, e, j, 3a, d, e, 4f, h, 5b, h, j). Finally there are occasional conspicuous spines, with a wide base and elongate anterior taper (

c, 2h and Extended Data 

d, 5a, b, f, 6a). Strong folding makes the conclusion tentative, but no anus is evident (

a).
</p>
            <p>
The oral region could evidently distend, with its pleated arrangement accommodating changes in size. This, combined with dorsal arching, would allow ingestion of food particles and possibly somewhat larger prey 
18
. The size of mouth also suggests that water was swallowed, with the body cones being interpreted as exhalant structures. The dorsal extension of the body cones suggests that the corresponding oral cavity was also elongate. The more dorsal set of circular pores may represent the insertion points of setae. The other set adjacent to the body cones may have had a sensory function, although alternatively they could have released internal contents such as adhesive mucus or gametes.

The millimetric size of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
does not preclude a planktonic location, but its globular shape is consistent with a meiofaunal habit within what is now a phosphatic shelly limestone 
16
. Although we did not find exact counterparts amongst extant meiobenthic taxa, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
shows a suite of features consistent with an interstitial habitat 
18
. These include a thick but flexible cuticle, suitable for mechanical protection and wriggling between sediment grains, respectively (Extended Data 

c, d). The postulated setae, especially those towards the dorsal side, could perform a haptic role, including temporary attachment. Many meiofaunal taxa are progenetic and deciding whether 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
is best interpreted as a miniaturized adult or a larval stage has important implications for both potential life cycles and phylogenetic relationships. Evidence in favour of the former includes the observation that, despite a size range of 548–1,326 μm, the morphology is effectively invariant. More notable is that most extant larvae 
19
are ciliated and, although a few groups such as the bryozoans (cyphonautes) and loriciferans have thin cuticular coverings, they are unlike the relatively massive coat of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Irrespective of whether 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
is a progenetic relative of unknown macroscopic taxa, its closest relationships appear to lie with the vetulicolians and possibly vetulocystids. Forming part of a highly disparate suite of taxa, collectively they appear to represent early deuterostomes 
1
, 
20
, albeit ones not easily assigned to particular stem groups 
21
. Our phylogenetic analysis (

b, Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Information) confirms both the monophyly of the deuterostomes 
22
and component groups including vetulicolians plus banffiids and vetulocystids, but the position of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
remains less well constrained.
</p>
            <p>
With respect to vetulicolians, similarities with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
include the circum-oral radial structures and the body openings, interpreted as pharyngeal gills in the former group. In forms such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Didazoon
</tp:taxon-name>
12
the gills also have a convex exterior, although here the openings are directed posteriorly. Moreover, in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Didazoon
</tp:taxon-name>
the relative size of the openings in the posterior direction is similar to that seen in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
, notably with the third opening being conspicuously larger. In

the oral region shows variably developed pleating (Extended 
<tp:taxon-name>Data</tp:taxon-name>
Fig. 9), similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Similarities to the vetulocystids 
5
include body openings defined as truncated cones with well-developed radial ribs, albeit more numerous. The anterior body of vetulocystids is also strongly convoluted, and so reminiscent of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Very few characters unite the deuterostomes 
8
, 
22
, 
24
, and only the pharyngeal openings are potentially fossilizable. In this context the body cones of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
are more similar to the apparently equivalent structures found in the vetulicolians and vetulocystids than they are to the pharyngeal structures of other deuterostomes 
1
, 
3
, 
7
, 
11
. Early deuterostomes have a through gut, so the apparent absence of an anus in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
could be secondary, as in brachiopods and ophiuroids. It remains possible, however, that this feature was inherited from more primitive bilaterians 
25
, possibly linked to the acoels and xenoturbellids 
24
, 
26
.
</p>
            <p>
We draw two main conclusions. First, some of the earliest deuterostomes were meiofaunal, and this finding complements proposals that such animals were benthic worms 
27
. In contrast, however, to the suggestions that early deuterostomes possessed an indirect life cycle with a feeding larva 
24
, the biology of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
seems more consistent with direct development 
28
. Previous work had emphasized the possible importance of the first stages of metazoan evolution occurring in a meiofaunal context 
29
. The discrepancy between the known fossil record of early metazoans and their estimated times of divergence 
30
as based on molecular clocks suggests that such miniaturized forms could slip through the nets of most fossilization pathways and so help to explain this cryptic history 
9
. Second, the body cone openings of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
are consistent with deuterostome body openings being very primitive 
8
, 
24
. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
, however, diffusion across the body surface would have met any respiratory needs, suggesting that a transformation to specifically pharyngeal gills was linked to an increase in body size. If 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccorhytus
</tp:taxon-name>
lacked an anus, body openings may have originated to dispose of waste material.
