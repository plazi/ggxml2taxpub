         <p> Introduction </p>
         <p> Invasive species are acknowledged as economic, environmental or social threats ( ; ; ),
            becoming key components of global change ( ; ) through their high adaptive capacity
            which enables them to penetrate natural geographic barriers or political boundaries ( ;
            ; ; ). As a result, invasive species are characterised by remarkable spatio-temporal
            dynamics, thus becoming successfully established and spread over extended areas in
            Europe, triggering significant environmental and socio-economic damages ( ; ). It is
            estimated that only 0.1% of the introduced species became invasive ( ). However, at
            European level, in the last two centuries, an increasing number of species have become
            capable of spreading on an annual average of 6.2 neophytes ( , ). In protected areas, in
            particular, biological invasions are disturbing drivers for ecosystem functioning and
            structure, as well as for species, species communities or habitats ( ). The site
            features that have been associated with invasibility include both environmental and
            anthropogenic factors such as disturbance ( ; ), proximity to roads ( ), soil nutrients,
            topographic position and forest fragmentation ( ; , ). </p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> is considered one of the most invasive
            species, native to the south-eastern part of North America, widely introduced in North
            Asia and Europe ( ). In Romania, the species has been cultivated prior to the nineteenth
            century ( ; ). Since 1975, it has become invasive and after 1985, it has spread over
            broader areas proving the high capacity for widening its habitat ( ). However, it became
            adapted to different types of habitats such as: river banks (poplar or willow galleries,
            almond willow-osier scrubs), unvegetated or sparsely vegetated shores, water-fringing
            reed-beds, riverine and lakeshore scrubs ( ), as well as mesophyle and xeromesophyle
            meadows in western Romania ( ). Recent studies consider that <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> is one of the worst invaders in wetland habitats ( ), a
            real competitor to native plant or riverine scrubs ( ) with high capacity to remove
            indigenous species ( ). </p>
         <p> Recent interdisciplinary studies conducted in the framework of FP7 enviroGRIDS project
            - Building Capacity for a Black Sea Catchment Observation and Assessment supporting
            Sustainable Development (WP5 - Impacts on Selected Societal Benefit; Sub-task 5.6.2:
            Terrestrial Invasive Plant Species in Romanian Protected Areas) have identified and
            assessed <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> in the Danube Delta Biosphere
            Reserve, Comana and Mures Floodplain Natural Parks in relation to species preference for
            different natural and human-induced conditions ( Dumitrascu and Grigorescu 2016). Thus,
            large areas covered with <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> were spotted in
            wetlands, along forest roads, in arable lands, in the proximity of transport routes etc.
            ( ; ; ). In 2016, a first synthesis work, representing a geographical approach of the
            invasive terrestrial plant species in the Romanian protected areas, was elaborated. The
            volume includes various aspects connected with the <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> and its impact on the protected ecosystems, as well as
            relevant environmental and anthropogenic driving factors which influence its potential
            spread ( Dumitrascu and Grigorescu 2016). As a result, a first methodology, aiming to
            assess the spatial potential distribution of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name>
            in important wetland protected areas, was elaborated. Hence, based on the GIS spatial
            and statistical analysis, the frequency of the invasive species in relation to its
            natural and human-induced driving factors was calculated in order to identify different
            ecological requirements in various habitat types aimed at modelling the areas with
            different potential distribution ( ). </p>
         <p> Limited resources are available for the control of these plants ( ). Given this
            constraint, the mapping and assessment of invasive species' potential distribution can
            provide a useful tool for investigating its dynamics at different spatial scales. Thus,
            numerous studies use logistic regression to identify and quantify the strength of
            association between invasive plant presence and environmental and anthropogenic factors
            and to model their potential spread in new areas (e.g. ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ). In this
            respect, based on GIS spatial and statistical analysis, within the current research, two
            objectives have been achieved: (1) to identify which of the analysed explanatory driving
            factors better contribute to the explanation of <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence and (2) to generate a probability map in order
            to identify the areas with different potential for <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> spreading in the Mure»ô Floodplain Natural Park. The results
            of the current study might be useful for the administration of Mure»ô Floodplain Natural
            Park in terms of directing the management efforts towards monitoring the areas at high
            risk of being affected by invasive species and as support for thorough future research
            at finer spatial scales. </p>

         <title>N/A</title>
         <p>Materials and methods</p>
         <p>The study-area</p>
         <p> Mures Floodplain Natural Park is located in the western part of Romania ( 20¬∞53'E ;
            46¬∞07'N ) in the Panonic biogeographic region (Fig. 1). The study-area covers 17,455 ha
            and overlaps the lower part of the Mures River (tributary of Tisa River), occupying the
            embanked enclosure of the river between the city of Arad and the state border with
            Hungary ( ). </p>
         <p> The Mures Floodplain Natural Park, established in 2004 through Government Decision no.
            2151/2004, falls into V IUCN category - Protected Landscape (Natural Park) and Natura
            2000 European Network, both SPA - Special Protection Areas and SCI - Site of Community
            Importance. Furthermore, since 2006, the area was included on the RAMSAR list as
            Wetlands of International Importance. The Park is a typical wet land area with running
            and still waters, alluvial forests, as well as an important place for nesting and
            passage for a large number of bird species of international importance ( ), hosting
            specific wetland habitats and species of conservation interest within four nature
            reserves: Prundu Mare-Pecica, Igris Isles, Insula Mare Cenad and Cenad Forest ( ). </p>
         <p> Generally, the area is a floodplain with altitudes decreasing from about 110 m (in
            east) to about 80 m (in west). The climate is temperate-continental with oceanic humid
            influences ( ), with almost 10-11 ¬∞C mean annual air temperature and 500-600 mm mean
            annual precipitation ( ). Forests (in the eastern half) and agricultural land (mainly
            arable) represent the main land use/cover category of the Park. </p>
         <p> According to the geographical distribution of habitats, the importance of the species
            and management, the Park is divided into three different zones: (1) the totally
            protected area (6%) which includes the most valuable natural elements, (2) the
            sustainable management area (92%), also called the buffer zone, which makes the
            transition between the totally protected area and (3) the sustainable development area
            (2%) which includes built-up areas or natural resources exploitation sites that existed
            prior to the designation of the protected area. Within the totally protected area, any
            form of use of natural resources, construction or investments which do not meet the
            sustainable management of the protected natural area and/or scientific research
            activities is forbidden. In the buffer zone, it is prohibited to build new
            constructions, except for those that strictly serve the protected natural area, the
            scientific research activities or those meant to ensure national safety or the
            prevention of natural disasters. Investments or development activities are accepted in
            the sustainable development area, priority being given to tourism, albeit respecting the
            sustainable use of natural resources and the prevention of any significant negative
            effects on biodiversity ( ). </p>
         <p>Methodology</p>
         <p> The current study aims to explain the relationships between <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence and its explanatory driving forces, on one hand
            and to model the probability of the potential distribution using spatial analysis and
            binary logistic regression (BLR), on the other. The methodology, used in the present
            study, includes three main stages: the extraction of the geospatial datasets, the
            spatial analysis using GIS and the statistical analysis using SPSS (Statistical Package
            for the Social Sciences) software package. Synthetically, Figure 2 describes the
            methodology applied to calibrate, simulate and validate the model in order to assess the
            potential distribution of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> in Mures
            Floodplain Natural Park. </p>
         <p>Data and data processing</p>
         <p> Based on field research findings, as well as on data availability, eight spatial
            datasets representing the dependent and the independent variables (Fig. 3) were employed
            to model the probability of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> 's potential
            distribution: <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> presence/absence (AF), soil
            type (ST), depth to water (DW), proximity to water (PW), Normalised Difference
            Vegetation Index (NDVI), proximity to near roads (PR), forest fragmentation (FF) and
            proximity to near settlements (PS). Due to the relative homogenous topographical char
            acteristics with rather insignificant altitudinal difference (about 30 m), as well as to
            its longitudinal and latitudinal low extension (00¬∞47' and 00¬∞07', respectively), the
            explanatory factors related to climate and relief were not considered. Moreover, the
            scale of the study area, coupled with the particular local environmental features, makes
            this research a valuable local-scale approach, allowing a better understanding of the
            environmental issues and an increased potential for being included into the
            decision-making process. Thus, we consider that such an approach can be replicated to
            other geographical areas with similar environmental conditions or extrapolated from
            local to regional scales. </p>
         <p> Dependent variable: <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence </p>
         <p> The layer of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> presence/absence in the Mures
            Floodplain Natural Park was derived from the data collected during the field surveys
            which were carried out between 2012 and 2016. The mapping was realised using topographic
            maps (1:25000 scale) and, for more accuracy, using orthophoto images (scale 1:5000) and
            GPS measurements. The species was identified in various habitat types where field
            releves with over 20% coverage (according to Braun - Blanquet scale) and frequency
            (according to Raunkiaer scale) were taken into consideration ( ). Thus, the total mapped
            area covers a surface of 363 ha, including polygons with different coverage of
               <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> . </p>
         <p> With respect to the dataset used to model the probability map, a binary raster with the
            categories "presence" (coded with 1) and "absence" (coded with 0) was generated (Fig.
            3), in order to discriminate the cells with <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name>
            occurrence from the non-occurrence. </p>
         <p>Explanatory factors</p>
         <p>After processing different maps (topographic, soil and hydrogeological) and orthophoto
            images, six thematic layers were extracted and analysed: soil characteristics,
            piezometric level, surface waters, forests, built-up areas and roads from where soil
            type, depth to water, forest fragmentation, distance to roads, distance to waters and
            distance to settlements were derived.</p>
         <p> In order to assess the occurrence of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> within
            the dominant vegetation cover, the NDVI(Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) was
            used. This index was calculated using the Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS (Operational Land
            Imager_Thermal Infrared Sensor, accessed July 18, 2017) acquired from the United States
            Geological Survey - USGS (portal available at http://www.usgs.gov/). This index,
            developed by Rouse et al. in 1974 and widely used for the remote sensing of vegetation,
            is a measure of surface reflectance and gives a quantitative estimation of vegetation
            growth and biomass ( ). The NDVI values were obtained by employing the following
            formula: </p>
         <p>, (Eq.1)</p>
         <p>where NIR = reflectance in the near infrared band; RED = reflectance in the red
            (visible) band.</p>
         <p> The resultant NDVI values ranged between -0.245 and 0.714. After the visual
            interpretation of orthophoto images, the NDVI values were considered as representing: no
            vegetation areas (aquatic surface, bare soils, built-up areas, recent riverbed deposits)
            (NDVI &lt;0); agricultural crops (NDVI = 0 ... 0.25); herbaceous vegetation (NDVI = 0.25
            ... 0.4); transitional woodland-scrub (0.40 ... 0.55); forest vegetation (NDVI&gt;0.55). </p>
         <p> Total edge (TE), calculated as the sum of the lengths (m) of all edge segments in a
            class or landscape ( ) was used to quantify the forest fragmentation. In this case, the
            TE was calculated just for the forested class, in a 25 ha window size, using Patch
            Analyst ( ), a GIS tool developed to analyse spatial landscape patches and model the
            attributes associated with patches, according to numerous statistical metrics. The
            resultant values were categorised in: slightly fragmented forests (TE &lt;2000 m);
            moderate fragmented forests (TE = 2000 ... 5000 m); highly fragmented forests
            (TE&gt;5000 m). Moreover, based on the Euclidean multiple ring buffers, maps depicting
            the distance to roads (buffer = 0.1 km), waters (buffer = 0.5 km) and settlements
            (buffer = 0.5 km) were created. Twenty-one binary rasters were generated to distinguish
            the ten soil type classes, three piezometric levels, three forest fragmentation classes
            and five NDVI classes. Finally, twenty-four categorical and continuous independent
            variables were prepared and homogenised as raster with 30 x 30 m cell (equivalent to the
            spatial resolution of the Landsat image used to derive NDVI) for further spatial and
            statistical analyses (Table 1). For these variables, several assumptions related to
            location suitability were presumed in order to explore the relationship between the
            invasive species and its explanatory factors. </p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>Statistical analysis</p>
         <p> In the present study, to assess the relationships of the site characteristics and
               <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> presence/absence, BLR was applied. This
            method is the most commonly used parametric model aimed at determining the empirical
            relationships between a dependent and several independent variables ( ), where the
            dependent variable is a binary presence (1) or absence event (0) and the independent
            variables are categorical and/or continuous variables. If binary values 1 and 0 are used
            to represent <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence and no occurrence,
            respectively, the probability of the presence of the species for any specific grid cell
            was calculated using the logistic curve as described by the logistic function ( ): </p>
         <p>, (Eq.2)</p>
         <p>then the probability of occurrence can be estimated with the following logistic
            regression model:</p>
         <p>, (Eq.3)</p>
         <p> where P(Y =1|X1, X2, ..., Xi) is the probability of the dependent variable Y being 1
            given (X1, X2, ..., Xi), i.e. the probability of a cell of being invaded by invasive
            species; Xi is an independent variable representing the explanatory factors of
               <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> and Œ≤i is the coefficient for variable
            Xi. </p>
         <p> The response of these regression functions is visualised into the raster probability
            map based on the location suitability, given the probability of the occurrence of
               <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> in each resultant raster cell. </p>
         <p> In order to reduce the effects of multi-collinearity, before the logistic regression
            analysis, Pearson correlations between each pair of independent variables were conducted
            and examined. In case of strong correlations (min. +/- 0.7), the better predictor
            variable (in univariate trials) was retained. Furthermore, to verify the explanatory
            power of the variables included in the sub-model, the Cramer's V statistics tool was
            used. Cramer's V is a statistic that transforms chi-square (for a contingency table
            larger than two rows by two columns) to a range of 0-1, where unit value indicates
            complete agreement between the two nominal variables ( ). The test procedure is based on
            contingency table analysis which can test the strength of the association between the
            dependent variable and both continuous and categorical independent variables. </p>
         <p>Model calibration and assessment of potential distribution</p>
         <p> The BLR was performed using the backward stepwise method in SPSS in order to obtain the
            best-fit combination for predictors. Thus, the variables, which collectively best
            explain <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence, were adopted by the
            regression model. To indicate the effectiveness of the each sets, a Nagelkerke pseudo R
            square ( ) was determined. Furthermore, ROC/AUC (Relative Operating Characteristic/Area
            Under Curve) was used to test the "goodness of fit" ( ). In the standard ROC approach,
            the predictive probability map is compared with the map of the true binary event in
            order to assess the spatial coincidence between the event and the probability values (
            ). This graph displays the predictive accuracy of the logistic model, which can be
            evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC). A completely random model gives a
            ROC value of 0.5, while a perfect fit results in a ROC value of 1.0. For the best-fit
            combination for resultant predictors, the maximum likelihood estimator ( ) was
            determined. In the BLR, the model is considered to fit if the value of the
            Hosmer-Lemeshow test shows a value higher than p-value (0.05). </p>
         <p> Based on the corresponding coefficients of the best Ô¨Åt predictor set, the relative
            contribution of the explanatory variables of the <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence was assessed and the potential distribution
            probability map was generated. To categorise the resultant map, five classes were used
            to classify the probability values: very high, high, medium, low and very low
            probability. The classification was performed by Natural breaks (Jenks), a method that
            seeks to reduce the variance within classes and to maximise the variance between classes
            ( ), commonly used in GIS techniques for grouping spatial values that are not evenly
            distributed. </p>
         <p> Spatial validation </p>
         <p> Usually, in the analysis and modelling of spatial data, real datasets are used to
            validate the performance using different techniques. A typical procedure is splitting
            data into two parts ( ): training set (used to develop the model) and validation set
            (used to estimate the ability of the model). The proportions of data included in each
            dataset are somewhat arbitrary and dependent on the total mapped area available, 70% for
            calibration and 30% for validation being commonly used ( ). According to the available
            datasets representing <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence (mapped)
            and to build the model with a significant percent for the training set, in the present
            study a 70%/30% training/validation split was considered. Furthermore, to eliminate
            sampling biases and associated subjectivism, the random-partition was used to extract
            the data for validation. Then, based on the cross-classiÔ¨Åcation technique, the analysis
            between validation dataset and probability map was achieved and the frequency of the
               <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence was identified and quantified
            for each probability class. </p>

         <p>Results</p>
         <p> The occurrence of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> in relation to the
            analysed explanatory variables </p>
         <p> In terms of the analysed explanatory factors, <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> distribution across the park has a relative spatial
            heterogeneity. The frequency analysis (Fig. 4) shows that <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurs in various conditions but with differences mainly
            according to the soil type, vegetation cover and distance to roads. In relation to soil
            type, <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> overlaps largely protisols and
            fluvisols (92% of the total mapped area). Similar to the soil particularities, the roads
            appear to have the most important role in facilitating the establishment of
               <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> . In detail, the frequency of species
            related to distance to nearest roads, calculated for 0.1 km buffer rings, shows that 68%
            of the mapped area is identified in the first 0.1 km and 91% in the first 0.2 km. In
            relation to the depth to water, the most significant areas with <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> (58%) were mapped in the high floodplain, the sand banks
            and floodplain terraces where the aquifer level is situated at 2.0-5.0 m depth. In
            relation to the forest fragmentation, <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> was
            mainly found (69%) in the moderate fragmented forests (TE = 2000-5000 m/25 ha). Related
            to NDVI values, the large occurrence of A. fruticoasa (46%) is mainly related to values
            ranging between 0.40 and 0.55, thus indicating a preference of the invasive species for
            transitional woodland-scrub. Furthermore, the notable occurrence (25%), in relation to
            the highest NDVI values (&gt;0.55) and 17% in relation to the medium positive NDVI
            values (0.25-0.40), indicate also a preference for forest vegetation and grasslands. In
            relation to the water's vicinity, 55% of the total mapped areas with <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> are situated close to the Mure»ô River, within the first 0.5
            km buffer ring. The frequency distribution of <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> indicates also an increasing occurrence in relation to the
            distance to settlements. Thus, 43% of the total mapped areas are distributed in the
            first 1 km and 73% in the first 2 km buffer rings. </p>
         <p>Correlation analysis amongst the explanatory variables</p>
         <p> The Pearson correlation analysis between the independent variables showed that the
            variables were not highly inter-correlated (max. +/- 0.30), which suggests the absence
            of multi-collinearity. The highest values were found between NDVI (&gt;0.55) and
            slightly fragmented forests (0.298), depth to water (&lt;2 m) and protisols (0.255). The
            lowest coefÔ¨Åcients (0.001) were found between slightly fragmented forests and chernozems
            soil type, moderate fragmented forests and depth to water (&gt;5 m), NDVI (0-0.25) and
            lacovishte soil type. </p>
         <p> Association between dependent variable and explanatory variables using Cramer's V test </p>
         <p> The explanatory power of the independents' variables was tested based on the Cramer's V
            statistics. According to this method, the analysed explanatory factors were not strongly
            associated with <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence. Overall,
            continuous and few categorical variables were found to have better association with
               <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence with Cramer's V values between
            1.5 and 2.3: proximity to roads (V = 0.224), proximity to settlements (V = 0.221),
            proximity to waters (V = 0.193), piezometric level &lt;2 m (V = 0.151), moderate forest
            fragmentation (V = 0.161) and NDVI values between 0 and 0.25 (V = 0.152). Furthermore,
            except for erodisols (V = 0.143), protisols (V = 0.122), fluvisols (V = 0.113),
            piezometric level between 2 and 5 m (V = 0.114), highly fragmented forests (V = 0.105)
            and NDVI values between 0.25 and 0.40 (V = 0.11), remaining variables have values less
            than 0.1, indicating a weakly association with the <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence. </p>
         <p>Logistic regression modelling</p>
         <p> Setting the backward stepwise in the BLR, eight steps for the best predictor sets
            resulted (Table 2). Variables that were not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant , associated with
               <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence within the 95% conÔ¨Ådence
            interval, were identiÔ¨Åed and automatically excluded by the model. Thus, the best-fit
            combination for predictors was found in step eight, which includes seventeen explanatory
            factors (Table 3). </p>
         <p> </p>
         <p> </p>
         <p> For set-8, the regression "goodness of fit" measured by the Nagelkerke R2 is -0.243
            which, according to , indicates that the model is a good Ô¨Åt for the data. Therewith,
            also stated that pseudo R2 value between 0.2 and 0.4 can be considered as an extremely
            good Ô¨Åt . The predictor set-8 also attained the highest accuracy (AUC=0.798) showing a
            prediction ability of 79.8% of the model. Furthermore, the Hosmer-Lemeshow significance
            test resulted in Chi-square = 13.39 and p = 0.063 (&gt;0.05), indicating a good fit of
            the model. </p>
         <p> The relative contribution of the explanatory factors was evaluated using the
            corresponding coefÔ¨Åcients in the BLR (Table 3). Based on the coefÔ¨Åcients' values, all
            the explanatory variables were ranked. Thus, amongst all variables, erodisols, protisols
            and luvisols were found as the most signiÔ¨Åcant predictors for <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence in the study area. All values of OR are greater
            than one, indicating a higher probability of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name>
            occurrence in those areas comparing to other soil type classes. The probability of
               <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence in areas with erodisols is
            larger than the probability in areas covered with protisols. The areas with protisols
            present more suitability for <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence than
            areas with luvisols. This can be seen from the odds ratio values of 18.59, 8.17 and 6.96
            in a decreasing order for erodisols, protisols and luvisols, respectively. </p>
         <p> The regression model showed a positive relationship between <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence and depth to water for piezometric level less
            than 2 m and between 2 and 5 m and negative relation with respect to a piezometric level
            higher than 5 m. This means that, with the increase in depth to water, the
               <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence decreases due to less
            connectivity to groundwater. This can be seen in the odds ratio values (4.89, 2.38 and
            0.35) in a decreasing order for the piezometric level. Furthermore, the positive values
            of Œ≤ and OR show that <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> tends to spread in
            moderate and mainly highly fragmented forests. However, the positive values of Œ≤ (0.19)
            and the value of OR greater than one (1.21) for slightly fragmented forests also
            demonstrate that the species can spread in rather compacted afforested areas. </p>
         <p> The model also demonstrates that <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> is in
            relation to vegetation cover, the positive Œ≤ coefficients and OR values for NDVI
            values&gt;0.25 showing the tendency of species to spread in areas with grasslands,
            transitional woodland-scrub and afforested areas. The estimated Œ≤ value (-0.694) and OR
            (0.50) for the proximity to roads indicates that the probability of <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence further away from roads is less expected.
            SpeciÔ¨Åcally , the probability of species occurrence would decrease 2 times if distance
            to roads increases by 0.1 km. The model demonstrates that <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence is not significantly controlled by the proximity
            to settlements, however the negative value of Œ≤ (-0.16) indicates that, with the
            increase in distance to settlements, the probability of this invasive terrestrial
            species to occur decreases. Thus, the odds of <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence in an area 0.5 km closer to settlements is
            estimated to be 1.17 as large as that in areas further away from settlements. </p>
         <p> The regression results for proximity to waters (Œ≤ = 0.006; OR = 1.006) revealed that
            they have no significant influence on <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name>
            occurrence. </p>
         <p> The probability map of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence </p>
         <p> The probability of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence was assessed
            by plugging the Œ≤ coefficients of the logistic regression model containing the 17
            signiÔ¨Åcant predictors (Table 3) into Eq. (3). Thus, the probability map (Fig. 5)
            indicated that 24.9% of the grid cells have high and very high suitability for
               <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence, largely in the eastern half
            of the Park, close to Felnac, Pecica and Semlac localities. Here, the suitability is
            mainly characterised by the favourable soil type, the presence of numerous agricultural
            and forestry roads and the large extension of the pastures and transitional
            woodland-scrub vegetation. On the other hand, the lowest probability values are in the
            western (near Cenad locality), north-eastern and southern parts of the protected area
            (near Arad and Secusigiu localities) where the unsuitable soil type classes and
            piezometric level ranking between 2 and 5 m or arable lands and compacted forests are
            predominant. </p>
         <p> In order to conduct the spatial validation of the model, the map of <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence probability, computed using the logistic
            regression model, was compared with the actual <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence (reference datasets used for validation). Thus,
            the cross-classiÔ¨Åcation map reveals a relatively good spatial fit between the observed
            data and the predicted data (Fig. 6). Both very high and high probability classes
            include 69.9% of total cells, representing the real <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> location used as the validation dataset. Furthermore, only
            10% of the total pixels, representing the real <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> used as the validation dataset, overlap the very low and
            low probability classes. </p>

         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> location in the Mure»ô Floodplain Natural
            Park </p>
         <p> The field surveys in the Mure»ô Floodplain Natural Park have shown <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence in different ecosystems and habitats,
            significantly affecting the native vegetation. The species were identified mainly along
            the forest roads edges and forest glades (especially north to Mure»ô River), as well as
            along the edges of arable lands (mainly abandoned, unused) with a tendency to invade
            them in the west and north-west of Felnac locality. The largest area was identified in
            the western part of Pecica locality and north-west of Fenlac, along the forest roads and
            at the contact between forested areas and pastures or arable lands. Therewith, the
            species has a significant spread south-west of Seitin locality on arable lands and along
            Mures River (Fig. 7). Selected biological indices (coverage, frequency, abundance)
            computed in six representative sites during the field research, indicate a preference
            mainly for the riparian habitats (with <tp:taxon-name>Salix alba</tp:taxon-name> and
               <tp:taxon-name>Populus alba</tp:taxon-name> ), alluvial forest (with
               <tp:taxon-name>Alnus glutinosa</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Fraxinus
               excelsior</tp:taxon-name> ), riparian mixed forests (with <tp:taxon-name>Quercus
               robur</tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>Ulmus laevis</tp:taxon-name> ,
               <tp:taxon-name>U. minor</tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>Fraxinus
               excelsior</tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>F. angustifolia</tp:taxon-name> ) and
            muddy banks (with <tp:taxon-name>Chenopodium rubri</tp:taxon-name> pp and
               <tp:taxon-name>Bidention</tp:taxon-name> vegetation). </p>
         <p> In relation to park zoning, out of the total mapped surface, 1.7% is located in the
            totally protected area (Felnac, Libus), 13.6% in the sustainable development area
            (largely in Pecica locality), while the remainder (84.7%) is in the sustainable
            management area, mainly spreading along the left bank of Mures River. </p>
         <p> The main explanatory factors of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence.
            Expected invasion </p>
         <p> The driving factors of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence may vary
            from place to place. Many factors can affect the establishment and spread of invasive
            species ( ). They include the interaction of multiple environmental variables, such as
            elevation, precipitation and soil type, which constitute the species' fundamental niche
            ( ; ). Invasive species have also been associated with areas of distur bance , either
            natural (e.g. Ô¨Åre or Ô¨Çoods ; ; ) or human related ( ; ) and inÔ¨Çuenced by abiotic
            factors, such as historical land use and management ( ). </p>
         <p> In the present study, the selected explanatory variables encompass a significant share
            of the driving factors. Many studies have indicated that most of the analysed factors
            were also found to be important in other protected wetland areas in Romania ( , , ; ; ),
            as well as in the other European countries ( ; ; ). In the present study, the model
            shows that <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> is mainly controlled by the soil,
            groundwater's availability, predominant vegetation type in the invaded areas and
            human-induced disturbance (forest fragmentation, roads extension). SpeciÔ¨Åcally , amongst
            all analysed explanatory factors, erodisols, protisols and luvisols were found as the
            most signiÔ¨Åcant categorical predictors for <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name>
            occurrence in the Mures Floodplain Natural Park. It should be noted that, in the study
            area, these classes of soil types cover about 80% of the total area, thus indicating a
            significant potential for <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> to spread in large
            areas of the park. The model also proved a significant relationship between the
            piezometric level and <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> distribution
            indicating species' requirements for water availability in the soil. </p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> is considered a weak competitor in forests
            because it is usually excluded by tree species ( ), but due to its fast growth, shading
            and probably its allelopathic effects ( ) and nitrogen-fixing ability ( ), it is a
            superior transformer in grasslands ( ). In the present study, the model confirms the
            strong adaptability of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> in grasslands areas.
            However, it can be noticed that the regression coefficients for highest values of NDVI
            also show the tendency of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> to spread in the
            transitional woodland- scrub and afforested areas. This can indicate the adaptation
            capacity to any terrestrial ecosystems and, consequently, a tolerance for semi-shade.
            Furthermore, the model indicates the preference of <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> for fragmented forests, confirming that forest
            fragmentation could increase the ecosystems' vulnerability to invasive species and
            habitat decline ( ). </p>
         <p> It is widely known that roads can serve as corridors for the movement of invasive
            species ( ), as well as for providing main habitats for establishment ( ). In other
            Romanian protected areas, large areas covered by <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> were spotted in wetlands, along the forest roads ( ; ).
            This can be explained by their influence in ecosystems fragmentation through creating
            suitable areas for invasive species growth. For the present-study, the regression
            results indicate that the proximity to roads was the predictor that has the most
            important contribution for <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence
            amongst the continuous driving factors. On the other hand, the continuity and the
            patterns of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence along the roads show
            the very important role of roads in facilitating the movement of this invasive plant.
            Moreover, the road traffic close to the Park's border can favour species' expansion,
            having been known for its tolerance to polluting environments ( ; ; ). The development
            of the invasive species on contaminated areas was confirmed within another protected
            area of Romania (Comana Natural Park), where the large spread of <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> along the main roads and non-electrified railroad was
            observed ( ). The model does not demonstrate that <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence is significantly controlled by the proximity to
            settlements. However, the negative value of regression coefficients shows that the
            presence of the invasive plant species could be facilitated by human activities,
            indicating that the disturbed habitats inside and close to the settlements are easier to
            invade. This study also revealed that the proximity of aquatic surfaces has no
            significant influence on <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence.
            However, the positive regression coefficients, as well as the mapped areas with
               <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> (59%) within the first 500 m distance to
            Mures River, could be explained through the favourable specific microclimate or fluvial
            processes within the riverbed which can favour the growth of invasive species to the
            detriment of riparian vegetation. In addition, the occurrence of <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> along the riverbed could be also explained by the fact that
            rivers are regularly considered natural vectors for invasive species dissemination ( ). </p>
         <p> In this respect, the authors consider that the more ecosystems and habitats are
            affected by disturbance, the more likely they become invaded by <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> . Thus, future forest fragmentation and clearing, the
            extension of the transportation network and the abandonment of the agricultural lands
            will increase the potential spread of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> .
            Furthermore, planting <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> for different purposes
            (on the degraded lands, protection of dams or roads) will facilitate species' invasion
            within the important habitats and ecosystems of the Park. </p>
         <p> Importance of the study. Perspectives </p>
         <p> Invasive species may cause cascading effects in communities and/or affect both biotic
            and abiotic components of ecosystems ( ) bringing in substantial costs to agriculture,
            forest and human health ( ), as well as to ecosystem services, affecting ecosystem
            structure and function ( ), loss of biodiversity or unique habitats. Invasive plants may
            decrease the suitability of soil for native species ( ), disturbing soil formation,
            nutrient components or altering microbial communities. As a result, detailed knowledge
            of species' ecological and geographic distribution is critical for effective
            conservation planning and modelling of its potential spread. However, data about most of
            species occurrence is sparse, resulting in incomplete information about species
            distribution, which leads to its difficult control and monitoring in sensitive areas
            (e.g. protected areas, wetlands). Hence, species distribution models attempt to provide
            detailed spatial data by relating presence of species to environmental predictors ( ; ;
            ). In the current study, in order to identify and inventory <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> , as well as to develop a potential distribution model for
            the entire protected area, integrating GIS and logistic regression have been performed,
            given that we consider that the resultant map would provide the necessary information
            for the effective management of native ecosystems in the study area. Since the river
            systems are considered as main transport corridors for the invasive plants ( ),
            characterised by natural disturbances that create suitable sites for invasive species (
            ), it can be appreciated that <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> expansion
            could represent an important trans-border ecological issue given that Mures River
            represents an important tributary of the Tisa River in the Danube Basin area. More than
            that, this can be critical given that the Danube is considered one of the most important
            routes for spreading invasive species, owing to its long distance, fluctuating water
            level and long-time anthropogenic presence, which facilitate these invasions ( ). Due to
            the resultant map indicating a significant susceptibility to invasion, we consider that,
            without careful management, the important habitats and essential ecosystem processes in
            large fluvial areas in the Mures Floodplain Natural Park could be seriously disturbed in
            a relatively short time. Hence, the resultant outcomes could become important tools for
            the park's administration to adopt appropriate planning strategies for the
            eradication/limitation of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> in view of
            conserving the biodiversity of native flora and, finally, to provide the sustainable
            development of this protected area. On the other hand, the database containing the
            spatial distribution of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> can serve the park's
            administration and research as useful information about the location of the invasive
            species in order to monitor and carry out an assessment of the quantitative rates of
            dispersal in different habitats and ecosystems within the protected area, but also
            cross-boundary, knowing the relative continuity of the environmental conditions which
            provides suitable habitats for potential expansion. Furthermore, the results might be
            also used in other similar sites where <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name>
            occurs in order to identify the areas that can be potentially invaded by this
            terrestrial invasive plant species. Given that this invasive plant is strongly
            associated with some landscape features such as soil type, depth to water, vegetation
            cover or roads, it is also essential to incorporate this knowledge into the assessment
            of potential spreading of other invasive terrestrial plant species in other sites. In
            addition, the probability map generated in this study can provide the basis for scenario
            analysis where independent variables can be improved and modified according to the
            specific biophysical and anthropogenic changes in an area. </p>
         <p>Limitation of the results</p>
         <p> Uncertainty is an inevitable component of invasion forecasts ( ) and modelling will
            always contain a level of errors resulting from a wide range of factors ( ), including
            insufficient sample size, measurements errors in the biological survey data or
            insufficient spatial resolution in the mapped environmental variables and impossibility
            or difficulty in integrating critical habitat variables and others factors (e.g.
            competition, dispersion). Hence, the resultant probability map should be used as a
            preliminary data on the potential distribution of <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> in order to identify regions with different probability
            and, consequently, to spot the areas that require more or less intensive monitoring of
            this invasive terrestrial plant species. Thus, important limitations and assumptions in
            the calibration of the model and generating the probability map have to be considered.
            The first is related to the <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence
            inventory dataset. In the present paper, we assume that all areas covered with
               <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence were not included in the
            analysis. However, several inconvenient factors (e.g. large extension of the area or
            inaccessibility in different sites) limited the mapping of all areas covered by
               <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> . We consider that the available datasets
            used to model the probability map were not sufficient to assess with the highest
            accuracy the potential occurrence of A. <tp:taxon-name>fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> . Thus,
            the estimated coefficients in the logistic regression models have associated estimation
            errors, the uncertainty decreasing by mapping more plant occurrence data and predictors
            ( ; ). </p>
         <p> Another limitation refers to the unavailable datasets for the independent variables.
            Thus, the resulted pseudo R2 values indicate that only 24.3% of <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence in the Mures Floodplain Natural Park can be
            influenced by the analysed explanatory factors and the remaining percentage was
            influenced by other factors. Thus, in order to allow a better and realistic modelling of
            species' spreading potential in the future at a much finer scale, more information on
            the spatial distribution of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> combined with
            other predictors (e.g. soil nutrients and heavy metals content, past land-use changes,
            existing plant community) must be integrated. Moreover, the coarse resolution of the
            available soils and depth to water data have also restricted the accuracy of the model.
            One more limitation is related to the final probability map which does not reflect its
            temporal probability. As it is difficult or impossible to model seed dispersal at a
            regional scale ( ), the current results only display the spatial distribution potential
            of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> depending on the analysed explanatory
            factors, without considering the seed dispersal vectors. In addition, environmentally
            suitable sites within the native distributional area may remain free from invasion
            because of biotic interactions, dispersal limitations or historical constraints ( ; ).
            On the other hand, these restrictive factors may, at least in theory, differ or even be
            lacking in invaded areas ( ). As a consequence, it can be appreciated that, in the
            future, the spread might affect more or less other areas indicated by the current
            research. </p>

         <p>Conclusions</p>
         <p> The present study is a geographical approach to assess spatial potential spreading of
            one of the most disturbing invasive terrestrial plant species in Europe (A.
               <tp:taxon-name>fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> ) in one of the most important natural
            protected area in Romania ( Mures Floodplain Natural Park). Cross-referencing the
            scientific findings on the assessment of invasive species in Romania, revealed that the
            present study is one of the first attempts to explain the spatial relationships between
            this invasive terrestrial plant species and its explanatory factors and to assess
            potential distribution, integrating GIS and logistic regression into spatial simulation.
            Thus, the model shows that the explanatory factors of <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> occurrence are varied and have different influences,
            confirming previous findings of scientific literature and other current research on the
            increased tolerance and high adaptation capacity of this invasive species to a variety
            of conditions. The probability map, resulting from plugging the Œ≤ coefficients of the
            logistic regression, indicates that spreading of <tp:taxon-name>A.
               fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> is expected to continue mainly in the areas where
            significant parcels were mapped (close to Pecica, Semlac and Seitin localities), but
            with extension into the eastern and central part of the Park, close to Arad, Felnac,
            Secusigiu and Nadlac localities. This could indicate a future strong adaptation capacity
            of <tp:taxon-name>A. fruticosa</tp:taxon-name> to many terrestrial ecosystems and,
            consequently, a serious threat for the native terrestrial plant species, requiring the
            inclusion of specific measures in the park's management plan. </p>
