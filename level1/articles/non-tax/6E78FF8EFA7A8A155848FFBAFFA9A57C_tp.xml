INTRODUCTION:
Reconstructing the ancestral morphotype from which extant hominoids (apes and humans) evolved is complicated by the mosaic nature of ape evolution, the confounding effects of independently evolved features (homoplasy), and the virtual lack of hylobatids (gibbons and siamangs) in the Miocene fossil record. For several decades, small-bodied anthropoid primates from Africa and Eurasia have not played an important role in this debate, because they generally lack the shared derived features of extant catarrhines (hominoids and Old World monkeys) and are thus considered to precede their divergence. Even some small-bodied catarrhines from Africa (dendropithecids), considered to be stem hominoids by some authors, are viewed as more primitive than the larger-bodied stem ape 
Proconsul
. This has led to the assumption that hylobatids are a dwarfed lineage that evolved from a larger-bodied and more great ape–like common ancestor with hominids (great apes and humans).

RATIONALE:
Here we describe a new genus of small-bodied (4 to 5 kg) ape from the Miocene (11.6 Ma), discovered in the Abocador de Can Mata stratigraphic series (Vallès-Penedès Basin, northeast Iberian Peninsula), that challenges current views on the last common ancestor of extant hominoids. This genus is based on a partial skeleton that enables a reliable reconstruction of cranial morphology and a detailed assessment of elbow and

It exhibits a mosaic of primitive (stem catarrhine–like) and derived (extant hominoid–like) features that forces us to reevaluate the role played by small-bodied catarrhines in ape evolution.

         <p>
RESULTS:
The new genus retains some features that are suggestive of generalized abovebranch quadrupedalism, but it possesses more extensive hominoid-like postcranial features (mostly related to enhanced forearm rotation and ulnar deviation capabilities) than those convergently displayed by atelids. Its overall body plan is more compatible with an emphasis on cautious and eclectic climbing, combined with some degree of below-branch forelimbdominated suspension (although less acrobatic than in extant gibbons).

givorous diet. From a phylogenetic viewpoint, the new genus combines craniodental and postcranial primitive features (similar to those of dendropithecids) with multiple derived cranial and postcranial features shared with extant hominoids. Some cranial similarities with gibbons would support a closer phylogenetic link between the new genus and hylobatids. However, this possibility is not supported by the total evidence. A cladistic analysis based on more than 300 craniodental and postcranial features reveals that the new genus is a stem hominoid (preceding the divergence between hylobatids and hominids), although more derived than previously known small catarrhines and 
Proconsul
.

CONCLUSION:
As the first known Miocene small-bodied catarrhine to share abundant derived features with extant hominoids, the new genus indicates a greater morphological diversity than previously recognized among this heterogeneous group, and it provides key insight into the last common ancestor of hylobatids and hominids. Our cladistic results, coupled with the chronology and location of the new genus, suggest that it represents a late-surviving offshoot of a small African stem hominoid that is more closely related to crown hominoids than 
Proconsul
is. These results suggest that, at least in size and cranial morphology, the last common ancestor of extant hominoids might have been more gibbon-like (less great ape–like) than generally assumed. ▪

Miocene small-bodied anthropoid primates from Africa and Eurasia are generally considered to precede the divergence between the two groups of extant catarrhines—hominoids (apes and humans) and Old World monkeys—and are thus viewed as more primitive than the stem ape 
Proconsul
. Here we describe

         <p>

a small-bodied (4 to 5 kilograms) primate from the Iberian Miocene (11.6 million years ago) that displays a mosaic of primitive characteristics coupled with multiple cranial and postcranial shared derived features of extant hominoids. Our cladistic analyses show that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is a stem hominoid that is more derived than previously described small catarrhines and 
Proconsul
. This forces us to reevaluate the role played by small-bodied catarrhines in ape evolution and provides key insight into the last common ancestor of hylobatids (gibbons) and hominids (great apes and humans).

</p>
         <p>
pes and humans (hominoids) diverged from Old World monkeys (cercopithecoids) by 
A
the Oligocene [
≥
25 million years ago (Ma)] (
1
, 
2
) and subsequently diversified in both Africa and Eurasia during the Miocene (23 to ~5 Ma) (
3
). They are currently represented by crown hominoids (
4
)—i.e., the small-bodied hylobatids (gibbons and siamangs) and the largerbodied hominids (great apes and humans), which diverged from one another by the early Miocene (~17 Ma) (
1
). Reconstructing the ancestral morphotype from which extant apes and humans evolved is a challenging task (
5–7
), given the mosaic nature of evolution (
8
), the confounding effects of independently evolved features (homoplasy) (
5
, 
9
), the conflicting evidence provided by Miocene great apes (
6
, 
9
), and the incomplete and fragmentary nature of the hominoid fossil record [in particular, the virtual lack of fossil gibbons until at least the latest Miocene (
10
, 
11
)]. Thus, although extant hominoids share numerous derived features, particularly in the trunk and forelimb, it is uncertain to what extent these characteristics were inherited from their last common ancestor, whose morphotype is still under discussion (
5
, 
6
, 
11
, 
12
).
</p>
         <p>
The earliest hypotheses postulated a smallbodied gibbon-like ancestor (
13
), and for many
</p>
         <p>
years, fossil small-bodied catarrhines (anthropoid primates from Africa and Eurasia) were considered to be broadly ancestral to gibbons (
14
, 
15
). Today, hylobatids are generally considered to be a specialized and probably dwarfed lineage, evolved from a larger and more great ape–like last common ancestor with hominids (
6
, 
16
). This is because known small-bodied extinct catarrhines, such as the African dendropithecids (including at least 
Dendropithecus
, 
Simiolus
, and 
Micropithecus
) and the Eurasian pliopithecoids (
Pliopithecus
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and allied genera), lack most of the synapomorphies (shared derived features) of crown catarrhines (
17–21
). Even dendropithecids, which are more derived than pliopithecoids and are currently interpreted by some authors as stem hominoids (preceding the hylobatid-hominid divergence) (
3
, 
8
, 
22
), are considered to be more basal than the stem ape 
Proconsul
(
8
, 
21–23
). Here we describe a new Miocene small-bodied ape from Spain, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates cataloniae
</tp:taxon-name>
gen. et sp. nov. (
24
). In some primitive features, this new primate resembles previously known small-bodied catarrhines such as dendropithecids, but it differs from them and from 
Proconsul
by displaying multiple crownhominoid derived features. This mosaic provides key insight into ape evolution by forcing us to reevaluate the role played by small-bodied catarrhines in the emergence of crown hominoids.

Holotype: IPS58443, a partial skeleton with an associated skull (

and movie S1), housed at the ICP. It is composed of 70 bones and bone fragments (table S1) found in close spatial association, which, given the lack of repeated elements, are attributed to a single adult female individual (based on the small canine alveolus), with an estimated body mass of 4 to 5 kg (tables S7 and S8). It includes large portions of the cranium with postcanine maxillary teeth (
Table 1
), a mandibular fragment, a partial left forelimb (nearly complete humerus, radius, partial ulna, carpals, and bones of the manual rays), more fragmentary elements of the right forelimb, and bones from the hind limb.

            <p>Type locality: ACM/C8-A4 (els Hostalets de Pierola, Catalonia, Spain), in the ACM stratigraphic series (Vallès-Penedès Basin, northeast Iberian Peninsula).</p>
            <p>
Age, stratigraphic position, and distribution: Only known from the type locality, which has an estimated age of 11.6 Ma (middle/late Miocene boundary) and is thus somewhat younger than all other ACM hominoid- and pliopithecoid-bearing localities (

Etymology: Genus name from the Latin 
plio-
(itself from the Greek, meaning “greater in extent”) and from the Greek 
bates
(meaning “the one that walks or haunts”). The name is a contraction of the genus names 
Pliopithecus
(“more ape”) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hylobates
</tp:taxon-name>
(“the one that walks in the woods or in the trees”), in allusion to the small body size and the mosaic of primitive (stem catarrhine–like) and derived (crown hominoid) features displayed by the new taxon. The species epithet is the genitive of the female substantive “Catalonia,” the Latin name of Catalunya (in which the type locality is situated).

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>Small-bodied catarrhine primate (estimated female BM of 4 to 5 kg). Dental formula 2.1.2.3.</p>
            <p>Female upper canines moderately compressed. Upper cheek teeth low-crowned and with subpyramidal, moderately peripheral, and inflated cusps. Upper premolars relatively broad and ovoid, P4 smaller than P3, both with heteromorphic cusps, a markedly convex lingual contour and a distinct lingual cingulum (more developed in the P4), a distinct transverse crest separating the restricted mesial fovea from the extensive trigon basin, and the postparacrista forming an abrupt angle with the distal marginal ridge. Upper molars only moderately broader than long, with markedly convex lingual profiles; buccal cusps quite peripheral and buccal cingula discontinuous; lingual cingula relatively well developed, shelf-like, and C-shaped, but not surrounding the hypocone (which is distinct and more peripheral than the protocone); mesial fovea restricted, with an obliquely directed preprotocrista, and trigon basin extensive, being separated by a continuous crista obliqua from the slightly smaller distal fovea, which displays no hypocone-metacone crest. M2 slightly larger than the M1, and M3 shorter and trapezoidal (due to the oblique buccal margin, with a centrally situated metacone and a rudimentary hypocone).</p>
            <p>Face small but with a distinct snout, the anterior portion of the nasals being almost parallel to the palate. Maxillary sinus large and frontal sinus present but small. Nasal aperture narrow. Nasoalveolar clivus short, with an open palatine fenestra. Anteriorly slightly narrow palate with somewhat convergent upper tooth rows. Zygomatic root moderately high. Orbits subcircular, large, and frontated, with telescopic orbital rims located over the P4. Estimated cranial capacity (69 to 75 cm3) indicating a monkey-like degree of encephalization. External auditory meatus tubular but short and not completely ossified, with a V-shaped end and its anterior portion fused with the postglenoid process. Carotid foramen perforating the bulla posterodistally, and carotid canal horizontally and anteriorly oriented. Spinosum and postglenoid foramina absent. Jugular foramen large and ventrally visible.</p>
            <p>Humerus without entepicondylar foramen and capitular tail, with a well-developed capitulum, and a narrow and deep zona conoidea.Radial head rounded and not very tilted, with a markedly beveled surface for articulation with the humeral zona conoidea, the articular surface for the ulnar radial notch extending along a large portion of the radial head, and a laterally facing bicipital tuberosity. Distal radioulnar joint fully diarthrodial, with an expanded and two-faceted semilunar articulation on the ulnar head, and a partially developed ulnar fovea. Ulnar styloid process with reduced girth and not articulating with the short pisiform. Triquetrum small and with a reduced articular surface for the ulnar styloid process. Hamate relatively long proximodistally, with a steep triquetrum facet, a relatively large head and a distally projecting hamulus. Capitate with a relatively small and oblong head and a divided facet for the second metacarpal on its radial side.</p>
            <p>
Differential diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
The new taxon differs from pliopithecoids and dendropithecids in its lack of a humeral capitular tail, its hominoid-like proximal radial morphology, its expanded ulnar head with a two-faceted semilunar articulation, and its partially developed ulnar fovea. It further differs from these taxa and proconsulids in its more hominoid-like carpal morphology (including the lack of a pisiform facet for the styloid process, a capitate facet for the second metacarpal divided by a deep ligamentary notch, and a distally projecting hamulus in the hamate), and particularly from pliopithecoids in its overall larger muzzle, more horizontal nasals anteriorly, some details of the upper molars, and (at least compared with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
) the lack of an entepicondylar foramen in the humerus. It also differs from all of the above-mentioned taxa in its fused ectotympanic and postglenoid process, and from these taxa and hominids in its horizontal and anteriorly oriented carotid canal. Last, it differs from crown hominoids (hylobatids and hominids) in its incompletely ossified ectotympanic and in its more primitive dentition and forelimb morphology (particularly in the humeroulnar articulation).

Description, comparisons, and paleobiology 
Dental morphology and diet


</p>
            <p>
Although the lack of lower dentition precludes comparisons with some taxa, the upper cheek teeth of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
(

D and 
Table 1
) generally resemble those of other small-bodied Miocene catarrhines in both occlusal morphology and proportions (figs. S1 and S2). In contrast, they display a more primitive morphology than those of extant hominoids, including the similarly sized gibbons. Hylobatids possess more elongated cheek teeth with more peripheralized cusps, less developed cingula, and a much more extensive central fovea. Compared with Miocene small-bodied catarrhines from Eurasia and Africa (fig. S1), the upper molars of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
more closely resemble those of the dendropithecid 
Micropithecus
(
21
, 
34
, 
35
, 
79
) in several features, such as the markedly convex lingual profiles and moderately developed buccal cingula (albeit to a lesser extent than in 
Micropithecus
), the C-shaped lingual cingulum that is mostly restricted to the protocone (not surrounding the hypocone), the well-developed and lingually situated hypocone, and the relatively narrow M1 and M2. Nevertheless, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
differs in several features from 
Micropithecus
, which has more restricted buccal cingula, a hypocone-metacone crest, and a relatively longer and less trapezoidal M3. The dentition of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
more clearly differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
and other pliopithecoids (fig. S1), including from 
Barberapithecus
[also recorded at the Vallès-Penedès Basin (
36
)] and 
Pliopithecus
[previously recorded at ACM (
33
)] in several features, such as the more convex lingual profile, the more peripheral buccal cusps, the less developed cingula of the molars, the narrower M1 and M2, and the M3 occlusal morphology and proportions (fig. S2).

            <p>
With regard to microwear features, the M1 displays a pitting percentage of 30.0%, a pit breadth of 5.67 μm, and a striation breadth of 1.98 μm. Based on pitting incidence (

, A and B), which is the most useful metric for distinguishing among dietary categories (
70
), 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
closely resembles extant frugivores (
<tp:taxon-name>
Pan troglodytes
</tp:taxon-name>
) and eclectic feeders (
<tp:taxon-name>
Papio cynocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
) that largely rely on ripe fruit. In contrast, the pitting incidence of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is higher than in extant folivores and much lower than in extant hard-object feeders (including orangutans). Compared with other extinct catarrhines from Western Europe, the pitting percentage of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is somewhat lower than in most pliopithecoids and hominoids, for which some degree of sclerocarpy has been inferred (
66
, 
68
). This low pitting incidence is consistent with the pit- and striation-breadth measurements (which show no sign of extreme folivory or specialized hard-object feeding) and most closely approaches that of the fossil hominoids 
Anoiapithecus brevirostris
and 
Hispanopithecus laietanus
, previously interpreted as soft frugivores (
68
). These results are confirmed by a multivariate analysis that simultaneously examined the three microwear variables (

C and tables S9 to S11), in which 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
falls closer to the extant frugivorous–mixed-feeder centroid for the first and second canonical axes and is classified as a frugivore. Dental microwear analyses therefore indicate a mainly frugivorous diet for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
, compatible with a high consumption of ripe fruit and a low sclerocarpic component.

            <p>
Body mass

</p>
            <p>
Dental BM estimates for the female holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
(table S7) range from 2.9 to 4.8 kg, with an average BM estimate of 3.9 kg and an uncertainty degree (based on the combined 95% confidence intervals for each dental locus) of 2.5 to 5.7 kg. Postcranial BM estimates (table S8) are on average 4.8 kg (range: 4.0 to 5.6 kg), based on catarrhine regressions, and 4.3 kg (range: 2.6 to 6.3 kg), based on hominoid regressions (estimates for each postcranial estimator and their confidence intervals are given in table S8). Given that the size of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is in the lower range for extant hominoids, the catarrhine regressions probably yield more accurate estimates, although the hominoid-based estimates are closer to the dental ones. Overall, the body mass of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates cataloniae
</tp:taxon-name>
can be estimated at ~4 to 5 kg (much lower than that estimated for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus vindobonensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, ~11 to 12 kg; table S8).

Cranial morphology and encephalization

</p>
            <p>
A 3D virtual reconstruction of the cranium, based on the preserved specimens, is shown in fig. S3, whereas the final reconstruction (including mirrored portions) is shown in 

and movie S1. Based on this reconstruction, the cranium of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
differs from the primitive catarrhine condition (
22
, 
37
, 
60
) by being short, wide, and high. However, the tubular ectotympanic is short and incompletely ossified—i.e., less developed than in 
Saadanius
and extant crown catarrhines (
20–22
). The maxillary sinus is extensive, as in stem catarrhines and hominoids (
22
, 
80
), and there is also a small frontal sinus, as in stem hominoids but unlike in stem catarrhines, cercopithecoids, hylobatids, and pongines (
22
, 
37
, 
80
). The face is short and displays anteriorly situated orbits, as in hylobatids, colobines, and some extinct small-bodied catarrhines such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
Micropithecus
, and 
Lomorupithecus
(
19
, 
21
, 
38
, 
76
, 
79
). However, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
differs from these taxa (and more closely resembles hylobatids) by displaying a more well-defined muzzle (especially compared with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
) with long and more horizontal nasals, a higher zygomatic root (moderately high as in hylobatids, but less so than in hominids), an interorbital pillar nearly orthogonal to the frontal squama (as in hylobatids and chimpanzees), a high degree of orbital convergence and frontation (as in all extant hominoids), and thin and anteriorly projecting (telescopic) orbital rims [to a greater extent than in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
38
), and thus most closely resembling hylobatids and, as far as it can be ascertained with incomplete preservation, 
Micropithecus
(
79
)]. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
also displays derived hominoid features in the basicranium (

A), including the absence of a postglenoid foramen with a large and ventrally visible jugular foramen (as in all extant hominoids), the foramen ovale situated anteriorly and laterally to the Eusta- chian aperture (as in hylobatids and African and African apes), and the horizontal and anapes), the fusion between the auditory meatus teriorly directed carotid canal in the petrosal bone and the postglenoid process (as in hylobatids (as in hylobatids).

Braincase measurements yield an average cranial capacity estimate of 69.0 cm3 (range: 41.4 to 110.7 cm 3; table S12), which is close to the estimates of 60.1 and 65.3 cm3 delivered by the two most reliable estimators (

) and only slightly lower than the estimate of 75.1 cm3 obtained from foramen magnum area (table S12). According to our estimates of body mass (4.5 kg) and cranial capacity [72 cm3 (average of cranial and foramen magnum estimates)], 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
would display a monkey-like degree of encephalization extensively overlapping with extant cercopithecoids (fig. S4 and table S13), being much more encephalized than the stem catarrhine 
Aegyptopithecus
, slightly more so than the stem cercopithecoid 
Victoriapithecus
, and only slightly less so than hylobatids and the extinct hominoids 
Proconsul
and 
Oreopithecus
. All these taxa, like cercopithecoids, are less encephalized than the extinct hominoid 
Hispanopithecus
(
Rudapithecus
) and the extant great apes. Although humans are outliers in brain size–body size allometric regressions, great apes further display an allometric grade shift compared with hylobatids (and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
), which are only slightly more encephalized on average than cercopithecoids (
58
).

Postcranial morphology and locomotion

</p>
            <p>
The humerus (

) resembles that of extant crown catarrhines, proconsulids, and dendropithecids by lacking (unlike 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
) an entepicondylar foramen (
17
, 
20
, 
21
, 
38
, 
79
, 
81
, 
82
). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
more closely resembles extant hominoids in the laterally facing bicipital tuberosity in the radius (
81
, 
83
) (

), as well as in the configuration of the humeroradial articulation (
81
, 
82
, 
84
) (

), including: in the humerus, the lack of capitular tail [present in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
, dendropithecids, and cercopithecoids (
84
)] and the moderately globulous (although not posterolaterally expanded) capitulum with a well-developed zona conoidea [lacking in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
and dendropithecids (
81–84
)]; and, in the radius, the only slightly tilted and almost circular radial head with a small and flat area, a reduced lateral lip, and a beveled surface for the humeral zona conoidea. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
also has a hominoid-like diarthrodial distal radioulnar joint (
85–87
), with a two-faceted expanded semilunar articulation in the ulnar head (

). In this regard, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
departs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
, dendropithecids, and cercopithecoids (
17
, 
38
, 
82
) and more closely resembles 
Proconsul
(
88
), although the ulnar head is less extensive than in extant hominoids. In contrast with these derived features, the humeral shaft and humeroulnar joint are plesiomorphic: The former (

) is anteriorly straight and somewhat proximally retroflexed; the latter (

) lacks the stabilizing features of extant hominoids (
83
, 
89
), as shown by the narrow ulnar trochlear notch without a median keel (in agreement with the absence of spooling and the poorly defined trochlear lateral keel in the humerus of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
).
</p>
            <p>
Humeral torsion in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is estimated at 101°, irrespective of the method employed (based on the posterior buttress for the humeral head or the bisector of the bicipital groove), with a confidence interval spanning 95.7° to 106.3° [based on the prediction error (5.23%) for the bicipital groove method (
50
)]. This degree of torsion is moderate, higher than that estimated for 
Proconsul heseloni
(92°), but comparable to estimates for 
Dryopithecus fontani
(102°) and 
Dendropithecus macinnesi
(103.5°), and only slightly below the value estimated for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus vindobonensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(109°). The humeral torsion of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is thus most comparable to that of non-atelid platyrrhines and lower than that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ateles
</tp:taxon-name>
and extant hominoids, especially African great apes and humans [although the high degree of humeral torsion of extant hominoids is related to increased mobility at the glenohumeral joint, the higher values of great apes and humans appear related to knucklewalking and enhanced manipulation, respectively, rather than suspensory behaviors (
50
)]. In contrast to the moderate humeral torsion, the forelimb of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
appears somewhat elongated relative to its body size (fig. S5). Allometric computations of relative forelimb length in fossils (residuals are given in table S14) must be considered with caution, because they are dependent on the accuracy of body-size estimates. However, the forelimb of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
(based on our BM estimate of 4.5 kg) appears more elongated than that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
(based on our estimate of 11.5 kg). The latter taxon, contrary to previous assertions (
81
, 
83
), has the generalized proportions of quadrupedal monkeys. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
, in contrast, has a forelimb elongation similar to that of female orangutans and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Brachyteles
</tp:taxon-name>
, although it is less extreme than in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ateles
</tp:taxon-name>
and especially than in hylobatids. The same pattern holds when the humerus and radius are analyzed separately, although in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
, relative length is somewhat higher for the radius than for the humerus. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
further displays a high arm angle (8°), which is considerably greater than the average in most anthropoids, except 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hylobates
</tp:taxon-name>
(9.8°), 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pongo
</tp:taxon-name>
(6.3°), and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ateles
</tp:taxon-name>
(6.5°) (
51
).
</p>
            <p>
The ulnocarpal articulation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is completely different from that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
and dendropithecids (
17
, 
38
, 
90
), including a partially developed ulnar fovea (

), which, in extant hominoids, is the attachment area of the triangular disc ligament and the intra-articular meniscus (
85–87
). The ulnar styloid process is relatively long and slender, with no discernible articular surfaces for the pisiform or triquetrum. This agrees with the lack of an articular facet for the styloid process on the pisiform, like extant hominoids but unlike monkeys and 
Proconsul
(
91
). However, in contrast to 
Pierolapithecus
(
92
), the triquetrum of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
shows a proximal articular facet, which is more developed than that present in hylobatids and sometimes 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pan
</tp:taxon-name>
(
51
, 
87
) but less developed than in monkeys. This suggests that ulnotriquetral contact might have been reduced by some kind of intra-articular tissue, similarly to some 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ateles
</tp:taxon-name>
species (
93
). Moreover, as in apes, the triquetrum of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is small relative to hamate size (fig. S6), indicating a reduced loading on the ulnar side of the wrist. However, as in monkeys and 
Proconsul
, the triquetrum of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
differs from that of extant apes and 
Pierolapithecus
(
92
) by possessing a proximally protruding beak-like process (

). The hamate of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is “Miocene ape– like” (
91
, 
92
), although it more closely resembles that of hylobatids by possessing a dorsopalmarly narrow and proximodistally long triquetral articular surface that is proximally globular, as well as a distally projecting hamulus (

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
further resembles hylobatids and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ateles
</tp:taxon-name>
by having an oblong and mediolaterally narrow capitate head that, like the facet for the hamate, is proximodistally aligned. This morphology contrasts with the more globulous, wider, and ulnarly inclined capitate head of other catarrhines, including 
Proconsul
(
88
, 
91
) and 
Pierolapithecus
(
92
); in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
, though, it is not radially inclined, as it is in hylobatids. Moreover, the capitate facet for the second metacarpal is divided by a deep ligamentary notch (

), as in extant hominoids and 
Pierolapithecus
(
92
) but not in other catarrhines (including 
Proconsul
), in which the facet for the second metacarpal is dorsopalmarly continuous and occupies the whole lateral aspect of the capitate (

) (
91
). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
has a complex articulation between the third metacarpal and capitate, as in extant apes but not in 
Proconsul
(
91
); however, as in 
Pierolapithecus
(
92
), the capitate of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
lacks a hook-like process.
</p>
            <p>
Regarding positional behaviors, although the primitive morphology of the proximal humerus of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is suggestive of generalized abovebranch quadrupedalism (
94
), its overall postcranial body plan is more compatible with a locomotor repertoire that includes a large amount of cautious and eclectic climbing (
87
, 
95
). This inference is supported by the emphasis on pronation and supination capabilities, the reduced compressive forces transferred across the ulnar side of the wrist, and the important ulnar deviation and rotatory capabilities. It agrees with previous hypotheses on the original locomotor adaptations of hominoids (
95
, 
96
) and with recent interpretations of 
Proconsul
that similarly depict this taxon as an arboreal quadruped with adaptations for cautious climbing and clambering (
12
, 
88
), including an incipient distal radioulnar diarthrosis that (unlike in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
) is still associated to a nonretreated ulnar styloid process (
88
). The reduced ulnocarpal articulation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
thus more closely foreshadows the condition of extant hominoids, although to a lesser extent than in the stem great ape 
Pierolapithecus
(
92
), indicating a decreased emphasis on forearm use under weight-bearing conditions relative to 
Proconsul
(
88
). Several characteristics of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
(particularly the elongated forearm, the high arm angle, and the laterally facing bicipital tuberosity) further suggest some degree of below-branch forelimbdominated suspensory behaviors (
51
). However, the lack of hominoid-like elbow-stabilizing features in the humeroulnar joint (
83
, 
89
), the generalized metacarpophalangeal proportions, and the lack of marked phalangeal curvature suggest that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
was not specifically adapted to perform the acrobatic suspensory behaviors (ricochetal brachiation) displayed by extant gibbons.

Holotype: IPS58443, a partial skeleton with an associated skull (

and movie S1), housed at the ICP. It is composed of 70 bones and bone fragments (table S1) found in close spatial association, which, given the lack of repeated elements, are attributed to a single adult female individual (based on the small canine alveolus), with an estimated body mass of 4 to 5 kg (tables S7 and S8). It includes large portions of the cranium with postcanine maxillary teeth (
Table 1
), a mandibular fragment, a partial left forelimb (nearly complete humerus, radius, partial ulna, carpals, and bones of the manual rays), more fragmentary elements of the right forelimb, and bones from the hind limb.

Age, stratigraphic position, and distribution: Only known from the type locality, which has an estimated age of 11.6 Ma (middle/late Miocene boundary) and is thus somewhat younger than all other ACM hominoid- and pliopithecoid-bearing localities (

Etymology: Genus name from the Latin 
plio-
(itself from the Greek, meaning “greater in extent”) and from the Greek 
bates
(meaning “the one that walks or haunts”). The name is a contraction of the genus names 
Pliopithecus
(“more ape”) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hylobates
</tp:taxon-name>
(“the one that walks in the woods or in the trees”), in allusion to the small body size and the mosaic of primitive (stem catarrhine–like) and derived (crown hominoid) features displayed by the new taxon. The species epithet is the genitive of the female substantive “Catalonia,” the Latin name of Catalunya (in which the type locality is situated).

Diagnosis

</p>
            <p>Small-bodied catarrhine primate (estimated female BM of 4 to 5 kg). Dental formula 2.1.2.3.</p>
            <p>Female upper canines moderately compressed. Upper cheek teeth low-crowned and with subpyramidal, moderately peripheral, and inflated cusps. Upper premolars relatively broad and ovoid, P4 smaller than P3, both with heteromorphic cusps, a markedly convex lingual contour and a distinct lingual cingulum (more developed in the P4), a distinct transverse crest separating the restricted mesial fovea from the extensive trigon basin, and the postparacrista forming an abrupt angle with the distal marginal ridge. Upper molars only moderately broader than long, with markedly convex lingual profiles; buccal cusps quite peripheral and buccal cingula discontinuous; lingual cingula relatively well developed, shelf-like, and C-shaped, but not surrounding the hypocone (which is distinct and more peripheral than the protocone); mesial fovea restricted, with an obliquely directed preprotocrista, and trigon basin extensive, being separated by a continuous crista obliqua from the slightly smaller distal fovea, which displays no hypocone-metacone crest. M2 slightly larger than the M1, and M3 shorter and trapezoidal (due to the oblique buccal margin, with a centrally situated metacone and a rudimentary hypocone).</p>
            <p>Face small but with a distinct snout, the anterior portion of the nasals being almost parallel to the palate. Maxillary sinus large and frontal sinus present but small. Nasal aperture narrow. Nasoalveolar clivus short, with an open palatine fenestra. Anteriorly slightly narrow palate with somewhat convergent upper tooth rows. Zygomatic root moderately high. Orbits subcircular, large, and frontated, with telescopic orbital rims located over the P4. Estimated cranial capacity (69 to 75 cm3) indicating a monkey-like degree of encephalization. External auditory meatus tubular but short and not completely ossified, with a V-shaped end and its anterior portion fused with the postglenoid process. Carotid foramen perforating the bulla posterodistally, and carotid canal horizontally and anteriorly oriented. Spinosum and postglenoid foramina absent. Jugular foramen large and ventrally visible.</p>
            <p>Humerus without entepicondylar foramen and capitular tail, with a well-developed capitulum, and a narrow and deep zona conoidea.Radial head rounded and not very tilted, with a markedly beveled surface for articulation with the humeral zona conoidea, the articular surface for the ulnar radial notch extending along a large portion of the radial head, and a laterally facing bicipital tuberosity. Distal radioulnar joint fully diarthrodial, with an expanded and two-faceted semilunar articulation on the ulnar head, and a partially developed ulnar fovea. Ulnar styloid process with reduced girth and not articulating with the short pisiform. Triquetrum small and with a reduced articular surface for the ulnar styloid process. Hamate relatively long proximodistally, with a steep triquetrum facet, a relatively large head and a distally projecting hamulus. Capitate with a relatively small and oblong head and a divided facet for the second metacarpal on its radial side.</p>
            <p>
Differential diagnosis

</p>
            <p>
The new taxon differs from pliopithecoids and dendropithecids in its lack of a humeral capitular tail, its hominoid-like proximal radial morphology, its expanded ulnar head with a two-faceted semilunar articulation, and its partially developed ulnar fovea. It further differs from these taxa and proconsulids in its more hominoid-like carpal morphology (including the lack of a pisiform facet for the styloid process, a capitate facet for the second metacarpal divided by a deep ligamentary notch, and a distally projecting hamulus in the hamate), and particularly from pliopithecoids in its overall larger muzzle, more horizontal nasals anteriorly, some details of the upper molars, and (at least compared with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
) the lack of an entepicondylar foramen in the humerus. It also differs from all of the above-mentioned taxa in its fused ectotympanic and postglenoid process, and from these taxa and hominids in its horizontal and anteriorly oriented carotid canal. Last, it differs from crown hominoids (hylobatids and hominids) in its incompletely ossified ectotympanic and in its more primitive dentition and forelimb morphology (particularly in the humeroulnar articulation).

Description, comparisons, and paleobiology 
Dental morphology and diet


</p>
            <p>
Although the lack of lower dentition precludes comparisons with some taxa, the upper cheek teeth of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
(

D and 
Table 1
) generally resemble those of other small-bodied Miocene catarrhines in both occlusal morphology and proportions (figs. S1 and S2). In contrast, they display a more primitive morphology than those of extant hominoids, including the similarly sized gibbons. Hylobatids possess more elongated cheek teeth with more peripheralized cusps, less developed cingula, and a much more extensive central fovea. Compared with Miocene small-bodied catarrhines from Eurasia and Africa (fig. S1), the upper molars of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
more closely resemble those of the dendropithecid 
Micropithecus
(
21
, 
34
, 
35
, 
79
) in several features, such as the markedly convex lingual profiles and moderately developed buccal cingula (albeit to a lesser extent than in 
Micropithecus
), the C-shaped lingual cingulum that is mostly restricted to the protocone (not surrounding the hypocone), the well-developed and lingually situated hypocone, and the relatively narrow M1 and M2. Nevertheless, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
differs in several features from 
Micropithecus
, which has more restricted buccal cingula, a hypocone-metacone crest, and a relatively longer and less trapezoidal M3. The dentition of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
more clearly differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
and other pliopithecoids (fig. S1), including from 
Barberapithecus
[also recorded at the Vallès-Penedès Basin (
36
)] and 
Pliopithecus
[previously recorded at ACM (
33
)] in several features, such as the more convex lingual profile, the more peripheral buccal cusps, the less developed cingula of the molars, the narrower M1 and M2, and the M3 occlusal morphology and proportions (fig. S2).

            <p>
With regard to microwear features, the M1 displays a pitting percentage of 30.0%, a pit breadth of 5.67 μm, and a striation breadth of 1.98 μm. Based on pitting incidence (

, A and B), which is the most useful metric for distinguishing among dietary categories (
70
), 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
closely resembles extant frugivores (
<tp:taxon-name>
Pan troglodytes
</tp:taxon-name>
) and eclectic feeders (
<tp:taxon-name>
Papio cynocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
) that largely rely on ripe fruit. In contrast, the pitting incidence of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is higher than in extant folivores and much lower than in extant hard-object feeders (including orangutans). Compared with other extinct catarrhines from Western Europe, the pitting percentage of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is somewhat lower than in most pliopithecoids and hominoids, for which some degree of sclerocarpy has been inferred (
66
, 
68
). This low pitting incidence is consistent with the pit- and striation-breadth measurements (which show no sign of extreme folivory or specialized hard-object feeding) and most closely approaches that of the fossil hominoids 
Anoiapithecus brevirostris
and 
Hispanopithecus laietanus
, previously interpreted as soft frugivores (
68
). These results are confirmed by a multivariate analysis that simultaneously examined the three microwear variables (

C and tables S9 to S11), in which 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
falls closer to the extant frugivorous–mixed-feeder centroid for the first and second canonical axes and is classified as a frugivore. Dental microwear analyses therefore indicate a mainly frugivorous diet for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
, compatible with a high consumption of ripe fruit and a low sclerocarpic component.

            <p>
Body mass

</p>
            <p>
Dental BM estimates for the female holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
(table S7) range from 2.9 to 4.8 kg, with an average BM estimate of 3.9 kg and an uncertainty degree (based on the combined 95% confidence intervals for each dental locus) of 2.5 to 5.7 kg. Postcranial BM estimates (table S8) are on average 4.8 kg (range: 4.0 to 5.6 kg), based on catarrhine regressions, and 4.3 kg (range: 2.6 to 6.3 kg), based on hominoid regressions (estimates for each postcranial estimator and their confidence intervals are given in table S8). Given that the size of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is in the lower range for extant hominoids, the catarrhine regressions probably yield more accurate estimates, although the hominoid-based estimates are closer to the dental ones. Overall, the body mass of the holotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates cataloniae
</tp:taxon-name>
can be estimated at ~4 to 5 kg (much lower than that estimated for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus vindobonensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, ~11 to 12 kg; table S8).

Cranial morphology and encephalization

</p>
            <p>
A 3D virtual reconstruction of the cranium, based on the preserved specimens, is shown in fig. S3, whereas the final reconstruction (including mirrored portions) is shown in 

and movie S1. Based on this reconstruction, the cranium of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
differs from the primitive catarrhine condition (
22
, 
37
, 
60
) by being short, wide, and high. However, the tubular ectotympanic is short and incompletely ossified—i.e., less developed than in 
Saadanius
and extant crown catarrhines (
20–22
). The maxillary sinus is extensive, as in stem catarrhines and hominoids (
22
, 
80
), and there is also a small frontal sinus, as in stem hominoids but unlike in stem catarrhines, cercopithecoids, hylobatids, and pongines (
22
, 
37
, 
80
). The face is short and displays anteriorly situated orbits, as in hylobatids, colobines, and some extinct small-bodied catarrhines such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
Micropithecus
, and 
Lomorupithecus
(
19
, 
21
, 
38
, 
76
, 
79
). However, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
differs from these taxa (and more closely resembles hylobatids) by displaying a more well-defined muzzle (especially compared with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
) with long and more horizontal nasals, a higher zygomatic root (moderately high as in hylobatids, but less so than in hominids), an interorbital pillar nearly orthogonal to the frontal squama (as in hylobatids and chimpanzees), a high degree of orbital convergence and frontation (as in all extant hominoids), and thin and anteriorly projecting (telescopic) orbital rims [to a greater extent than in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
38
), and thus most closely resembling hylobatids and, as far as it can be ascertained with incomplete preservation, 
Micropithecus
(
79
)]. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates

also displays derived hominoid features in the basicranium (

A), including the absence of a postglenoid foramen with a large and ventrally visible jugular foramen (as in all extant hominoids), the foramen ovale situated anteriorly and laterally to the Eusta- chian aperture (as in hylobatids and African and African apes), and the horizontal and anapes), the fusion between the auditory meatus teriorly directed carotid canal in the petrosal bone and the postglenoid process (as in hylobatids (as in hylobatids).

Braincase measurements yield an average cranial capacity estimate of 69.0 cm3 (range: 41.4 to 110.7 cm 3; table S12), which is close to the estimates of 60.1 and 65.3 cm3 delivered by the two most reliable estimators (
57
) and only slightly lower than the estimate of 75.1 cm3 obtained from foramen magnum area (table S12). According to our estimates of body mass (4.5 kg) and cranial capacity [72 cm3 (average of cranial and foramen magnum estimates)], 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
would display a monkey-like degree of encephalization extensively overlapping with extant cercopithecoids (fig. S4 and table S13), being much more encephalized than the stem catarrhine 
Aegyptopithecus
, slightly more so than the stem cercopithecoid 
Victoriapithecus
, and only slightly less so than hylobatids and the extinct hominoids 
Proconsul
and 
Oreopithecus
. All these taxa, like cercopithecoids, are less encephalized than the extinct hominoid 
Hispanopithecus
(
Rudapithecus
) and the extant great apes. Although humans are outliers in brain size–body size allometric regressions, great apes further display an allometric grade shift compared with hylobatids (and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
), which are only slightly more encephalized on average than cercopithecoids (

Postcranial morphology and locomotion

</p>
            <p>
The humerus (

) resembles that of extant crown catarrhines, proconsulids, and dendropithecids by lacking (unlike 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
) an entepicondylar foramen (
17
, 
20
, 
21
, 
38
, 
79
, 
81
, 
82
). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
more closely resembles extant hominoids in the laterally facing bicipital tuberosity in the radius (
81
, 
83
) (

), as well as in the configuration of the humeroradial articulation (
81
, 
82
, 
84
) (

), including: in the humerus, the lack of capitular tail [present in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
, dendropithecids, and cercopithecoids (
84
)] and the moderately globulous (although not posterolaterally expanded) capitulum with a well-developed zona conoidea [lacking in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
and dendropithecids (
81–84
)]; and, in the radius, the only slightly tilted and almost circular radial head with a small and flat area, a reduced lateral lip, and a beveled surface for the humeral zona conoidea. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
also has a hominoid-like diarthrodial distal radioulnar joint (
85–87
), with a two-faceted expanded semilunar articulation in the ulnar head (

). In this regard, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
departs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
, dendropithecids, and cercopithecoids (
17
, 
38
, 
82
) and more closely resembles 
Proconsul
(
88
), although the ulnar head is less extensive than in extant hominoids. In contrast with these derived features, the humeral shaft and humeroulnar joint are plesiomorphic: The former (

) is anteriorly straight and somewhat proximally retroflexed; the latter (

) lacks the stabilizing features of extant hominoids (
83
, 
89
), as shown by the narrow ulnar trochlear notch without a median keel (in agreement with the absence of spooling and the poorly defined trochlear lateral keel in the humerus of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
).
</p>
            <p>
Humeral torsion in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is estimated at 101°, irrespective of the method employed (based on the posterior buttress for the humeral head or the bisector of the bicipital groove), with a confidence interval spanning 95.7° to 106.3° [based on the prediction error (5.23%) for the bicipital groove method (
50
)]. This degree of torsion is moderate, higher than that estimated for 
Proconsul heseloni
(92°), but comparable to estimates for 
Dryopithecus fontani
(102°) and 
Dendropithecus macinnesi
(103.5°), and only slightly below the value estimated for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus vindobonensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(109°). The humeral torsion of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is thus most comparable to that of non-atelid platyrrhines and lower than that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ateles
</tp:taxon-name>
and extant hominoids, especially African great apes and humans [although the high degree of humeral torsion of extant hominoids is related to increased mobility at the glenohumeral joint, the higher values of great apes and humans appear related to knucklewalking and enhanced manipulation, respectively, rather than suspensory behaviors (
50
)]. In contrast to the moderate humeral torsion, the forelimb of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
appears somewhat elongated relative to its body size (fig. S5). Allometric computations of relative forelimb length in fossils (residuals are given in table S14) must be considered with caution, because they are dependent on the accuracy of body-size estimates. However, the forelimb of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
(based on our BM estimate of 4.5 kg) appears more elongated than that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
(based on our estimate of 11.5 kg). The latter taxon, contrary to previous assertions (
81
, 
83
), has the generalized proportions of quadrupedal monkeys. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
, in contrast, has a forelimb elongation similar to that of female orangutans and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Brachyteles
</tp:taxon-name>
, although it is less extreme than in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ateles
</tp:taxon-name>
and especially than in hylobatids. The same pattern holds when the humerus and radius are analyzed separately, although in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
, relative length is somewhat higher for the radius than for the humerus. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
further displays a high arm angle (8°), which is considerably greater than the average in most anthropoids, except 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hylobates
</tp:taxon-name>
(9.8°), 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pongo
</tp:taxon-name>
(6.3°), and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ateles
</tp:taxon-name>
(6.5°) (
51
).
</p>
            <p>
The ulnocarpal articulation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is completely different from that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
and dendropithecids (
17
, 
38
, 
90
), including a partially developed ulnar fovea (

), which, in extant hominoids, is the attachment area of the triangular disc ligament and the intra-articular meniscus (
85–87
). The ulnar styloid process is relatively long and slender, with no discernible articular surfaces for the pisiform or triquetrum. This agrees with the lack of an articular facet for the styloid process on the pisiform, like extant hominoids but unlike monkeys and 
Proconsul
(
91
). However, in contrast to 
Pierolapithecus
(
92
), the triquetrum of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
shows a proximal articular facet, which is more developed than that present in hylobatids and sometimes 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pan
</tp:taxon-name>
(
51
, 
87
) but less developed than in monkeys. This suggests that ulnotriquetral contact might have been reduced by some kind of intra-articular tissue, similarly to some 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ateles
</tp:taxon-name>
species (
93
). Moreover, as in apes, the triquetrum of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is small relative to hamate size (fig. S6), indicating a reduced loading on the ulnar side of the wrist. However, as in monkeys and 
Proconsul
, the triquetrum of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
differs from that of extant apes and 
Pierolapithecus
(
92
) by possessing a proximally protruding beak-like process (

). The hamate of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is “Miocene ape– like” (
91
, 
92
), although it more closely resembles that of hylobatids by possessing a dorsopalmarly narrow and proximodistally long triquetral articular surface that is proximally globular, as well as a distally projecting hamulus (

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
further resembles hylobatids and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ateles
</tp:taxon-name>
by having an oblong and mediolaterally narrow capitate head that, like the facet for the hamate, is proximodistally aligned. This morphology contrasts with the more globulous, wider, and ulnarly inclined capitate head of other catarrhines, including 
Proconsul
(
88
, 
91
) and 
Pierolapithecus
(
92
); in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
, though, it is not radially inclined, as it is in hylobatids. Moreover, the capitate facet for the second metacarpal is divided by a deep ligamentary notch (

), as in extant hominoids and 
Pierolapithecus
(
92
) but not in other catarrhines (including 
Proconsul
), in which the facet for the second metacarpal is dorsopalmarly continuous and occupies the whole lateral aspect of the capitate (

) (
91
). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
has a complex articulation between the third metacarpal and capitate, as in extant apes but not in 
Proconsul
(
91
); however, as in 
Pierolapithecus
(
92
), the capitate of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
lacks a hook-like process.
</p>
            <p>
Regarding positional behaviors, although the primitive morphology of the proximal humerus of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is suggestive of generalized abovebranch quadrupedalism (
94
), its overall postcranial body plan is more compatible with a locomotor repertoire that includes a large amount of cautious and eclectic climbing (
87
, 
95
). This inference is supported by the emphasis on pronation and supination capabilities, the reduced compressive forces transferred across the ulnar side of the wrist, and the important ulnar deviation and rotatory capabilities. It agrees with previous hypotheses on the original locomotor adaptations of hominoids (
95
, 
96
) and with recent interpretations of 
Proconsul
that similarly depict this taxon as an arboreal quadruped with adaptations for cautious climbing and clambering (
12
, 
88
), including an incipient distal radioulnar diarthrosis that (unlike in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
) is still associated to a nonretreated ulnar styloid process (
88
). The reduced ulnocarpal articulation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
thus more closely foreshadows the condition of extant hominoids, although to a lesser extent than in the stem great ape 
Pierolapithecus
(
92
), indicating a decreased emphasis on forearm use under weight-bearing conditions relative to 
Proconsul
(
88
). Several characteristics of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
(particularly the elongated forearm, the high arm angle, and the laterally facing bicipital tuberosity) further suggest some degree of below-branch forelimbdominated suspensory behaviors (
51
). However, the lack of hominoid-like elbow-stabilizing features in the humeroulnar joint (
83
, 
89
), the generalized metacarpophalangeal proportions, and the lack of marked phalangeal curvature suggest that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
was not specifically adapted to perform the acrobatic suspensory behaviors (ricochetal brachiation) displayed by extant gibbons.

Our cladistic analysis, based on both craniodental and postcranial characters, recovers a single most-parsimonious tree (Fig. 8 and table S15), indicating that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is more closely related to crown hominoids than other Miocene smallbodied catarrhines and 
Proconsul
are. With moderate support (bootstrap 71%, Bremer index 3), our results contradict the view of some authors that all of these taxa are stem catarrhines (preceding the divergence between hominoids and Old World monkeys) (
17
, 
21
) and concur instead with some previous cladistic analyses indicating a hominoid status for both 
Proconsul
(
2
, 
8
, 
22
) and, at least, dendropithecids (
8
, 
22
). Our analysis is inconsistent with the current consensus that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epipliopithecus
</tp:taxon-name>
is a pliopithecoid (
20, 66, 76, 78
); however, the internal phylogeny of pliopithecoids and dendropithecids is not settled by our results (it is recovered by the most-parsimonious tree but not by the bootstrap 50%-majority-rule consensus). Similarly, the phylogenetic relationships between the analyzed dryopithecines (
Hispanopithecus
and 
Pierolapithecus
) are not well resolved (the closer link between 
Pierolapithecus
and crown hominids has a Bremer index of 1 and bootstrap support of 56%). In contrast, our analysis recovers, with very high support (bootstrap 93 to 100%, Bremer indices 7 to 11), both the molecular phylogeny of extant hominoids (
1
, 
6
) and the stem hominid status of 
Pierolapithecus
and 
Hispanopithecus
(
9
, 
92
). The position of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
as a stem hominoid more derived than 
Proconsul
is relatively well supported (bootstrap 78%, Bremer index 2). When the analysis is repeated excluding all fossil taxa with large amounts of missing data (fig. S7), the position of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
as a stem hominoid more derived than 
Proconsul
is much better supported (bootstrap 100%, Bremer index 20); it is even more robust than the monophyly of crown hominoids (bootstrap 98%, Bremer index 11) and than the great-ape status of 
Pierolapithecus
and 
Hispanopithecus
(bootstrap 100%, Bremer index 13).

         <p>
Given that our analyses support 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
as a stem hominoid more derived than 
Proconsul
, the mosaic of primitive and derived features displayed by the former taxon is of utmost relevance for interpreting the evolution of several key features among catarrhine primates. Many authors agree that homoplasy has played an important role in hominoid postcranial evolution (
5
, 
9
, 
12
, 
92
), but 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
shows a mosaic of primitive and derived features both in the cranium and the postcranium. For the cranium, this is best illustrated by the short tubular (but incompletely ossified) external auditory meatus with a V-shaped end, which would imply the independent acquisition of a more completely ossified ectotympanic in cercopithecoids and hominoids. This has previously been posited by some authors (
20
), and it is suggested to some extent by the stem catarrhine 
Saadanius
(
22
), the stem Old World monkey 
Victoriapithecus
(
60
), and the stem ape 
Proconsul
(
97
); in these taxa, the ectotympanic, albeit slightly more developed, is still short, does not laterally exceed the postglenoid process, and lacks a completely closed terminal ventral tip (
Fig. 4
). In contrast, several other cranial features of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
are derived toward the crown-hominoid condition, generally more closely resembling hylobatids than hominids. Some of the similarities with gibbons (e.g., short face with a distinct muzzle and anteriorly situated telescopic orbits) may be size-related to a large extent (
98
), but others (horizontal and anteriorly directed carotid canal) are otherwise only known in hylobatids. Coupled with the fact that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
chronologically fits within the long ghost lineage of hylobatids, from their divergence from hominids at ~17 Ma (
1
) until their putative oldest record (
Yuanmoupithecus
) at 8 to 7 Ma (
10
, 
39
), these similarities raise the possibility that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
might be a stem hylobatid. This hypothesis is not favored by our total (craniodental plus postcranial) evidence–based cladistic analyses, which support instead a stem hominoid status for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
, mostly because of the lack of various crownhominoid postcranial synapomorphies. However, its hylobatid cranial features and small body size suggest that, at least in some respects, the last common ancestor of crown hominoids might have been more gibbon-like (or less great ape–like) than generally assumed (
6
, 
16
).
</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="inferred">
         <title>Orphanage</title>
         <p>
Furthermore, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
supports the view that some small-bodied catarrhines played a more important role in the emergence of crown hominoids than has generally been assumed over the past decades. The postcranial evidence provided by Miocene great apes such as 
Pierolapithecus
and 
Sivapithecus
(
9
, 
92
, 
99
) indicates that the last common ancestor of crown hominoids must have been postcranially more primitive than it would be inferred to be exclusively on the basis of extant forms. This supports some degree of parallel evolution in the postcranium between extant hylobatids and hominids (
5
), although not to such a great extent as if 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
was interpreted as a crown hominoid. As a stem ape, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
cannot resolve whether many of the postcranial derived features shared by extant hylobatids and hominids are homologous (
6
) or homoplastic (
5
), although 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
does suggest that a suite of features in the humeroradial and wrist joints might be homolgous. In these anatomical regions, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
displays much more extensive postcranial synapomorphies of crown hominoids than those convergently displayed by atelids, including a diarthrodial radioulnar joint, an expanded ulnar head, an incipient ulnar fovea, a long and thin styloid process with reduced contact with the relatively small triquetrum, and a distally projecting hamulus on the hamate. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
also displays incipient suspensory adaptations, although, based on currently available evidence, it is not possible to conclusively ascertain whether these were inherited by the last common ancestor of crown hominoids (and later secondarily lost in some fossil great apes such as 
Sivapithecus
and 
Pierolapithecus
) or whether they merely represent an independent acquisition of

Conclusions

</title>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
provides the first evidence of crownhominoid postcranial synapomorphies in a Miocene small-bodied catarrhine, thus demonstrating a greater diversity in postcranial morphology and positional behaviors than previously recognized among this paraphyletic assemblage of taxa. Three decades ago, the degree of parallel evolution required to evolve hylobatids from small-bodied catarrhines such as dendropithecids, albeit conceivable, was considered unlikely in light of the available evidence (
18
), because of the numerous parallelisms that would be required in crownhominoid (and even crown-catarrhine) features between hylobatids and hominids. Although the evidence provided by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
reduces this morphological gap, this taxon still falls short of being supported as a hylobatid by our cladistic analyses, which strongly favor instead the monophyly of extant hominoids with all fossil smallbodied catarrhines excluded. However, unlike dendropithecids, which are currently interpreted as stem catarrhines (
21
) or hominoids more basal than 
Proconsul
(
22
), 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is unambiguously interpreted as more closely related to crown hominoids. Given its chronology and geographic location, as well as the retention of plesiomorphic dental and some postcranial features that resemble those of small-bodied catarrhines such as dendropithecids, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pliobates
</tp:taxon-name>
is likely to be a latesurviving offshoot of a small African stem hominoid more closely related to crown hominoids than 
Proconsul
is. This has important implications for reconstructing the ancestral morphotype from which extant hominoids evolved: It suggests that some small-bodied catarrhines could have played a much more remarkable role in ape evolution than previously thought, and that the last common ancestor of crown hominoids was not necessarily great ape–like.

Apes are divided into two groups: larger-bodied apes, or hominoids, such as humans, chimps, and gorillas; and smaller-bodied hylobatids, such as gibbons. These two lineages are thought to have diverged rather cleanly, sharing few similarities after the emergence of crown hominoids. Alba 
et al.
describe a new ape from the Miocene era that contains characteristics from both hominoids and small-bodied apes (see the Perspective by Benefit and McCrossin). Thus, early small-bodied apes may have contributed more to the evolution of the hominoid lineage than previously assumed.
