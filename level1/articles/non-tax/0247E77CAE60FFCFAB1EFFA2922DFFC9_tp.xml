Abstract

</title>
         <p>The larval behaviors probably associated with respiration are reported in different larval</p>
         <p>
instars of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Luciola substriata
Gorham
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Coleoptera</tp:taxon-name>
: 
<tp:taxon-name>Lampyridae</tp:taxon-name>
). The behavior involved
</p>
         <p>exposing eighth abdominal segment with spiracles to the atmosphere when swim behavior</p>
         <p>
occurred to 1 
st
â€“2 
nd
and 3 
rd
â€“6 
th
instar larvae. In addition, 3 
rd
â€“6 
th
instar larvae exposed
</p>
         <p>second to seventh abdominal segments with spiracles to air when swimming. Swimming and</p>
         <p>the behavior that uses the force of body curving travelling in a head-to-tail direction</p>
         <p>
produces a sinusoidal wave. However, probably 1 
st
â€“2 
nd
instar larvae used both tracheal gills
</p>
         <p>
and the exposed posterior spiracle for respiration. Whereas 3 
rd
â€“6 
th
instar larvae lack
</p>
         <p>
tracheal gills, they probably rely only on tracheal respiration. The survival times of 1 
st
â€“2 
nd
</p>
         <p>
instar larvae were nine times to 3 
rd
â€“6 
th
instar larvae when the water in the beakers was
</p>
         <p>isolated from atmosphere by a thin plastic membrane. The potential for different selective</p>
         <p>pressures acting on these early and late instars was discussed.</p>

Aquatic fireflies attract attention because of their particular external morphology and adaptive behavior in aquatic environments (Jeng 
et al.
2003; Suzuki 
et al.
2002, 2004;

, 
b
). Majority of previous studies has been focused on the morphology, biology, ethology, ecology and artificial rearing (Okada 1928; Ohba 1988, 1996, 1997; Chen and Chen 1997;

Luciola substriata
Gorham
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Coleoptera</tp:taxon-name>
: Lympyridae: Luciolinae) was a rare aquatic firefly species with two different 
types
of larval stages. The 1 
st
â€“2 
nd
and 3 
rd
â€“6 
th
instar larvae were different from both morphology and behavior (Fu 
et al.
2004). The former was characterized by the possession of tracheal gills located on the first to seventh abdominal segments and posterior spiracles located on the eighth abdominal segment. The latter was characterized by the possession of spiracles located on the thorax and abdomen, and lacking tracheal gills (Zheng 
et al.
2007). The 1 
st
â€“2 
nd
instar larvae had tracheae without air sacs, 3 
rd
â€“6 
th
instar larvae had both tracheae and air sacs in the respiratory system (Zheng 
et al.
2007). The 1 
st
â€“2 
nd
instar larvae crawled mainly in the substrate and were capable of swimming ventral surface up from time to time, 3 
rd
â€“6 
th
instar larvae swam ventral surface up (back swimming) and they also remained stationary at the surface. During their back swimming, we found that 1 
st

and 3

th
instar larvae could expose their segments with spiracles to the air. We presumed that this kind of

Experiments.
The movements of 1 
st
â€“2 
nd
and 3 
rd
â€“6 
th
instar larvae (
30 larvae
for each 
type
) were videotaped (SONY DIGITAL ZOOM DCR-TRV530E PAL) in the laboratory. Larvae were fed in a transparent aquarium (
30 cm
X 
20 cm
X 
20 cm
) with 
10 cm
deep water, and they were filmed from lateral view out of the aquarium. Water temperature was 23 Â± 1 
Â°
C and atmosphere temperature was 25 Â± 1 
Â°
C. The aquarium had graduations on the lateral to determine the height of the prothorax, second and eighth abdominal segments that exposed to the air of 3 
rd
â€“6 
th
instar larvae. The prothorax, second and eighth abdominal segments of 3 
rd
â€“6

The video-tape was evaluated in film player (Real time) by manual advancement per 37 ms to check the position of red segments and determine their exposed height to the air and calculate the exposed time by showing time on video during the swimming sequences. At the same time, we checked and recorded the exposed height and time of second abdominal segment in four cycles. Time of a swimming cycle, exposed time of second to seventh abdominal segments (it is the sum time of second to seventh abdominal segments exposed time to the air by manual advancement to calculate) and eighth segment to the air depend on showing time on video. Additional pictures and a series of swimming behaviors including exposed their abdominal segments with spiracles were took by a camera (OTTIMO SHOTONE 698) according to the video screen. 1

The movement of the swimming larvae was similar to the breaststroke, creating a sinusoidal wave. Second to eighth abdominal segments were exposed to the air through back swimming. The sequence of movements during swimming were as follows: 1) larval body 
0.3 cm
under the surface, parallel with surface, pygopodium held vertically in contact with surface, prothorax sank a little, thoracic legs continually sculled backward at the surface (
Fig. 2a
); 2) prothorax continually sank and formed radian with abdomen, accumulating force to rebound eighth abdominal segment in contact with air (
Fig. 2b
); 3) mesothorax and metathorax started to sink, the radian became smaller and eighth abdominal segment became to expose to air (
Fig. 2c
); 4) the eighth abdominal segment shrank forward, made the whole larval body into the shape of an â€˜â€˜ S â€™â€™ (

In the process of back swimming, the motion of prothorax, second and eighth abdominal segment were each different (
Fig. 3
). In 
Figure 3
, the second and eighth abdominal segments were each exposed in atmosphere periodically, but the eighth abdominal segments were exposed for the greatest period of time. However, their segments that exposed height on the surface were also different. The eighth abdominal segment was higher than second abdominal segment apparently. In the four cycles of second abdominal segment during back swimming, we found they could expose it on surface in every cycle (
Fig. 4
).

The survival times of 1 
st
â€“2 
nd
instar larvae were longer than that of 3 
rd
â€“6 
th
instars (
Fig. 6
), maybe the reason was that the body of the 1 
st
â€“2 
nd
instar larvae was smaller compared with that of the 3 
rd
â€“6 
th
instars, and they can obtain dissolved oxygen through tracheal gills. On the other hand, 3 
rd
â€“6 
th
instar larvae, without tracheal gills, exposed their abdominal segments to air to breathe by spiracles probably, because 3 
rd
â€“6 
th
instar larvae could not absorb dissolved oxygen under water. At the same time, it may explain why survival times decreased sharply when 3 
rd
â€“6 
th
instar larvae could not expose their abdominal segments to the atmosphere (
Fig. 6
).
</p>
         <p>
This behavior of exposing their abdominal segments to the atmosphere of 
<tp:taxon-name>

â€“6 
th
instar larvae must remain near the surface in order to supply energy and oxygen which were needed to survive. This firefly may have evolved to lose tracheal gills and develop abdominal spiracles without hydrofuge hairs to facilitate simultaneously swim and respiratory behavior in 3

instar larvae. Because the phenomenon that swimming and respiratory behaviors occurred simultaneously not only potentially saves energy while maximizing respiration, but also decreases the chance to be preyed by nature enemies (Adis and Messner 1997).

In the first two cases, the insects can directly expose their spiracles to the atmosphere for respiration, while in the third case the insects must absorb dissolved oxygen in the water (JosÃ© and JosÃ© 1994). In this study, we only observed the phenomenon that the larval abdominal segments with spiracles were exposed to the air. However, this case was similar to the first and second categories mentioned above. We assumed that this kind of behavior was associated with respiration of larvae in this aquatic firefly, but it needs further study to verify.</p>
