         <p> Introduction </p>
         <p> Ecological studies on diets of lizards have contributed significantly to the
            development of several theories, including community succession, evolutionary processes,
            behavioral patterns ( ; ; ), foraging and life history traits ( ; ), and comparative
            biology ( ). Lizards display ecological variations influenced by seasons ( ; ), as well
            as variations in morphology and behavior ( ; ), especially neotropical lizards,
            revealing real challenges in establishing a general life history model ( ). </p>
         <p> Studies on energy support and trophic ecology are crucial for understanding
            evolutionary biology, natural history ( ), and energy allocation ( ). Moreover, the
            search for adequate nutrition presents a challenge for many lizard species, influencing
            their physical conditions ( ; ). This search can be influenced by biotic factors,
            including morphometric differences between females and males ( ; ), and abiotic factors,
            including environmental changes (especially seasonal environments) and food availability
            ( ; ; ). For neotropical lizards inhabiting the Caatinga biome ( ; ), food availability
            seems to be highly associated with unpredictable seasonality and precipitation levels (
            ; , ; ). </p>
         <p> Studies concerning energy balance and stomach content, reveal available biochemical
            components (proteins, lipids, and glycogen) and are crucial for understanding
            evolutionary history traits and how ecological aspects could lead to dietary differences
            ( ; ). Most lizard species are predators of small animals, including arthropods.
            However, there is a lack of published information concerning the dietary habits of
            neotropical lizards, especially with regard to the biochemical components of their diet. </p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name> Gymnodactylus geckoides </tp:taxon-name> is endemic to the Caatinga ( ),
            and several studies have reported its dietary composition ( ; ; ), a possible difference
            in diet between the sexes ( ; ) and its relationship with their morphology ( ; ).
            Although there are recent data on the diet of <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides
            </tp:taxon-name> and its morphology, information from Caatinga remains restricted to the
            populations from the Exu municipality, Pernambuco ( ; ) and Aiuaba and Barro
            municipalities, Ceara ( ). Moreover, studies reporting energy values of ingested prey or
            seasonal variations in the diet of the species could provide helpful information about
            their energy needs and use of the available food resources in the environment; however,
            these remain scarce. </p>
         <p> Recent studies have demonstrated adaptations in lizard feeding due to environmental
            seasonality and landscape changes, leading to variations in the number and volume of
            ingested prey ( ; ; ). Thus, the <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides </tp:taxon-name> diet
            varies seasonally and between sexes, depending on morphology and prey type, number,
            volume, and energy values. Therefore, the present study aimed to describe and update the
            information on the trophic ecology of <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides </tp:taxon-name> ,
            considering a population from a Caatinga remnant in Pernambuco state, Northeast Brazil.
            We verified variations in the prey type, number, volume, and energy values of stomach
            contents, emphasizing seasonal, morphological, and sex variations. </p>

         <title>N/A</title>
         <p>Materials and methods</p>
         <p>Study site</p>
         <p> This study was performed in Catimbau National Park (8°24'00"S to 8°36'35"S and
            37°09'30"W to 37°14'40"W), a protected area (PA) created by a federal decree in 2002.
            The area features conformations of the Caatinga biome, located at the center of
            Pernambuco, in the Ipanema Valley, and encompasses the municipalities of Buique ,
            Ibimirim, and Tupanatinga ( ) (Fig. 1 ). The PA area is approximately 62,300 ha and
            covers altitudes between 500 m to 1,000 m above sea level ( ). The climate is semiarid
            and strongly seasonal, with an annual precipitation between 0 and 256 mm and the highest
            rainfall levels between March and July ( ; ). The landscape includes evergreen and
            deciduous forest, with shrubby spineless vegetation, sandy soils, and rock fields ( ). </p>
         <p> Lizards' collection and processing </p>
         <p> Individuals were collected by active search along a sandy trail approximately 300 m
            long. Surveys were conducted at hourly intervals over three days. Active searches were
            carried out during the day (from 9:00 h to 14:00 h) and at night (from 16:00 h to 20:00
            h), with collections and observations made by a pair of observers, conducted monthly
            from September 2018 to August 2019 to record seasonal variations. We recorded the sex
            (female or male), and age (adult, juvenile, or sexually immature) of each individual.
            Sexual maturity was determined according to the gonad volume (&lt;0.1 mm³ for ovaries
            and &lt;1 mm³ for testicles) ( ; ). After capture, the collected individuals were
            weighed and subjected to a lethal injection of ketamine (10 mg/kg + 0.1-0.3 mg/kg). Due
            to the lack of significant variations in climatic conditions (precipitation and
            temperature) between the years (from 2014 to 2019) (see Suppl. material 1), the present
            study also incorporates data from individuals that were previously captured in Catimbau
            National Park in 2014 and curated at the Herpetological Collection of the Federal
            University of Paraiba , UFPB). The capture and euthanization procedures were
            standardized for both sampling years. </p>
         <p> After euthanization, the following morphometric variables were recorded using a digital
            caliper (0.01 mm): snout-vent length (SVL), body width (BW; at the broadest point), body
            height (BH; at the highest point), head height (HH; at the highest point), head width
            (HW; at the broadest point), head length (HL; from the tip of the snout to the anterior
            margin of the ear-opening), tail length (TL; from cloaca to the tip of tail), forelimb
            length (FL; from the forepaw-body bond to the tip of lamella), and hindlimb length (HLL;
            from the hind leg body bond to the tip of the lamella) ( ). Tail length was excluded
            from the analyses because most individuals had broken tails or signs of an earlier
            autotomy. After morphometric measurements were recorded, we removed the stomach contents
            of all individuals through a longitudinal incision from the throat to the vent. The
            contents were analyzed, and the prey was identified at the lower taxonomic level
            possible (order). In addition, the stomach contents of 48 individuals were refrigerated
            prior to biochemical analyses and 83 contents were preserved in 70% alcohol. </p>
         <p> The stomach contents were subjected to biochemical tests to measure the total protein,
            lipid, and glycogen proportion ( ). The contents were macerated in 0.5 mL of sodium
            phosphate buffer (pH 7.2; 0.1 mM) and centrifuged at 3,000 x g for three minutes. The
            supernatant (100 μL ) was removed from the resulting homogenates for protein measurement
            and the remaining homogenates were centrifuged again for lipids and glycogens. The
            Bradford method ( ) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were used as standards, with
            absorbance measured at 595 nm to determine the total protein quantity. Using the van
            Handel method (Van Handel 1985 a, b), 200 μL of the homogenates was added to 200 μL of
            sodium sulfate and 800 μL of methanol and chloroform (1:1) and centrifuged at 3,000 x g
            for three minutes in each experiment. The precipitate was used for glycogen analysis and
            the supernatant was transferred to a test tube for lipid analysis. Lipids were estimated
            spectrophotometrically using the sulfo-phospho-vanillin method ( ), while glycogen
            content was estimated using the anthrone-sulfuric acid method ( ), with both absorbances
            measured at 625 nm. Stomach contents with results outside of their respective confidence
            intervals for protein (0.095-0.602 µg /mL), lipid (0.039-0.603 µg /mL), and glycogen
            (0.226-1.575 µg /mL) were excluded from the analysis ( ). The results inserted on the
            confidence intervals were converted to cal/mg, using the dataset established by a
            calorimeter. Individual collection and all procedures of the present study were
            authorized by the Animal Use Environmental Agency (SISBIO # 64455-1 and SISBIO #
            29550-4) and the Ethics Committee (CEUA UFRPE 123/2018). </p>
         <p>Data analysis</p>
         <p> The packages corrplot and caret were used for morphometric analyses and the package
            mice for missing data imputation ( ; ). We tested sexual dimorphism for one single
            analysis of variance (ANOVA), which was tested using an adjusted linear model wrapping
            the lowest correlated measurements (&lt;0.7), as well as their interactions for both
            groups (females and males), whereas the highest correlated measurements (&gt; 0.7) were
            excluded from the analysis ( ). The less correlated measurements were isolated and
            subjected to nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), coupled with a PERMANOVA test,
            using vegan and ggpubr packages. This analysis was performed to determine distance and
            group overlap. All morphometric variables were log-transformed (base 10) before analysis
            to obtain normality. </p>
         <p>We recorded the length and width of the prey from the stomach contents using a digital
            calliper (0.01 mm) so long as it was not too fragmented. These measurements were used to
            estimate prey volume as an ellipsoid (V = 4 / 3π [w / 2] ². [l / 2]). We calculated the
            frequency, numeric and volumetric percentages, and relative importance index (RII) for
            each prey category. Estimates considered individual stomachs (IIS = (%N + %V)/2) and
            pooled stomachs (IPS = (%N + %V+ %F)/3), where N is the numeric percentage, V is the
            volume pooled percentage, and F is the occurrence frequency.</p>
         <p> Trophic niche diversity was calculated using the standardized Levin's index (Ba). Ba =
            (B-1) / (n-1), where (n) is the prey category and (B) represents Levin's index of niche
            breadth: B = 1 / Σpi ², where (p) is the proportion of each prey category (i). Ba ranges
            from 0 to 1, with values close to '1' indicating a generalized diet and values close to
            '0' specialized ( ). The index was used to verify the overall diet diversity and
            differences between seasons, with respect to the dry season (Bads) and the rainy season
            (Bars). We calculated diet overlap between females and males and dry and rainy seasons,
            which were estimated through the numeric and volumetric niche overlap indices ( ) using
            the following formula in the R package spaa : OFM = OMF = ∑pMipFi/√(p2Mi) √(p2Fi), where
            pMi is the male proportion prey category i, and pFi is the female proportion prey
            category i. </p>
         <p> We used the individual-level diet variation index (E) to analyze the presence and
            measurement of the degree of individual specialization (IS) ( ). This index is based on
            network theory and quantifies the average density of connections, corresponding to the
            average dissimilarity among individuals (interindividual variation condition). The
            values of E ranged from 0 (individuals with identical diets) to 1 (individuals with
            different diets), sharing dietary components to different degrees. The lower the number
            of consumed items, the greater the likelihood that individuals will show more varied
            stomach contents ( ). </p>
         <p> We tested whether individual specialization was present for its correlation with sex
            and seasonal variation, considering prey number. Based on the PCA component scores, we
            calculated a matrix (Suppl. material 2) of pairwise Euclidean morphological distances
            among all individuals. We also calculated the PS index, where pik and pjk represent the
            proportions of item category k in the diets of individuals i and j, respectively, to
            generate a pairwise diet overlap matrix among the individuals. Finally, the correlation
            between the diet overlap matrix and seasonal distance matrices was tested using a simple
            Mantel test (10,000 simulations) ( ). We would expect a negative correlation between
            matrices of diet overlap and seasonal distances if functional seasonality affected
            individual diets, indicating that individuals collected in the same season (small
            Euclidean distances) also show similar diets (high diet overlap), regardless of sex. </p>
         <p> A network analysis was performed to describe the resource patterns used by each
            individual. First, we built an individual resource matrix (R), with individuals in
            columns and resource categories in rows. Each element rij of R was filled with the
            number of ingested prey of resource j by individual i. From R, we depicted bipartite
            networks comprising two sets of nodes (individuals and resource categories) and lines
            linking each individual to each of their consumed resources ( ). Then, we described
            resource-sharing patterns between individuals testing for nestedness and modularity in
            the individual-resource networks. Nestedness consists of network propriety, which
            indicates the presence of highly connected nodes and other less connected nodes that
            interact in most cases with only at highly connected subset of nodes ( ). Here,
            nestedness indicates how much of the most specialized diet represents a subset of the
            more generalized ones ( ; ). All analyses were performed using ade4 , bipartite and
            RInSp packages. </p>
         <p> Variations between sex and season were analyzed considering individual stomach content
            according to the number and volume of ingested prey ( ). Generalized linear models (GLM)
            were produced using the number and volume of ingested prey as predictive models to test
            the variance between females and males and dry and rainy seasons. The GLM was used to
            avoid differences between sampling months and, consequently, captured individuals
            (predator and prey), using DHARMa and readxl packages ( ). A linear regression test (r²)
            was performed using SVL as an independent variable ( ; ) to analyze the correlation
            between morphology and ingested prey volume. </p>
         <p> We also compared the energy content (proteins, lipids, and glycogen) between the sexes
            and seasons using GLM analysis. Both factors (sex and season) were tested, considering
            proteins, lipids, and glycogen as variants to verify differences in energy content
            according to their interactions. The factors were tested simultaneously and separately
            to verify their influence on the energy content. The relationship between the number and
            volume of prey and energy values was measured by a multiple regression test (r²) using
            protein, lipids, and glycogen as dependent variables to associate the condition of the
            overall stomach content ( ). Statistical analyses were performed using the R program
            (v3.6.1 R Development Core Team 2019), and the individual resource networks were built
            in Pajek (&lt;Networks/Pajek (uni-lj.si)&gt;). </p>

         <p>Results</p>
         <p> A total of 83 individuals were collected throughout the sampling months, and another 74
            were obtained from scientific collections, giving a total sample size of 157
            individuals, composed of 63 females (40.1%), 68 males (43.3%), and 26 juveniles (16.5%).
            The average morphometric measurements for both females and males are shown in Table 1 ,
            with the smallest reproductive individuals having 34 mm (SVL). The least correlated
            measures (HLL, HW, HL, HH, and BH) indicated a lack of significant variations in
            morphology between sexes (ANOVA F 2,129 = 21.86, P = 0.74). The NMDS analysis pooled
            adult individuals (females and males) into similar groups, revealing high overlap for
            all measures analyzed, presenting low variation between mature individuals (Fig. 2 ),
            indication lack of sexual shape dimorphism (MANOVA F 2,129 = 1.23, P = 0.26). </p>
         <p> </p>
         <p> The diet dataset was obtained from dissected stomachs of 131 individuals: 56 females
            (42.7%), 66 males (50.3%), and nine juveniles (6.9%). Ten individuals (7.63%) had an
            empty stomach. Data on 1,035 food items were compiled and classified into 18 different
            categories, averaging 7.90 items/stomach. The diet was mainly composed of invertebrates
            (insects and arachnids) with occasional mineral, sand, and vegetal sediments (Table 2 ).
            The most abundant item was <tp:taxon-name>Isoptera</tp:taxon-name> , which represented
            over two-thirds of the prey, almost one-third of the prey frequency, and half of the
            prey volume. <tp:taxon-name>Coleoptera</tp:taxon-name> ,
               <tp:taxon-name>Blattodea</tp:taxon-name> , and
               <tp:taxon-name>Orthoptera</tp:taxon-name> were among the four most important
            categories, considering the pooled and individual stomach contents. </p>
         <p> </p>
         <p> Considering the pooled stomachs described above,
               <tp:taxon-name>Isoptera</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Coleoptera</tp:taxon-name>
            were the most significant numerically and volumetrically. Both indices (iis and ips)
            revealed that half of the <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides </tp:taxon-name> diet comprised
            only <tp:taxon-name>Isoptera</tp:taxon-name> . In addition, Levi's index indicated low
            trophic niche breadth (Ba = 0.27). Regarding seasonality, niche breadth revealed lower
            diversity of prey type ingested during the dry season (Bads = 0.52) than during the
            rainy season (Bars = 0.68). Diet quantity showed a high volume (0.78) and frequency
            (0.96) overlap between sexes, indicating that similar items were consumed by females and
            males, despite the niche breadth difference between seasons. </p>
         <p> We found low individual-level diet variation index values, indicating a similar diet
            between females and males, with lower variations during the dry season ( E = 0.18) than
            during the rainy season ( E = 0.27). This index, as well as the network analysis,
            indicated variation in individual specialization according to seasonality, with females
            and males displaying a high frequency of <tp:taxon-name>Isoptera</tp:taxon-name>
            ingestion during the dry season, and other prey types (
               <tp:taxon-name>Coleoptera</tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>Araneae</tp:taxon-name> ,
               <tp:taxon-name>Hymenoptera</tp:taxon-name> , and
               <tp:taxon-name>Orthoptera</tp:taxon-name> ) being consumed at higher frequencies
            during the rainy season (Fig. 3 ). </p>
         <p> Regarding individual stomachs, the GLM did not reveal significant variations between
            sexes, for both prey number (β +/- SE = -0.038 +/- 0.025, z = -1.509, p = 0.849;
            females: 0.90 +/- 1.11, males:0.70 +/- 0.97) and volume (β +/- SE = 0.147 +/- 0.378, z =
            0.389, p = 0.697; females: 1.78 +/- 2.21, males:1.39 +/- 2.17). Regarding seasonality,
            the GLM revealed significant variations in prey number (β +/- SE = -0.150 +/- 0.047, z =
            -3.205, p &lt;0.001; dry season:1.29 +/- 1.14, rainy season:0.79 +/- 0.69) and volume (β
            +/- SE = 0.005 +/- 0.002, z = 1.833, p = 0.05; dry season:0.76 +/- 0.41, rainy
            season:1.02 +/- 0.57). Therefore, both females and males had similar diet proportion,
            with a greater quantity of prey consumed during the dry season and a higher volume
            consumed during the rainy season. Consistent with previous studies, the capacity for
            consumption of higher prey volumes increased with predator morphology. However, linear
            regression revealed a weak relationship between SVL ( R ² = 0.03, F 1,113 = 4.33, P =
            0.03) and HW ( R ² = 0.05, F 1,113 = 6.42, P &lt;0.01), indicating a random pattern of
            prey ingestion by <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides </tp:taxon-name> . </p>
         <p> Forty-eight individuals were evaluated for the biochemical tests, with 24 analyzed for
            the dry season (14 females and ten males) and 24 for the rainy season (13 females and 11
            males). Regardless of season and sex, the average protein was 0.15 +/- 0.07 cal/mg (n =
            37; range = 0.04-0.32); lipids 1.92 +/- 1.59 cal/mg (n = 32; range = 0.36-6.19), and
            glycogen 3.54 +/- 1.95 cal/mg (n = 35; range = 1.09-7.61). The GLM test did not reveal
            significant variation in the amounts of protein and lipid between sexes and seasons,
            indicating similar rates of consumption between females and males and between dry and
            rainy seasons (Table 3 and Fig. 4 ). A slightly higher rate was recorded for proteins in
            females during the rainy season, whereas males displayed higher rates during the dry
            season. Regarding lipids, a slightly higher rate was recorded in females in both
            seasons, with higher values obtained in the dry season. In contrast, glycogen exhibited
            significant variance according to season, with greater amounts during the rainy season
            for both sexes (Table 3 and Fig. 4 ). </p>
         <p> </p>
         <p> Multiple regression tests showed positive results and a weak correlation between
            nutritional substances and stomach content. Proteins exhibited the highest correlation
            (45%; CI = 30.67; R² = 0.45), followed by glycogen (10%; CI = 5.23; R² = 0.10), and
            lipids (8%; CI = 0.67; R² = 0.08), with no significant correlation (p&gt; 0.05).
            Regarding prey type, we investigated reference values for four different morphotypes (
               <tp:taxon-name>Isoptera</tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>Orthoptera</tp:taxon-name> ,
               <tp:taxon-name>Coleoptera</tp:taxon-name> , and
               <tp:taxon-name>Lepidoptera</tp:taxon-name> larvae), which were found individually in
            the stomach contents. Despite presenting high importance index,
               <tp:taxon-name>Isoptera</tp:taxon-name> yielded three-five times less energy in
            protein content, three-ten times less energy in lipids, and three-five times less energy
            in glycogen than other prey types consumed at a lower frequency (Table 4 ). </p>

         <p>Discussion</p>
         <p> Sexual dimorphism was absent in our study. In lizards, sexual dimorphism may be related
            to different microhabitats, diets, and reproduction (sexual selection and clutch size) (
            ; ; ). However, since females and males displayed similarities in the resources used
            (microhabitat and feeding), considering the gregarious distribution recorded during
            fieldwork and fixed clutch size in females (one egg), it is not surprising that
               <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides </tp:taxon-name> lack sexual dimorphism. In addition,
            the lack of morphological variation between females and males indicates that both sexes
            are subjected to similar environmental adaptive pressures ( ). Individuals in the study
            population reached sexual maturity above 34 mm (SVL). </p>
         <p> A similar diet was recorded between females and males of <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides
            </tp:taxon-name> , with the same quantities of prey ingested. Half of the diet is
            comprised of a single prey type ( <tp:taxon-name>Isoptera</tp:taxon-name> ).
               <tp:taxon-name>Isoptera</tp:taxon-name> constitute a prominent insect order, mainly
            in semiarid biomes such as Caatinga ( ; ), displaying a high nest frequency (90 nests
            per hectare - Caatinga) ( ; ). Because <tp:taxon-name>Isoptera</tp:taxon-name> are
            usually found in microhabitats with a high concentration of organic material, such as
            leaf litter, shrubs, and fallen trunks ( ; ), which constitutes microhabitats likely
            occupied by both females and males of <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides </tp:taxon-name> ( ),
            it is not surprising that a large frequency of <tp:taxon-name>Isoptera</tp:taxon-name>
            is included in their diet. In addition, the importance of this prey type and their
            constant frequency during the year, considering that geckos are highly chemosensory ( ;
            ), indicate that <tp:taxon-name>Isoptera</tp:taxon-name> display a guaranteed feeding
            source for both females and males of <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides </tp:taxon-name> ,
            resulting in a high food niche overlap between females and males. </p>
         <p> This lizard consumed both sedentary and active prey. Generally, generalist lizards
            adopt a mixed foraging strategy (ambush and active forager) ( ; ), modifying their
            hunting strategies according to the pressures imposed by the environment ( ; ), passing
            away with lizard specimens specializing in certain food items, or displaying a
            particular foraging mode ( ). Therefore, the present study indicates that variations in
               <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides </tp:taxon-name> behavior could be associated with
            climate and landscape conformational changes in the Caatinga biome, with changes
            proportional to different prey types and other factors, such as their abundance ( ; ; ). </p>
         <p> The seasonal variation of the diet involved prey type, as well as the numbers and
            volume ingested. Our results showed individual-level diet variation patterns in
               <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides </tp:taxon-name> , implying more similar diets among
            individuals during the dry season than during the rainy season ( ; ; ). Therefore,
               <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides </tp:taxon-name> tend to be more proactive during the
            dry season, seeking and establishing territory close to
               <tp:taxon-name>Isoptera</tp:taxon-name> nests. On the other hand, as long as food
            availability increases with rainfall levels, <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides
            </tp:taxon-name> seem to display fairly static stationary behavior, often with a range
            of prey types, as well as prey number ( ; ; ). These variations in feeding habits seem
            to help <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides </tp:taxon-name> remain adaptable to environmental
            seasonality, mainly considering prey availability ( ; , ; ), which is also suggested by
            the variations in niche breadth between seasons ( ; ). </p>
         <p> Biochemical tests enabled the description of the average available protein, lipid, and
            glycogen, establishing primary nutritional values from some prey types individually. Our
            records of isolated prey indicated that one or two units of prey such as
               <tp:taxon-name>Orthoptera</tp:taxon-name> and
               <tp:taxon-name>Lepidoptera</tp:taxon-name> larvae may yield the same calories as 5 to
            11 units of other prey types such as <tp:taxon-name>Isoptera</tp:taxon-name> ,
            reinforcing theories that there could be variations of energy levels provided by
            different prey types ingested, as well as a particular fondness for energetically
            advantageous prey, mainly regarding an energy-expensive life stage ( ; ). On a
            progressive scale, glycogen is first metabolized into glucose. In the absence of
            circulating glucose, lipids are released for energetic metabolism, generating an
            eco-biochemical cause-and-effect cycle (hypercaloric prey selection generating energetic
            absorption, leading to more efficient and greater lizard fitness) ( ). Therefore, the
            ingestion of energetically advantageous prey seems to make available more energy with a
            lower number of prey ingested ( ; ). </p>
         <p> Our results indicated that protein and lipid levels did not vary significantly with
            seasonality. In <tp:taxon-name>Lepidosauria</tp:taxon-name> , some species seem to
            display digestion processes that are highly dependent on body temperature ( ; ), whereas
            other species' digestion processes may be insensitive to body temperature ( ; ). Sugars
            constitute the most important energy component in the diet of lizards, presenting the
            most direct energy source ( ; ). According to and , the higher activity of
            sugar-digesting enzymes in warmer environments could be explained by the fact that
            optimum temperature for amylase in <tp:taxon-name>Lepidosauria</tp:taxon-name> is over
            40 °C. However, since the environmental temperature does not display significant
            variation in Caatinga despite high seasonality, sugar digestion probably does not seem
            to be affected by body temperature in <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides </tp:taxon-name> ,
            maintaining those temperatures at similar levels in both dry and rainy seasons (Comm.
            Pess. Leonardo P.C. Oitaven). Lipids are stable organic compounds, only slightly soluble
            in water and require complex and time-consuming, emulsification and catabolic procedures
            ( ). According to Stryer (1998), many intestinal enzymes, as well as lipolytic enzymes,
            tend to reach maximum activity at 42 °C, and are much more effective at higher
            temperatures. Bonded to the low variation in body temperature, lipids seem to be
            consumed at similar rates in both seasons by <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides
            </tp:taxon-name> , possibly used at a lower frequency compared to glycogen, which could
            also be applied to protein absorption ( ; ). Therefore, the lower glycogen levels
            recorded during the dry season are probably more associated with higher energy demand
            for the lizards due to feeding search ( ). </p>
         <p> Individuals tend to spend little energy capturing prey and are more selective according
            to the increase in prey availability ( ). For <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides
            </tp:taxon-name> , the energy difference seems to be offset by both prey number and
            volume ingested, with individuals able to invest in greater numbers of smaller preys,
            ingested at higher frequency, as well as a smaller number of bigger preys, consumed at
            lower frequency ( ; ). Therefore, the present study indicates plasticity in
               <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides </tp:taxon-name> ' behavior, with individuals
            alternating their hunting strategies, strongly bonded to environmental restrictions ( ;
            ). </p>
         <p> Taken together, the present study represents an effort to understand the trophic
            ecology, such as energy values, from a new perspective, presenting the prey content of
               <tp:taxon-name> G. geckoides </tp:taxon-name> . The present study also reinforces the
            importance of further studies using lizards and other vertebrates as models to
            understand their feeding strategies, as well as plasticity in seasonal environments. The
            lack of this information for Brazilian species hinders the development of functional
            management plans for biodiversity conservation. </p>
