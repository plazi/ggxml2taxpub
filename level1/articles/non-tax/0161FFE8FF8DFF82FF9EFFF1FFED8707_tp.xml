         <p> The intertidal distribution of the free-swimming stage of the pea crab <tp:taxon-name>
               Pinnotheres bidentatus Sakai, 1939 </tp:taxon-name> was examined on the K aomei
            coastal at of western central Taiwan . Most pea crabs were collected from tidal waters
            close to the shoreline regardless of the collecting treatments utilized. Results suggest
            that the pea crab population remains inshore during ebb tides. Many hard and post-hard
            stages of <tp:taxon-name> P. bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> were discovered, including
            ovigerous females. The host was found to be <tp:taxon-name> Laternula marilina
               (Valenciennes, 1860) </tp:taxon-name> (M ollusca:
               <tp:taxon-name>Bivalvia</tp:taxon-name> : <tp:taxon-name>Laternulidae</tp:taxon-name>
            ). The infestation percentage of the bivalve was high (average 74.6%). However, this may
            be due to collections of the bivalve population in the present study being skewed
            towards large sizes. This biased size structure of the host population may be also
            responsible for lack of positive size correlation between number and size of male and
            female symbiotic crabs and the host. Multiple infestations of <tp:taxon-name> P.
               bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> appear to be uncommon for <tp:taxon-name> L. marilina
            </tp:taxon-name> . Single infestations might be a model for bivalves in tropical regions
            where the sea is relatively oligotrophic and food competition may be enhanced with
            multiple infestations. In comparison to other members of the genus <tp:taxon-name>
               Pinnotheres </tp:taxon-name> or related species (e.g. <tp:taxon-name> P. pisum
               (Linnaeus, 1767) </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> Zaops ostreum (Say, 1817))
            </tp:taxon-name> , the body size of sexually mature female <tp:taxon-name> P. bidentatus
            </tp:taxon-name> is relatively small, even though it produces similar size eggs
            (approximately 300 microns). The general rule for size correlation between fecundity and
            female size in brachyuran crabs holds for <tp:taxon-name> P. bidentatus </tp:taxon-name>

            <tp:taxon-name> Pinnotheres bidentatus Sakai, 1939 </tp:taxon-name> , is one of the more
            poorly understood pinnotherids among those originally described from Japan . Its
            occurrence has been noted in several reports (e.g. ; ; ; ) but little additional
            information has been reported on its biology. Recently, noted that the species swarms in

            and post-hard stage female of this pea crab remains unknown. </p>

         <p> coastal at posed an interesting question on the tidal distribution of this pea crab. It
            is one of the largest tidal ats on the west coast of Taiwan . This coastal at is mostly
            immersed during ooding tides regardless of lunar phases, but the water margin retreats
            2–3 km from the shoreline during ebb tides. All free-swimming stages of <tp:taxon-name>
               P . bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> collected in this coastal area during 1994–1995 were
            from tidal waters near inshore areas during ooding tides (Hsueh, unpublished data). The
            presence of these pea crabs in shoal waters suggested two possibilities: (1) they may
            either reside in subtidal waters but are transported in and out of shoal waters by tidal
            currents, or (2) they seek shelter in the bottom substrata or as infauna in some host in
            shoal areas during low tides but swim into water columns during ooding tides. The tidal
            distribution of these free-swimming pea crabs was not clear. Ascertaining the tidal
            distribution of the male crabs may thus lead to the discovery of the potential host,
            which until now, has not been known. </p>
         <p> In 1999, a search for the potential host and post-hard stages of <tp:taxon-name>
               Pinnotheres bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> was initiated. Consequently, many hard and
            post-hard stages of the species were foun d to be commensal in the bivalve,
               <tp:taxon-name> Laternula marilina (Valenciennes, 1860) </tp:taxon-name> (family
               <tp:taxon-name>Laternulidae</tp:taxon-name> ). The present study reports the tidal
            distribution, symbiotic association and reproduction of <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus
            </tp:taxon-name> from Taiwan . </p>

         <p> The study was conducted at the Kaomei coastal at, Taichung County , Taiwan (24ss39¾N,
            120ss35¾E, gur e 1). This tidal at covers 6 km 2 and is located between Taichung Harbor
            and the mouth of the Tachia River . A 2-km long cobble pile constructed perpendicular to
            the shoreline divides the tidal at into two uneven subareas, with the smaller area ( 375
            m in width) immediately adjacent to the mouth of the Tachia River . This smaller tidal
            at was the chosen sampling area for the present study. Most of the area of this smaller
            tidal at is submerged by ooding tides twice daily regardless of lunar phases, with the
            exception of some high intertidal areas such as the salt marsh and the sand beach next
            to breakwaters that are only immersed by high spring tides . </p>
         <p> The tidal distribution of the free-swimming stage of the pea crab was examined during
            spring tides from late fall to early winter of 1997 when the pea crab is abundant. Four
            stations were set perpendicular to the shoreline. Distance of the sampling stations to
            the shoreline were 100 m (Station I), 800 m (Station II), 1500 m (Station III) and 2200
            m (Station IV), respectively (gure 1). At each station three sets of plankton nets were
            installed with each approximately 30 m apart. Each set had three plankton nets, one
            facing seaward and the other two (one on top of the other) facing landward. The
            seaward-facing and upper landward-facing nets were allowed to rise and fall along the
            supporting rod with tides, but the lower landwardfacing net was tied at groun d level.
            Sampling was conducted daily from 28 N ovember to 2 D ecember and 12–16 D ecember 1997,
            respectively. Plankton nets were deployed and recovered twice following each day-time
            and night-time high tides to collect pea crabs. </p>
         <p> The search for the host and post-hard stage <tp:taxon-name>Pinnotheres
               bidentatu</tp:taxon-name> s was conducted on 2 September 1999 . Potential hosts,
            including three species of tubicolous polychaetes, <tp:taxon-name> Diopatra chiliensis
               Quatrefages, 1865 </tp:taxon-name> (family <tp:taxon-name>Onuphidae</tp:taxon-name>

            </tp:taxon-name> (family <tp:taxon-name>Terebellidae</tp:taxon-name> ); several species
            of bivalves, Sangunolaria diphos (Linnaeus, 1771) (family
               <tp:taxon-name>Psammobiidae</tp:taxon-name> ), <tp:taxon-name> Laternula marilina

               Crassostrea spp. </tp:taxon-name>
         </p>
         <p> (family <tp:taxon-name>Ostreidae</tp:taxon-name> ); and burrows of the mud shrimp,
               <tp:taxon-name> Upogebia edulis </tp:taxon-name> Ngoc-H o and Chan, 1992 (family
               <tp:taxon-name>Upogebiidae</tp:taxon-name> ). All potential hosts were excavated or
            dissected open. Of these potential hosts, the bivalve, <tp:taxon-name> L . marilina
            </tp:taxon-name> , was found to be heavily infested by <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus
            </tp:taxon-name> . This bivalve inhabits sandy mud/muddy substrata near mid-intertidal
            areas which receive freshwater discharges from man-made channels or rice elds (see gure
            1). Consequently, 358 bivalves (144 on 2 September and 214 in the second collection on 5
            October 1999 ) were collected and put individually in sealed bags. The number, sex and
            carapace width (CW) of the pea crab as well as shell length (SL) of the host were
            recorded. Fecundity of ovigerous females and the egg diameter (unpreserved) were
            estimated and measured. A linear correlation analysis was used to examine the
            relationship between number and body sizes of both sexes of the pea crab to the body
            size of the host. The relationship between fecundity and the body size of ovigerous
            females was examined using simple linear regression ( ). </p>

         <p> A total of 969 pea crabs was collected in the distributional study. Mean daily
            abundance of pea crabs ranged from 0.5Ô 0.2 to 9.4Ô 3.0. Of these, most were taken from
            Stations I and II, with few individuals taken from Stations III and IV, regardless of
            net positions (e.g. landward-facing vs seaward-facing; rising or falling with tides vs
            xed) (gure 2). Among bivalves taken from September and October 1999 , approximately 83%
            and 70% of individuals (average 74.6%), respectively, were infested by pea crabs. A
            total of 305 pea crabs was found. The overall male:female ratio was close to 1:1
            (149:156). Of 156 females collected, 37 individuals were found carrying eggs, but an
            additional 11 individuals had ova within the body cavity which appeared ready for
            extrusion. Percentages of ovigerous females varied in the two collections, with a
            greater percentage in October (35.4%) than in September (24.3%). Most of the pea crabs
            had body sizes which exceeded 3.0 mm CW, with only 11 individuals smaller than 2.5 mm
            CW. Mean body sizes and the ranges for males, non-ovigerous females and ovigerous
            females were 3.5Ô 0.4 ( 1.5–4.4 mm CW), 3.3Ô 0.7 ( 0.6–5.3 mm CW) and 5.3Ô 0.5 (4.0– 6.1
            mm CW), respectively. The number and sex ratios of pea crabs in each bivalve also varied
            ( table 1 ). Infestation ranged from zero to three crabs per bivalve, with most bivalves
            (59.7%) infested by a single pea crab. Bivalves with two symbiotic crabs accounted for
            an average of 9.5% of the total bivalves collected. Among the bivalves, 50% of them
            hosted one male and one female crab, with the others hosting either two males or two
            females . There were only six incidences when three pea crabs were found in a bivalve.
            These pea crabs had a sex ratio of two males to one female , one male to two females or
            all males. M ost ovigerous female crabs were found alone in the host, with exceptions of
            10 cases in which the ovigerous female was accompanied by either one male , one female ,
            one male and one female , or two males . Females present with an ovigerous female in a
            host were usually immature, except in one case when two ovigerous females were present
            in a host. </p>
         <p> Shell lengths of the bivalves collected in this study ranged from 24 to 40 mm , with a
            mean of 33.2Ô 2.9 mm . There was no positive correlation between SL of the bivalve and
            the number of pea crabs present ( r 50.026, p &gt;0.05). Smaller bivalves hosted as many
            pea crabs as large-sized bivalves. There was also no positive correlation between the SL
            of the bivalve and the body size of the male ( r 50.092, p &gt;0.05) </p>
         <p> and immature female ( r 50.162, p &gt;0.05) pea crabs (gure 3). H owever, the larger
            bivalves hosted larger ovigerous females ( r 50.557, p &lt;0.001). </p>
         <p> The smallest female with eggs extruded and non-extruded measured 4.0 and 3.4 mm CW,
            respectively, but females with swollen or developing gonadal tissues were as small as
            2.9 mm CW. The largest immature female (without swollen gonadal tissues) measured 4.3 mm
            CW. Fecundity of ovigerous females ranged from 225 to 1786 eggs per brood, with a mean
            of 515 Ô 199 eggs per brood ( n 530). Mean diameter of eggs was 0.29Ô 0.02 mm ( n 572).
            There was a positive correlation between log number of eggs per brood and log body size
            of ovigerous female ( r 2 50.457, p &lt;0.0001; gur e 4). </p>

         <p> The tidal distribution of the free-swimming stages of <tp:taxon-name> Pinnotheres
               bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> shows a strong relationship with inshore areas of the K
            aomei coastal at, but a few individuals were found up to 2 km from the shoreline. Low
            numbers of pea crabs collected at Stations III and IV regardless of the collecting
            treatments utilized suggest that the inshore population of the pea crab may not be
            imported from oOEshore waters during ooding tides and transported out of inshore areas
            during ebbing tides. The abundance of free-swimming stage <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus
            </tp:taxon-name> collected by lower landward-facing nets at Stations I and II suggests
            that these pea crabs may migrate to the bottom of the water column to avoid oOEshore
            transport during ebbing tides. However, the small diOEerences in abundance between upper
            and lower landwardfacing nets provides no information on the time of onset of downward
            migration. Stations I and II were exposed to air approximately 2 h after the high slack
            tide </p>
         <p>(personal observation), which suggests that the pea crabs may migrate down to the bottom
            to nd a host within this time limit.</p>
         <p> Information on vertical migration of adult brachyurans in tidal waters for maintenance
            of positions in a given ecosystem is limited, but it has been reported for larvae of
            estuarine brachyur ans ( ; ; ). noticed that larvae of <tp:taxon-name> Rhithropanopeus
               harrisii (Gould, 1841) (Panopeidae) </tp:taxon-name> tended to migrate to levels of
            the water column where there was no net ow shoreward or seaward during the tidal cycle;
            thus, promoting larval retention in the estuary. reported that megalopae of
               <tp:taxon-name> Callinectes sapidus (Rathbun, 1896) (Portunidae) </tp:taxon-name>
            swim in surface waters during ooding tides and migrate to the bottom during ebbing tides
            to ensure retention in an estuary. The apparent advantages for the population of
               <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> remaining inshore may be the presence
            of potential hosts (e.g. bivalves, <tp:taxon-name> Laternula marilina </tp:taxon-name> ;
            tubicolous polychaetes <tp:taxon-name> Chaetopterus variopedatus </tp:taxon-name> )
            which provide shelters for pea crabs during ebb tides and a tidal environment
            semi-protected from surge that favours mate- or host-seeking during ood tides. The
            discovery of the bivalve host with a high percentage of infestation of <tp:taxon-name> P
               . bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> in nearshore muddy habitats supports the inshore tidal
            distribution of this pea crab population. </p>
         <p> However, there is a cost to <tp:taxon-name> Pinnotheres bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> for
            staying in inshore areas of the Kaomei tidal at. The pea crabs are subjected to salinity
            changes induced by meteorological events (e.g. typhoons and severe local thunderstorms
            in summer) or human activities (freshwater runoOE of rice elds from spring to fall, and
            eelpout sheries in winter). In extreme cases, part of the intertidal areas of the K
            aomei tidal at may be suddenly exposed to 0‰ salinity for days during strong typhoons.
            However, <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> may adapt well to this salinity
            stressed environment. found that <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> showed
            no mortality and remained active when abruptly subjected to low (1–5‰, with 1‰ interval)
            and brackish (5–30‰, with 5‰ interval) salinity environments from ambient salinity (26‰)
            for up to 2 weeks. In the same study, pea crabs died within 24 h when transferred
            directly from 26‰ salinity to 0‰ salinity. However, they were observed to swim actively
            and continuously in water columns for several hours, presumably an escape behaviour from
            stressful environments. The ability to tolerate low salinities among pinnotherids
            varies. Some species (e.g. <tp:taxon-name> Zaops ostreum (Say, 1817) </tp:taxon-name> ,
            previously placed in <tp:taxon-name> Pinnotheres </tp:taxon-name> , de M anning, 1993)
            cannot tolerate low salinities (N aga bhush anam, 1965), while others (e.g.
               <tp:taxon-name> P . corbiculae Sakai, 1939 </tp:taxon-name> ) may even invade almost
            freshwater environments ( ). </p>
         <p> The high number of hard and post-hard stages, including ovigerous females, of
               <tp:taxon-name> Pinnotheres bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> found in <tp:taxon-name>
               Laternula marilina </tp:taxon-name> suggest that this bivalve may be the primary or
            the nal host for the pea crab. However, small individuals ( 1.5–2.5 mm CW), one of the
            major components of the <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> population in
            the 1994–1995 study (Hsueh, unpublished data), were not found to be abundant in
               <tp:taxon-name> L . marilina </tp:taxon-name> , indicating that small pea crabs may
            utilize other benthic fauna or structures as alternative shelters during ebb tides. Most
               <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> less than 2.5 mm CW are not sexually
            mature (Hsueh, unpublished data), and feeding on particulate matter ( ) in tidal waters
            during the free-swimming phase may be more important for them than searching for mates.
            Several studies have suggested that the swimming behaviour of pinnotherids may not be
            restricted to mating but may also serve for feeding ( ; ). reported <tp:taxon-name>
               Tritodynamia horvathi </tp:taxon-name> N obili, 1905 constantly moving their
            maxillipeds to feed on <tp:taxon-name> Artemia nauplii </tp:taxon-name> and food pellets
            when swimming in aquaria. observed swimming <tp:taxon-name> T . horvathi
            </tp:taxon-name> in the cold season when there is no mating. These pea crabs were also
            observed at this time to be using their maxillipeds to feed in the water column.
            However, free-swimming <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> in Kaomei tidal
            waters would eventually need to nd shelter during ebb tides when the tidal at is
            exposed. The complex burrows made by <tp:taxon-name> Upogebia edulis </tp:taxon-name> or
            scattered tubes from tubicolous polychaetes around the vicinity of <tp:taxon-name> L .
               marilina </tp:taxon-name> would seem to be good temporary refuges if the crabs cannot
            nd the primary host in time. Although it is not easy to verify if small specimens of
               <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> were utilizing burrows of
               <tp:taxon-name> U . edulis </tp:taxon-name> , some small <tp:taxon-name> P .
               bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> found in the tubes of <tp:taxon-name> Chaetopterus
               variopedatus </tp:taxon-name> support this hypothesis (Hsueh, unpublished data).
            Multiple hosts appear to be common among members of the genus <tp:taxon-name>
               Pinnotheres </tp:taxon-name> (Christensen and McD ermott, 1958). reported that many
               <tp:taxon-name> Pinnotheres species </tp:taxon-name> from Japanese waters have more
            than six bivalve hosts. reported a secondary host, the mussel <tp:taxon-name> Modiolus
               demissus (Dillwyn, 1817) </tp:taxon-name> , for the oyster crab, <tp:taxon-name>
               Zaops ostreum </tp:taxon-name> . Commensal associations of <tp:taxon-name>
               Pinnotheres </tp:taxon-name> with diOEerent types of hosts have also been observed.
            Christensen and McD ermott (1958) noted that <tp:taxon-name> Tumidotheres maculatus
               (Say, 1818) </tp:taxon-name> (previously placed in <tp:taxon-name> Pinnotheres
            </tp:taxon-name> , de ; ) has been taken from bivalves and tubes of the polychaete
               <tp:taxon-name> Chaetopterus </tp:taxon-name> . Moreover, diOEerences in the type of
            the host association by diOEerent stages of the crab have been reported. Christensen and
            McD ermott (1958) noted that the invasive and pre-hard stages of <tp:taxon-name> P .
               pisum (Linnaeus, 1767) </tp:taxon-name> are found only in the clam, <tp:taxon-name>
               Spisula solida (Linnaeus, 1758) </tp:taxon-name> , whereas the hard stage could be
            found in the initial and the nal host species. Interestingly, found no symbiotic crab in
               <tp:taxon-name> Laternula sp. </tp:taxon-name> ( 5 <tp:taxon-name> L .
            </tp:taxon-name> marilina , personal observation) which inhabits the Bazhan Stream
            estuary (23ss20¾N 120ss10¾E, approximately 48 km south-west of the K aomei tidal at),
            suggesting the absence of <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> in that
            estuary. reported a population of an obligate sea cucumber symbiont, <tp:taxon-name>
               Pinnotheres halingi </tp:taxon-name> H amel, N g and M ercier, 1999 (
               <tp:taxon-name>Pinnotheridae</tp:taxon-name> ), which was harboured only in the
            population of the sea cucumber, <tp:taxon-name> Holothuria scabra (Jaeger, 1833)
            </tp:taxon-name> , from Kogu Halingi Bay , Kohinggo Island , but not in sea cucumbers of
            the same species from diOEerent habitats of the same island or the same island chain (
            Solomon Islands ). They suggested that local physical environments (e.g. topography,
            currents) may be contributing factors for the presence of this symbiotic crab in the sea
            cucumber in Kogu Halingi Bay . </p>
         <p> The size structure of the bivalve population appears to play an important role in
            determining the percentage of infestation by the symbiotic crab and the size structure
            of the crab population. examined the commensal association of <tp:taxon-name>
               Pinnotheres pisum </tp:taxon-name> with two species of the mussel, <tp:taxon-name>
               Mytilus </tp:taxon-name> , and suggested that the larger the host, the higher the
            percentage of infestation. He found the largest <tp:taxon-name> M . edulis Linneaus,
               1758 </tp:taxon-name> with 80–100% infestation. Small bivalves less than 24 mm SL
            were absent from the present collection, suggesting that the size structure of the
            bivalve population is skewed to larger sizes (an indication that this was the
            nonrecruiting season for the bivalve). The incidence of infestation of <tp:taxon-name>
               Laternula marilina </tp:taxon-name> by <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus
            </tp:taxon-name> averaged 75%. H owever, the lack of positive size correlation between
            the body size of male and non-ovigerous female <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus
            </tp:taxon-name> and the shell length of <tp:taxon-name> L . marilina </tp:taxon-name>
            may re ect the size distribution of the bivalves taken from the eld. M ost male and
            non-ovigero us female pea crabs collected from the host were relatively large. It is
            possible that these large non-ovigerous females settled in the host to await the visits
            of large males which are often sexually mature (Hsueh, unpublished data). A similar
            result for size correlation between the symbiotic crab and the host was reported by ,
            who found no positive correlation between the size of female <tp:taxon-name>
               Tumidotheres maculatus </tp:taxon-name> and the length of its bivalve hosts which
            measured rarely less than 45 mm SL. H owever, in several other reports, a positive size
            correlation between the symbiotic crab (at least for the females) and the host was
            observed when the entire size group of the host was collected from various seasons ( ;
            Christensen and McD ermott, 1958; ; ). This suggested that the growth of symbionts was
            dependent on the growth of the hosts (Christensen and McD ermott, 1958; ). This
            growth-dependent hypothesis may be applied to explain the presence of a positive
            correlation between the size of ovigerous females and the host in this study. </p>
         <p> Multiple infestations by <tp:taxon-name> Pinnotheres bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> appear
            uncommon for <tp:taxon-name> Laternula marilina </tp:taxon-name> . This may not be due
            to the relatively small size of the bivalve (maximum size 40 mm SL in the present
            study). Small <tp:taxon-name> Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin, 1791) </tp:taxon-name> (
            32.4 mm SL) were observed to host as many as 18 <tp:taxon-name> Zaops ostreum
            </tp:taxon-name> (see ). In contrast, a large bivalve, <tp:taxon-name> Sanguinolaria
               acuta (Linnaeus, 1771) </tp:taxon-name> (maximum size about 80 mm SL), occurring in
            the Bazhan Stream estuary of western central Taiwan , was reported with 90–97%
            infestations by single <tp:taxon-name> P . tsingtaoensis Shen, 1932 </tp:taxon-name>
            (see ). Incidences of high percentages of single infestation observed in Taiwan waters
            suggest that this may be the association model for symbiotic crabs and bivalves in
            tropical regions, where the sea is considered relatively oligotrophic. Multiple
            infestations may enhance food competition among crabs. Moreover , most sexually mature
            female <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> were observed to live by
            themselves, and this is not exceptional among other species ( ; ; ). stated that only
            one female could reach sexual maturity if a number of female oyster crabs invaded the
            same host, and observed that excessive females either perished or migrated to other
            hosts. The single incidence of two ovigerous female <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus
            </tp:taxon-name> occurring together in the host during this study can be explained only
            as an exception . </p>
         <p> The brood size of ovigerous <tp:taxon-name> Pinnotheres bidentatus </tp:taxon-name>
            appears to vary substantially. The largest ovigerous female had a body size nearly twice
            that of the smallest one. However, this variation in body size of ovigerous females
            appears to be common in brachyuran crabs. and both reported a wide range of size
            variation among ovigerous females of nine species of <tp:taxon-name> Cancer (Cancridae)
            </tp:taxon-name> . suggested that temperature, food quality and genotypic diOEerences
            may be responsible for variation in size at the onset of egg production. Alternatively,
            variation in size of ovigerous crabs may re ect a determinate growth pattern with
            multiple post-puberty moults in female crabs. reported an inde nite post-puberty
            moulting pattern in the brachyuran families <tp:taxon-name>Cancridae</tp:taxon-name> ,
               <tp:taxon-name>Grapsidae</tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>Ocypodidae</tp:taxon-name>
            , and <tp:taxon-name>Xanthidae</tp:taxon-name> . He suggested that this reproductive
            pattern may allow egg production initiated at a small size to oOEset the risk of
            reproductive failure due to early mortality. </p>
         <p> In comparison to other members of the genus <tp:taxon-name> Pinnotheres
            </tp:taxon-name> or related species (e.g. <tp:taxon-name> P . pisum </tp:taxon-name> and
               <tp:taxon-name> Zaops ostreum </tp:taxon-name> ), the body size of sexually mature
            female <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> is relatively small, but it
            produces similar size eggs (approximately 300 m m) ( ; Christensen and McD ermott,
            1958). It should thus not be surprising that a female of <tp:taxon-name> P . bidentatus
            </tp:taxon-name> produces only 192–1800 eggs per brood, whereas related species (e.g.
               <tp:taxon-name> Z . ostreum </tp:taxon-name> ) can produce over 5000 eggs per brood
            (Christensen and McD ermott, 1958). However, the general rule for size correlation
            between fecundity and size of the female in brachyuran crabs holds for <tp:taxon-name> P
               . bidentatus </tp:taxon-name> , i.e. the larger the female body size, the greater
            fecundity per brood (H ines, 1982, 1991, 1992; H artnoll, 1985; ; M acD iarmid, 1989).
