         <p>The fastest gait and speed of the largest theropod (carnivorous) dinosaurs, such as<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
is controversial. Some studies contend that<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
was limited to walking, or at best an 
11 m

– 
7. We demonstrate a method of gauging running ability by estimating the minimum mass of extensor (supportive) muscle needed for fast running. The model’s predictions are validated for living alligators and chickens. Applying the method to small dinosaurs corroborates other studies by showing that they could have been competent runners. However, models show that in order to run quickly, an adult<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>would have needed an unreasonably large mass of extensor muscle, even with generous assumptions. Therefore, it is doubtful that<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>and other huge dinosaurs (
, 
6,000 kg
) were capable runners or could reach high speeds.

Most assessments of running ability in large theropods are qualitative, based on analogies to walking elephants or running birds and hoofed mammals

. Earlier quantitative assessments of the biomechanics of 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
suggested that it had limited locomotor performance

            <p>
For extant animals, our results (
Table 1
) matched reality: alligators cannot run bipedally, whereas chickens are adept runners. Our dissected 
<tp:taxon-name>Alligator</tp:taxon-name>
only had about 3.6% 
mbody
per leg as extensor muscles, but we estimated that it would need about 7.7% 
mbody
per leg to run quickly on its hindlimbs. In contrast, our 
<tp:taxon-name>Gallus</tp:taxon-name>
specimen had about 8.8% 
mbody
per leg as extensor muscles, but it should only need about 4.7% 
mbody
per leg for fast running. Thus alligators have less than half the extensor muscle they would need to run fast, whereas chickens have almost twice the required amount of extensor muscle.
</p>
            <p>
Well known scaling principles 
12
– 
14
predict that animals of larger body mass (
mbody
) have more restricted locomotor performance because muscle force scales as (
mbody
) 
0.67
, whereas muscle mass scales as (
mbody
) 
1.0
. To be a fast runner, a 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
would have needed enough extensor muscle mass to support itself. We calculated (

; Methods) this mass for various animals to determine whether running would require too much muscle mass.
</p>
            <p>
Smaller theropods had lower estimates of minimum extensor muscle mass per leg (
T
) than 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
(
Table 1
), and thus we expect they had a broader range of running performance. We initially calculated (

) that 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
needed about 43% of its body mass as extensor muscles in each leg (86% 
mbody
for both legs) in order to run quickly. This high estimate of 
T
is surprising because our input parameter values were generously weighted towards a low 
T
. These findings suggest that 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
could not run quickly.
</p>
            <p>
A parameter study was then performed to assess the sensitivity of these findings to the values of the assumed parameters. Many of the parameters needed to model the limb mechanics of extinct dinosaurs are uncertain. To test how 
T
was affected by the initial parameters, we entered a range of values and observed how 
T
changed (
Table 2
). Some unknown parameters, such as the muscle fibre pennation angle (v), were relatively unimportant: within a reasonable range of values (compared to extant taxa) they had little or no effect. Likewise, our approximations of the muscle moment arms (
r
) were presumably reliable because we used rigorous muscle reconstructions that minimize speculation 
15
, 
16
. Although 
mbody
is unknown for extinct taxa, our calculation expressed the required extensor muscle mass as a percentage of body mass (
T
), factoring out 
mbody
(see Methods).
</p>
            <p>
In contrast, uncertainty about other parameter values was quite important. The limb orientation used (

and 

) was a critical assumption because a more columnar (straight­legged) orientation (
Table 2
) decreased the moment arms (
R
) of the ground reaction force (GRF) and hence decreased 
T
compared to a more crouched (bent­legged) limb orientation. A more posterior position of the trunk centre of mass, shorter extensor muscle fibre lengths (
L
), greater extensor muscle moment arms (
r
), or a lower multiplier (
G
) of the GRF would also decrease our estimated values of 
T
(
Table 2
). The relative lengths of muscle fibres (
L
) vary widely in extant taxa 
17
, 
18
, so this parameter deserves more study. Admittedly, our calculations omitted other parameters that a more realistic model could include (Supplementary Information). However, most of these assumptions were conservative, leading to an underestimate of 
T
.

We asked how much hindlimb muscle mass would be unreasonable for an extinct theropod dinosaur: in extant tetrapods, 50% or less of 
mbody
is typically composed of muscle 
19
. This proportion is independent of 
mbody
(ref. 20). Of that 50%, a total of 5–40% of 
mbody
is allocated to limb extensor muscles 
15,17–19
. Considering these data, the simplest inference is that if 
T
is greater than 25% 
mbody
per leg as limb extensors (that is, more than 50% 
mbody
), a biped could not run quickly (if at all), because it would not have enough muscle to exert the necessary forces.
</p>
            <p>
Values given are for all four limb joints (hip,knee,ankle,toe). 
Mmusc
is the muscle moment required to maintain static equilibrium during single limb support at mid­stance of fast running (with G 2:5); L is mean muscle fibre length; v is mean extensor muscle fibre pennation angle; r is mean extensor muscle moment arm (means were weighted by physiological cross­sectional area as in refs 12–14); 
mi
is the percentage of 
mbody
needed as extensor muscles about one joint; T is the total percentage of 
mbody
per leg needed as extensor muscle (sum of all four 
mi
values).
</p>
            <p>
The 
Mmusc
shown is an extensor moment if it is positive, flexor if negative; except at the knee where the converse is true. In the 
<tp:taxon-name>Alligator</tp:taxon-name>
model, the knee joint 
mi
was set at 0 because the knee 
Mmusc
was a flexor moment and we conservatively assumed that two­joint hip extensors and knee flexors (for example M. caudofemoralis longus) could stabilize both joints. See Supplementary Information for more details.
</p>
            <p>
Judging from extant taxa, values of 
T
from 5–25% per leg indicate that an animal may or may not be a fast runner, depending on the ratio of the actual percentage of 
mbody
that is extensor muscle to 
T
, the estimated percentage of extensor muscle required. Values of 
T
closer to 25% probably indicate poor running ability (if any) because the ratio of actual extensor muscle percentage to 
T
would be perilously close to 1. Adept runners (such as ground birds 
12
, 
21
) have 
T
values below 5%, maintaining a high ratio of actual extensor muscle mass to 
T
(almost 2.0 in 
<tp:taxon-name>Gallus</tp:taxon-name>
). This allows the musculoskeletal system to operate with a generous margin of safety 
12
– 
14
to accommodate unexpected increases of joint moments.
</p>
            <p>
Some robust conclusions are possible despite the uncertainties about parameter values. Our findings agree with data from fossilized footprints (fastest estimated speeds are, 
11 m
s 
­1
) 
9
, 
10
indicating that smaller theropods could run quickly. Although our 
T
estimates are somewhat high (10–21% 
mbody
per leg), a more columnar limb orientation could easily have reduced 
T
enough to enable fast running (,5% 
mbody
).
</p>
            <p>
Yet our estimates of 
T
for an adult 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
were so high that it is difficult to justify the reconstruction of 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
as a fast runner. Even with generous assumptions we were unable to reduce the estimates of 
T
to 5% 
mbody
per leg or less. Indeed, scaling data 
17
, 
18
suggest that a 
6,000 kg<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
had only 7–10% 
mbody
per leg as extensors. Therefore we conclude that an adult 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
had very limited, if any, running ability. Our best estimates indicate that an adult 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
needed over 40% 
mbody
per leg as extensor muscle. If this is correct, then such animals were unable to run at all. If 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
was indeed an adept runner, then it must have had many musculoskeletal specializations that available data do not suggest.
</p>
            <p>A
final model is illustrative. We isometrically scaled­up our chicken model to 
6,000 kg
to simulate a 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
­sized chicken. Our model shows that a gigantic chicken, using the same limb orientation as an extant galliform 
21
, would need 99% 
mbody
per leg as extensor muscles to run quickly, which is clearly impossible and is much higher than for a typical chicken (4.7% 
mbody
per leg). Features such as the more posterior position of the trunk centre of mass of 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
explain why we obtained lower estimates of 
T
for 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
(43% 
mbody
per leg) than for the 
6,000 kg
chicken. Nonetheless, the high estimated values of 
T
in both models reveal how giant terrestrial animals become restricted from extreme locomotor performance

The ‘giant chicken’ example naturally prompts one to look at equation (1) in terms of scaling. Assuming isometric scaling, and that muscle pennation (v) and stress (j) are independent of body mass 
13
, 
17
, 
18
, 
22
, we predict that 
T
increases linearly with increasing size (

). We expect 
T
to increase with mass roughly in the manner shown by the dashed curve in 

, especially if limb orientation remains quite flexed.
</p>
            <p>
Our conclusions lead us to question the reconstructions of 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
running at 
11–20 m
s 
­1
(refs 3–8). Even at a lower running speed of 
11 m
s 
­1
(refs 3, 4, 8), an adult 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
would have been near or above its maximum muscular capacity. 
A
walking tyrannosaur could have adopted more extended limb joints to lower the GRF moment arms (
R
) and used double limb support to reduce the GRF, decreasing the 
T
required for walking within reasonable bounds (
Table 2
: models Trex_4 and Trex_lowest). However, our calculations suggest that even a walking tyrannosaur required activation of a large fraction of its extensor muscle volume, at considerable metabolic expense.
</p>
            <p>
This shows the effect on the estimate of T (relative to model Trex_1) when we changed limb orientation (models Trex_2­4) or muscle­fibre lengths (model Trex_Lgator and Trex_Lchick, isometrically scaling up L from 
<tp:taxon-name>Alligator</tp:taxon-name>
(5.91 kg) and 
<tp:taxon-name>Gallus</tp:taxon-name>
(2.89 kg) to 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
(6,000 kg). As with 
<tp:taxon-name>Alligator</tp:taxon-name>
(
Table 1
), models Trex_3, Trex_4, and Trex_lowest had a flexor 
Mmusc
about the knee joint, so the knee 
mi
was conservatively set at 0. Model Trex_lowest shows a combination of parameter values (L from model Trex_Lgator, limb orientation from model Trex_4, and v set at 08) that brought T to its lowest estimated value (see Supplementary Information).
</p>
            <p>
These conclusions should apply to all larger dinosaurs, invalidating arguments that tyrannosaurs were too slow to prey on large contemporaries 
3
such as 
<tp:taxon-name>Triceratops</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
shows the most extreme cursorial (that is, locomotion­related) specializations of larger theropods 
5
– 
9
, but even it was probably a slow runner, at best. Therefore we infer that the numerous lineages of theropod dinosaurs that evolved enormous sizes 
9
independently reduced their running ability. Conversely, reduction of body size and relative increases of extensor muscle sizes and moment arms probably increased running ability in maniraptoran theropods, especially birds 
15
, 
16
. 
Methods</p>
            <p>
The minimum mass of muscle (
mi
) required to produce the joint moment 
Mmusc
to maintain static equilibrium about any joint 
i
is a function of the muscle density (
d
), multiplied by the volume (
V
), divided by the fraction of active muscle volume (
c
). 
V
is equal to the muscle fibre length (
L
), times the cross­sectional area (
A
), divided by the cosine of the pennation angle of the muscle fibres (cosv) 
12–14
. Furthermore, 
A
is equal to the muscle force (
F
) divided by the stress (j). Finally, 
F
must be the 
Mmusc
required to stabilize each joint,divided by the mean extensor muscle moment arm (
r
) 
12–14
. Combining these expressions to solve for the extensor muscle mass required to act about a particular joint 
i
(
mi
; expressed as a percentage of body mass, 
mbody
) produces:
</p>
            <p>mi
100 
M
musc 
Ld
= j 
crm
body cosv 1
</p>
            <p>
These parameters do not depend greatly on the physiology of the animal 
22
, so the equation holds for both warm­ and cold­blooded animals.

               <title>
Estimating the joint moment 
Mmusc</title>
               <p>
In order to estimate 
Mmusc
(and hence 
mi
), we used MATLAB (The Mathworks) software to compute the joint moments needed to maintain static equilibrium in a particular limb orientation. To maintain equilibrium, muscles must exert net muscle moments about joints that balance equal and opposite moments incurred by external and internal forces, such as the ground reaction force (GRF) and segment weights (
Wb
, 
Wt
, 
Ws
and 
Wm
in 

). These moments can be calculated in two dimensions by drawing a set of free­body diagrams and applying the three equilibrium equations (
SFx
0, 
SFy
0, 
SM
0).
</p>
               <p>
This procedure is appropriate for standing, and we explain below how it can be applied to running. We summed 
mi
for all four limb joints to estimate 
T
, the total extensor muscle mass required per leg, as a percentage of 
mbody
.
</p>
            </sec>
            <p>
Choosing 
G</p>
            <p>
We multiplied the 
GRF
magnitude in the free­body diagram analysis by a factor 
G
, the ratio of the 
GRF
to body weight (
mbodyg
, with 
g
9: 
81 m
s 
22
), to estimate the 
Mmusc
needed to support the body on one leg at mid­stance of fast running. At mid­stance of running, the body centre of mass is at its lowest point accelerating upwards, but inertial moments are miniscule relative to the moments of the 
GRF
,so mid­stance is approximated as quasi­static 
12–14,23
. The value of 
G
was set at 2.5, which is a reasonable value for fast running or hopping bipeds 
12–14,24,25
.
</p>
            <p>Determining forward velocity</p>
            <p>
To determine an approximate forward velocity that would be consistent with 
G
2:5 for 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
, we can use the notion of dynamic similarity, such as the Froude number (Fr), the ratio of centripetal to gravitational forces 
26
, calculated as Fr
</p>
            <p>
velocity
2
= hip height 

3 
g
. Our value of 
G
2:5 for 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
high­speed running is comparable to the value (
G
2:7) estimated for an ostrich 
27
running at 
12 m
s 
­1
with Fr 16. For 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
(hip height is roughly 2.5 m), Fr 16 implies an average forward speed of almost 
20m
s 
­1
. Therefore our model assumes a GRF magnitude consistent with the faster estimates of 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus</tp:taxon-name>
running speed 
5–7
. In theory, at
</p>
            <p>
Fr. 1, an animal should switch from a walk to a run 
26
. Consequently the maximum walking speed that an adult tyrannosaur might have used was roughly 
5 m
s 
­1
(
11 m
.

p.h.), which is still faster than speed estimates from known tracks of large theropods 
9
.
</p>
            <p>Model parameters</p>
            <p>
To reconstruct running mechanics in extinct dinosaurs, we modelled a small adult theropod (
Coelophysis
), a small juvenile tyrannosaur, and an adult 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyrannosaurus
(Supplementary Information)
</tp:taxon-name>
. Functional segment lengths (distances between centres of joint rotation), masses,and centres of mass were measured from dissections for the extant taxa, or approximated for the extinct taxa.Hip, knee, ankle and toe joints connected these segments and were given joint angles.These parameters (see Supplementary Information) were used in a free­body diagram analysis (

) to calculate 
Mmusc
for equation (1).
</p>
            <p>
We entered other parameter values (
Table 1
) into equation (1) to estimate 
T
. The values of 
L
, v and 
r
were measured from dissections for the extant taxa, or approximated for the extinct taxa. The muscle density (
d
) was set at 1:06 3 10 
3 kg
m23 as in typical skeletal muscle 
28
, and the muscle stress (j) was entered as 3:00 
3 10 5 N
m22, the maximum isometric stress frequently measured 
22
. Because we were estimating the minimum mass of muscle required to produce 
M
musc, we set the fraction of active muscle volume (
c
) at 1. Muscle moment arms (
r
) were estimated for extinct taxa by applying muscle reconstructions 
15
, 
16
to skeletal material, at appropriate joint angles.
</p>
            <p>T constraints</p>
            <p>
The ratio of actual extensor muscle mass to 
T
, the required mass (both terms as a percentage of 
m
body) must be at least 1 for a bipedal animal to be able to run quickly; otherwise the actual muscles would be unable to generate the required forces. For extinct animals, we cannot measure the actual muscle masses, but as the estimated 
T
increases, good running performance becomes increasingly unlikely.If 
T
is more than 50% 
m
body per leg (100% 
m
body total), running at Fr 16 is certainly impossible.
