The presence of the sisorid catfish genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Erethistoides</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Myanmar
, represented by three new species, is recorded for the first time. This discovery from the Irrawaddy and Sittang river drainages from central 
Myanmar
and the Ann Chaung River drainage in western 
Myanmar
extends the documented range of the genus beyond the Ganges/Brahmaputra River basin. 
<tp:taxon-name>Erethistoides longispinis</tp:taxon-name>
is distinguished from congeners in having the following unique combination of characters: length of the dorsal-fin spine 
24–27
% 
SL
, length of the pectoral-fin spine 
29–35
% 
SL
, and absence of proximally-directed serrations on the anterior edge of the pectoral spine. 
<tp:taxon-name>Erethistoides luteolus</tp:taxon-name>
differs from congeners in having the following combination of characters: yellow base color of the body, body with distinct bands, vertebrae 
30
, premaxillary tooth band partially exposed when the mouth is closed, length of the dorsal-fin spine 
14–15
% 
SL
, length of the pectoral-fin spine

         <p>
Fishes of the sisorid catfish genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Erethistoides</tp:taxon-name>
have, until now, been known only from the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna river basins of South Asia (Ng, 
2006
; 

Tamang et al., 
2008
). Six species were treated as valid in Ng (
2006
) and 

Ferraris (
2007
)

, and 

Tamang et al. (
2008
)

recently described one additional species. Herein, we report on the discovery of three species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Erethistoides</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Myanmar
. These species, which come from the Irrawaddy, Sittang and Ann Chaung river basins, represent the first reports of the genus from east of the Brahmaputra River basin, as well as the only specimens known from 
Myanmar
.

Measurements were made point to point with dial calipers and data recorded to tenths of a millimeter. Counts were made on the left side of specimens whenever possible. Subunits of the head are presented as proportions of head length (HL). Head length and measurements of body parts are given as proportions of standard length (
SL
). Measurements follow those of Ng &amp; Dodson (
1999
). An asterisk following a meristic count (if present) indicates the value for the 
holotype
. Osteological data was obtained from radiographs.

            <p>Habitat.
This species was collected over sand and fine gravel substrates, in areas of moderate current up to approximately 
2 m
in depth. Collections at two stations (
CAS229020
and 
229021
) used a 
3
-m mini-Missouri trawl (

Herzog et al. 
2005
) to sample deeper runs; other stations were primarily collected by seines or cast nets.
</p>
         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="etymology">
            <p>Etymology
. The specific epithet comes from the Latin adjective longus, meaning long, and the noun spina, meaning a thorn. The name is used in reference to the relatively long dorsal spine of this species when compared to congeners.

150
river kilometers upstream of the mouth have a shorter pectoral fin than the rest of the 
type

            <p>Habitat.
This species was collected over sand and fine gravel substrates, in areas of moderate current up to approximately 
2 m
in depth. Collections at two stations (
CAS229020
and 
229021
) used a 
3
-m mini-Missouri trawl (

Herzog et al. 
2005
) to sample deeper runs; other stations were primarily collected by seines or cast nets.

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="etymology">
            <p>Etymology
. The specific epithet comes from the Latin adjective longus, meaning long, and the noun spina, meaning a thorn. The name is used in reference to the relatively long dorsal spine of this species when compared to congeners.

The two

150
river kilometers upstream of the mouth have a shorter pectoral fin than the rest of the 
type

            <p>Habitat.
This species was collected over sand and fine gravel substrates, in areas of moderate current up to approximately 
2 m
in depth. Collections at two stations (
CAS229020
and 
229021
) used a 
3

Herzog et al. 
2005
) to sample deeper runs; other stations were primarily collected by seines or cast nets.

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="etymology">
            <p>Etymology
. The specific epithet comes from the Latin adjective longus, meaning long, and the noun spina, meaning a thorn. The name is used in reference to the relatively long dorsal spine of this species when compared to congeners.

150
river kilometers upstream of the mouth have a shorter pectoral fin than the rest of the 
type

</p>
            <p>Coloration.
In 
70
% ethanol: dorsal and lateral surfaces of head and body in front of and at level of dorsal fin brown, color somewhat unevenly distributed; tubercles along anterior part of lateral line cream. Snout with dusky appearance imparted by cream base color overlain by melanophores. All ventral surfaces of head and body cream. Dorsal and lateral surfaces of body posterior to dorsal fin cream, with scattered melanophores imparting dusky appearance. Two brown vertical blotches on body extending almost to ventral midline: first immediately ventral to adipose-fin base and second at posterior half of caudal peduncle. Dorsal fin dusky brown, caused by irregular distribution of melanophores on fin rays and fin membranes. Pectoral fin with basal third hyaline and broad subdistal brown band. Pelvic fin hyaline, with thin brown band in middle third of fin. Anal fin hyaline with broad brown band in middle third of fin. Caudal fin hyaline, with broad irregular transverse brown band subdistally. All barbels cream.

            <p>Habitat.
This species was collected over sand and fine gravel substrates, in areas of moderate current up to approximately 
2 m
in depth. Collections at two stations (
CAS229020
and 
229021
) used a 
3
-m mini-Missouri trawl (

Herzog et al. 
2005
) to sample deeper runs; other stations were primarily collected by seines or cast nets.

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="etymology">
            <p>Etymology
. The specific epithet comes from the Latin adjective longus, meaning long, and the noun spina, meaning a thorn. The name is used in reference to the relatively long dorsal spine of this species when compared to congeners.

150
river kilometers upstream of the mouth have a shorter pectoral fin than the rest of the 
type
series collected from the Chindwin near the mouth (

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>
Among sisorids, species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Erethistoides</tp:taxon-name>
are most readily recognized by having a strongly depressed snout as well as a unique arrangement of serrations along the leading margin of the pectoral-fin spine. Serrations along the basal portion of the spine are directed proximally or perpendicular to the spine axis, while those of the distal part of the spine are angled towards the spine tip. The divergent pattern of the spines is most clearly seen in species with comparatively large serrations (
<tp:taxon-name>E. ascita</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>E. cavatura</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>E. montana</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>E. pipri</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>E. sicula</tp:taxon-name>
), but is nonetheless evident in all species. Additional evidence for the assignment of the three species to 
<tp:taxon-name>Erethistoides</tp:taxon-name>
is based on the presence of the synapomorphies diagnosing the genus as described in Ng (
2006
), viz. the neural spines of the first eight post-Weberian vertebrae strongly depressed, inflected posteriorly, and positioned in a groove formed by the base of the neural spines of the vertebrae immediately posterior and an enlarged maxilla that is almost as long as the palatine.
</p>
         <p>
The discovery of 
<tp:taxon-name>Erethistoides</tp:taxon-name>
from three river drainages to the east of the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system represents a significant range extension for the genus. The fact that three unnamed species were found in river drainages not previously believed to harbor members of this genus demonstrate the paucity of our knowledge of sisorid diversity (as well as the diversity of 
Myanmar
freshwater fishes). Despite recent efforts to fully document this diversity (

Thomson &amp; Page, 
2006
), as well as to understand phylogenetic relationships within the family (Ng, 
2010
; Jiang et al., 
2011
), it appears that we are far from fully understanding the diversity of the group.
