is characterized by having seven pairs of elongate, apically pointed gills. At least gills I and II are very slender with strongly extended points, which is unique in 
<tp:taxon-name>Baetidae</tp:taxon-name>
. Similar gills were described from 
<tp:taxon-name>Leptophlebiidae</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>Procerobaetis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
is further characterized by having long, slender legs with extended, slender and slightly bent claws. The antennae posess remarkable spines at the outer, lateral margin, which are maximally developed on segments IX–XI of the flagellum. No spines are present on the posterior margins of abdominal tergites I–VI. COI sequences were obtained from all three of the new species. The genetic distances (Kimura 2-parameter) between these species are between 13% and 20%. Very limited genetic distances of 0% to 1% were found between specimens of the same species. The occurrence of two different species in the same area of Sumatra is discussed.

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>
The family 
<tp:taxon-name>Baetidae</tp:taxon-name>
has the highest species diversity among mayflies, comprising 1070 species in 110 genera (
Sartori &amp; Brittain 2015
; 

Jacobus 
et al.
2019

), which is about 30% of all mayfly species worldwide (

Jacobus 
et al.
2019

). They have a cosmopolitan distribution, except in 
Antarctica
and 
New Zealand
. Investigations of the molecular phylogeny of the Order 
<tp:taxon-name>Ephemeroptera</tp:taxon-name>
have revealed the relatively primitive status of the family (Ogden &amp; Whiting 2005; 

Ogden 
et al.
2009

). The generic diversity of 
<tp:taxon-name>Baetidae</tp:taxon-name>
is the highest in the Afrotropical (about 40 genera), followed by the Neotropical (about 27 genera) and Oriental (26 genera) realms and finally the Nearctic (20 genera), Palaearctic (17 genera) and the Australasian (about 12 genera) realms (
Gattolliat &amp; Nieto 2009
; 
Gattolliat 2012
). The number for the Oriental realm seems to be rather low considering that regions with potentially high diversities (i.e., the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia) belong to this realm. For example, intensive sampling in an area of only 
85 km2
on the island Borneo (
Indonesia
, 
East Kalimantan
) revealed the occurence of 12 different genera of 
<tp:taxon-name>Baetidae</tp:taxon-name>
, some of them undescribed (

Sartori 
et al.
2003

). This could be attributed to a relatively low mayfly research output in the Oriental realm over a long period. Apart from 
Sri Lanka
, 
Taiwan
and 
Hong Kong
, most of the Oriental realm has remained very poorly known (
Gattolliat &amp; Nieto 2009
), even to date. The last two new genera of 
<tp:taxon-name>Baetidae</tp:taxon-name>
from the Oriental region were described in 2012 from Borneo (
Gattolliat 2012
).
</p>
         <p>
Here we describe a new genus from Southeast Asia, based on material collected by Morgan Gueuning (University of 
Neuchatel
, 
Switzerland
; 

Gueuning 
et al.
2017

) in 
Indonesia
and on the collection stored in the Biodiversity Laboratory headed by Hendrik Freitag (Ateneo de 
Manila
University, 
Philippines
) in the 
Philippines
.
</p>
         <p>Indonesia
is an immense archipelago of more than 18 000 islands extending over 
5000 km
from 
95° E
to 
141° E
and from 
6° N
to 
11° S
. It is one of the most biologically rich countries in the world. The high levels of species richness and endemism are mainly attributable to a complex geological history, that brought together two different biological realms (the Oriental and Australasian), separated by a transitional region (Wallacea) (
Kingston 2010
; 
Hall 2010
). The main islands are 
Sumatra
, 
Java
, Borneo (partly, 
Kalimantan Province
), 
Sulawesi
and New 
Guinea
(partly, provinces 
West Papua
and 
Papua
). Further there are large island groups like the 
Lesser Sunda Islands
, the 
Moluccas
and the Banda Islands.
</p>
         <p>
Similarly, the 
Philippines
is a complex archipelago with more than 7500 islands, spanning the Asian- Australian faunal zone interface directly at the Wallace Line. The Huxley’s Line/Filter Zone divides the country into 
Palawan
and associated islands, the presumed former land bridge to Northern Borneo, from the older land masses Mindoro, 
Romblon
and Panay, and the truly oceanic islands of the 
Philippines
. It has an extraordinary biodiversity, presumably supported by ancient land mass movements, environmental gradients along steep volcanic slopes and alterations of connectivity between neighboring islands due to sea-level regressions (
Brown &amp; Diesmos 2010
; 

Freitag 
et al.
2016

).
</p>
         <p>
Further collections of 
<tp:taxon-name>Ephemeroptera</tp:taxon-name>
, especially of 
<tp:taxon-name>Baetidae</tp:taxon-name>
, in Southeast Asia will unveil more unknown genera and many more species in the future.

The specimens from Sumatra and the 
Philippines
were collected by Morgan Gueuning (University of 
Neuchâtel
, 
Switzerland
) and Jhoana Garces (Biodiversity Laboratory, Ateneo de 
Manila
University, 
Philippines
), respectively.
</p>
         <p>Specimens were preserved in 70–96% ethanol. Larval dissection was carried out in Cellosolve (2-ethoxyethanol) with subsequent mounting on slides with Euparal liquid, using an Olympus SZX7 stereo microscope.</p>
         <p>
The DNA of part of the specimens was extracted using non-destructive methods, allowing subsequent morphological analysis (see 

Vuataz 
et al.
2011

for details). We amplified a 658 bp fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) using the primers LCO 1490 (GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG) and HCO 2198 (TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA) (

Folmer 
et al.
1994

). The PCR temperature progression was set as: 30 s at 98°C; 10 s at 98°C, 30 s at 50°C, 30 s at 72°C (× 37 cycles); 120 s at 72°C. Sequencing was done with Sanger’s method (

Sanger 
et al.
1977

). The genetic variability between specimens was estimated using Kimura-2- parameter distances (K2P, 
Kimura 1980
), calculated with the program MEGA 7 (

Kumar 
et al.
2016

, http://www.megasoftware.net). The GenBank accession numbers are given in

         <p>Drawings were made using an Olympus BX43 microscope. Photographs of larvae were taken using a Canon EOS 6D camera and the Visionary Digital Passport imaging system (http://www.duninc.com) and processed with the programs Adobe Photoshop Lightroom (http://www.adobe.com) and Helicon Focus ver. 5.3 (http://www.heliconsoft.com). Photographs were subsequently enhanced with Adobe Photoshop Elements ver. 13.</p>
         <p>
The distribution maps were generated with the program SimpleMappr (https://simplemappr.net,

); B) base of antennae close to each other, with carina between them (

); C) antenna without process on scape, with spines on apex of flagellum segments, maximally expressed on flagellum segment IX (

); D) labrum on dorsal surface with many long, stout, simple setae, erratically distributed, not arranged in one arc (

); E) right mandible with a row of thin setae at inner margin of innermost denticle, a simple stick-like, apicolaterally pectinate prostheca and a row of long, stout setae between prostheca and mola (

B–C); F) left mandible with a row of short, stout setae and minute denticles between prostheca and mola, both directed toward subtriangular process, no setae at apex of mola (

); G) hypopharynx with a medial tuft of stout setae (

            <p>
The specimens were collected at altitudes from 
800 to 1100 m
a.s.l. in medium to large, mainly shallow and slow to moderate fast streams (width 
2–10 m
, depth 
20–150 cm
, velocity 
0.28–0.5 m
/s, temperature 20–21°C, pH 7–7.5). The streams were mostly in forests with a partly closed canopy, the substrate was dominated by bedrock, boulders and stones with few patches of leaf litter or dead wood. One stream was in a more disturbed area (rice fields, waste and soap).

            <p>
The specimens were collected at altitudes from 
800 to 1100 m
a.s.l. in medium to large, mainly shallow and slow to moderate fast streams (width 
2–10 m
, depth 
20–150 cm
, velocity 
0.28–0.5 m
/s, temperature 20–21°C, pH 7–7.5). The streams were mostly in forests with a partly closed canopy, the substrate was dominated by bedrock, boulders and stones with few patches of leaf litter or dead wood. One stream was in a more disturbed area (rice fields, waste and soap).

            <p>
The specimens were collected at altitudes from 
800 to 1100 m
a.s.l. in medium to large, mainly shallow and slow to moderate fast streams (width 
2–10 m
, depth 
20–150 cm
, velocity 
0.28–0.5 m
/s, temperature 20–21°C, pH 7–7.5). The streams were mostly in forests with a partly closed canopy, the substrate was dominated by bedrock, boulders and stones with few patches of leaf litter or dead wood. One stream was in a more disturbed area (rice fields, waste and soap).

lepto
– derived from the Greek word ʻleptosʼ, meaning ʻfineʼ, ʻthinʼ, ʻslenderʼ – and 
branchius
, derived from the Latin word branchiae, meaning ʻgillsʼ, in reference to the remarkably elongate and long-pointed gills I and II, which are typical for the genus. It is also in reference to

type
of gill partly exists as well.

obviously belongs to the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Baetidae</tp:taxon-name>
based on the developing turban eyes of late instar male larvae (

C–D, 13A–B), the long, slender, pisciform body shape, the larval Y-shaped frontal suture reaching ventrally of the lateral ocelli (

), the labrum with distinctly expressed median incision, the shape of the left and right prostheca, the largely fused outer and inner sets of denticles of both mandibles, the shape of the glossae (basally widened, most part narrow) and the anterior outer projection of the femur apex, which is directed toward the inner side of the femur (
Wang &amp; McCafferty 1996
; 
Kluge 2004
; 
Kluge &amp; Novikova 2011
). It further belongs to the subfamily Baetinae 
sensuKazlauskas (1972)
and more specifically to the non- 
<tp:taxon-name>Baetis</tp:taxon-name>
complex of Baetinae (

Waltz 
et al.
1994

; 
Waltz &amp; McCafferty 1997
), also referred to as Baetungulata-non-Baetofemorata (
Kluge &amp; Novikova 2011
), because of the claw with one row of denticles on the inner-anterior side and the lack of a femoral patch. However, 
<tp:taxon-name>Procerobaetis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
has a 3-segmented maxillary palp, contrary to most Baetinae. The third segment is always rather short and the separation from the second segment is not always completely visible (

, 

, 

); it therefore could be a recent, secondary division of segment II. Similar 3-segmented maxillary palps are also present in two species of 
<tp:taxon-name>LabiobaetisNovikova &amp; Kluge, 1987</tp:taxon-name>
, from 
Indonesia
(
Kaltenbach &amp; Gattolliat 2019

is closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>Nigrobaetis
Kazlauskas in 
Novikova &amp; Kluge, 1987</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>AlainitesWaltz &amp; McCafferty, 1994</tp:taxon-name>
. They share the typical rounded, involute appearance of the head and thorax in lateral view, the labium, including the shape of the glossae and paraglossae and the labial palp with a very small distolateral extension of segment II, and the labrum with long, stout, simple setae on the dorsal surface, which are erratically distributed and not arranged in an arc (
Müller-Liebenau 1984

). 
<tp:taxon-name>Nigrobaetis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Alainites</tp:taxon-name>
are different by the shape of the gills, which are oval to elongate oval, whereas 
<tp:taxon-name>Procerobaetis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
is characterized by very slender, elongate gills with pronounced points and with a very long, extended apex at least in gills I and II (

B–H, 10B–H). This shape of gills I and II is an apomorphy, which is unique in 
<tp:taxon-name>Baetidae</tp:taxon-name>
. However, similar gills are known from 
<tp:taxon-name>Leptophlebiidae</tp:taxon-name>
as well (
Peters &amp; Edmunds 1964
, 
1970
). Furthermore, 
<tp:taxon-name>Alainites</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Nigrobaetis</tp:taxon-name>
can be distinguished by the 2-segmented maxillary palp, the absence of a medial tuft of stout, long setae on the hypopharynx, the absence of laterally pectinate setae on the legs, the shape of the claws (more extended and only slightly bent in 
<tp:taxon-name>Procerobaetis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
) and the presence of spines at the distal margin of abdominal tergite IV (
Müller-Liebenau 1984
, 
1985
; 

Kang 
et al.
1994

; 
Gattolliat 2004
; 

Gattolliat 
et al.
2012

; 

Zrelli 
et al.
2012

). Additionally, 
<tp:taxon-name>Alainites</tp:taxon-name>
is different from 
<tp:taxon-name>Procerobaetis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
by the bifurcate left prostheca and the presence of a pronounced prolongation on the posterior side of the paraproct (Müller- Liebenau 1984; 

Zrelli 
et al.
2012

), and 
<tp:taxon-name>Nigrobaetis</tp:taxon-name>
is different by the shape of the left prostheca (more stout, with apical denticles) (
Müller-Liebenau 1984
; 
Gattolliat 2004
; 

Gattolliat 
et al.
2012

). Recently, 
<tp:taxon-name>Alainites</tp:taxon-name>
was tentatively synonymized with 
<tp:taxon-name>TakobiaNovikova &amp; Kluge, 1987</tp:taxon-name>
(
Kluge &amp; Novikova 2014
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Takobia maxillaris
(Braasch &amp; Soldan, 1983)
</tp:taxon-name>
, the 
type
species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Takobia</tp:taxon-name>
, has a labial palp and right mandible very similar to those of 
<tp:taxon-name>Procerobaetis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
, but differs in many other characters, such as the maxillary palp, the claw without denticles, the tergites with spines at the posterior margin, the spines of the paraproct and the shape of the gills (
Novikova &amp; Kluge 1987
).
</p>
         <p>
Some of the characters of 
<tp:taxon-name>Procerobaetis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
are also present in other, not closely related genera of 
<tp:taxon-name>Baetidae</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>Indocloeon
Müller-Liebenau, 1982
</tp:taxon-name>
has a similar left mandible with a tuft of setae and minute denticles between prostheca and mola, both directed toward the subtriangular process, a tuft of setae between the prostheca and mola of the right mandible, a tuft of stout setae medially on the hypopharynx, and legs with laterally pectinate setae on femur, tibia and tarsus; moreover, 
<tp:taxon-name>Indocloeon spathasetisKaltenbach &amp; Gattolliat, 2017</tp:taxon-name>
has similar spines on the outer lateral margin of the flagellum (
Kluge 2012
; 
Kaltenbach &amp; Gattolliat 2017
). It is distinguished by the labial palp having a distomedial protuberance on segment II, the claw with two rows of denticles, the foreleg lacking a patellotibial suture (Protopatellata), the spines at the posterior margins of the tergites and the shape of the gills (
Kluge 2012
; 
Kaltenbach &amp; Gattolliat 2017
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Cheleocloeon
Wuillot &amp; Gillies, 1993
</tp:taxon-name>
shares similar left and right mandibles and the elongate, slender, slightly bent claws. It differs by the two rows of denticles on the claws (in some species extremely reduced or vistigial), the labial palp with a large distomedial protuberance of segment II, the lack of a tuft of stout setae on the hypopharynx, the spines on the posterior margin of the tergites and the shape of the gills (
Lugo-Ortiz &amp; McCafferty 1997
; 
Gattolliat &amp; Sartori 2008
; 
Kluge 2016
).

The genetic distances between the different species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Procerobaetis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
are in an expected range, between 13 and 20 % (K2P, 
Table 4
). 

Ball 
et al.
(2005)

reported a mean interspecific, congeneric distance of 18% for mayflies in the 
USA
and 
Canada
. The intraspecific distances are very low, as expected, ranging from 0 to 1% (K2P). This result is certainly biased, as it is based on two sequenced specimens per species from a single population.
</p>
         <p>
Interestingly, we found two different species, 
<tp:taxon-name>Procerobaetis leptobranchius</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. petersorum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
, in the same area in 
Sumatra
(

). However, they were found on the slopes of two different volcanos, at different elevations and under different ecological conditions. 
<tp:taxon-name>Procerobaetis leptobranchius</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
was collected on the volcano Singgalang at altitudes from 
1600 to 1800
m

a.s.l. (pH 6–7, water temperature 15.5–17°C), while 
<tp:taxon-name>P. petersorum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
was collected on the volcano Sago at altitudes from 
880 to 1100 m
a.s.l. (pH 7–7.5, water temperature 20–21°C). Furthermore, we have a single, small larva of 
<tp:taxon-name>Procerobaetis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
from another neighboring volcano, Marapi, collected at an altitude of 
1400 m
a.s.l. This 
P.
sp. C has a genetic distance of 16% to the other two species from 
Sumatra
, which is clearely in the interspecific range (
Table 4
). We are unable to establish resilient morphological differences between 
P
. sp. C and the other species based on a single small larva; therefore, 
P.
sp. C will remain an undescribed species for now, without further treatment in this paper. However, the occurrence of at least two different species in the same area at different elevations and ecological conditions points to the direction that these factors could be drivers of speciation by radiation. In a recent study of the structuration of the mayfly community in the same area (volcanos Singgalang, Sago and Marapi in 
Sumatra
), elevation was found to be the only factor driving the within-species genetic structuring of two species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Baetidae</tp:taxon-name>
and an important factor for the two others (

Gueuning 
et al.
2017

).
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Procerobaetis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
has a wide distribution across Southeast Asia (
Indonesia
, 
Philippines
). However, our knowledge about 
<tp:taxon-name>Baetidae</tp:taxon-name>
in this region is still poor and no collections were done at all in many areas or habitats. Therefore, we expect more species of this genus in Southeast Asia with further collections in the future.
