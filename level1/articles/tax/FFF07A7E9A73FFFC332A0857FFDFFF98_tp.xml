The large spiny mouse 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys spinosus
(
Thomas, 1882
)
</tp:taxon-name>
has been considered the widest ranging species of the genus, occurring in southern 
Colombia
, eastern 
Peru
, western 
Brazil
and northern 
Bolivia
. The morphological variation between subspecies and populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
has been noted; nonetheless, this variation has not been assessed in a morphological or molecular context. Here, we present a taxonomic revision of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.l.</named-content>
using qualitative and quantitative morphological analyses. These analyses were complemented with molecular analysis to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
, based on sequences of the cytochrome b gene. Our results reveal that 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.l.</named-content>
is a monophyletic group, and morphological and molecular evidence to differentiate three taxa: 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
, an endemic species from mountain cloud forests in 
Peru
; 
<tp:taxon-name>N. amoenus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.l.</named-content>
from the Cerrado between 
Bolivia
and 
Brazil
to the Amazonia between 
Ecuador
and northern 
Peru
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
from mountain cloud forests from southern 
Peru
to 
Bolivia
. Also, our molecular results indicate that 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
is still far from being completely known. For instance, there are three candidate species pending of taxonomic revision. Finally, we propose three species groups within 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
: “ 
<tp:taxon-name>paracou</tp:taxon-name>
”, “ 
<tp:taxon-name>tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
” and “ 
<tp:taxon-name>spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
”, and discuss biogeographical scenarios of the genus within South America.

         <p>
Spiny mice of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>NeacomysThomas, 1900</tp:taxon-name>
are small oryzomyines that externally present grooved spine hairs, reddish to dark brown dorsal fur, contrasting pale ventral fur, a long tail, and large hind feet (

Patton 
et al.
2000

; 

Voss 
et al
. 2001

). This genus is distributed from 
Panama
to northern 
Bolivia
, inhabiting Central American and Amazonian lowlands as well as highlands of montane rainforests of the eastern slope of the Andes in South America (

Patton 
et al.
2000

; 
Weksler &amp; Bonvicino 2015a
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
is currently recognized as a monophyletic group (

Patton 
et al.
2000

; 
Weksler 2006
; 
Catzeflis &amp; Tilak 2009
), composed of eight species (
Weksler &amp; Bonvicino 2015a
). Some evidence, however, suggests that 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
could have a greater diversity than what has currently been documented for this genus (

Patton 
et al.
2000

; 
Catzeflis &amp; Tilak 2009
; 
Hice &amp; Velazco 2012
; da Silva 
et al.
2015).
</p>
         <p>
Recent studies of the systematics and phylogeography of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
have revealed undiscovered diversity in this genus. For instance, 

Patton 
et al.
(2000)

described two new species based on morphological and molecular analyses of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
from the Juruá River basin. These analyses indicated that the other Amazonian populations are molecularly differentiated from Juruá populations as candidate species level. Although the authors suggested that these candidate species could be named 
<tp:taxon-name>N. amoenusThomas, 1903</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>N. carceleniHershkovitz 1940</tp:taxon-name>
, which are current junior synonyms of 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
, these taxa are pending of a taxonomic review. Similarly, Voss 
et al.</p>
         <p>
(2001) described two new species based on the morphological revision of populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>N. guianae
Thomas, 1905
</tp:taxon-name>
from the 
Guyana
Region. 

Patterson 
et al.
(2006)

reported a new species (currently in description; Patterson, in litt.) from the Paucartambo region (
Cusco
) that could be related to 
<tp:taxon-name>N. musseri</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>N. minutus</tp:taxon-name>
. Using molecular data, 
Catzeflis &amp; Tilak (2009)
reported a new candidate species from the 
Amazonas
state of 
Brazil
. While 
Hice &amp; Velazco (2012)
distinguished a candidate species from the western 
Amazonas
basin using morphological data and morphometrics, but it lacks of formal description. All this evidence indicates that the real taxonomic composition of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
has been underestimated, however, more revisions are needed to delineate the taxonomy and distributions of the species.
</p>
         <p>
Within 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
has the widest distribution, from southern 
Colombia
to northern 
Bolivia
and western 
Brazil
. It inhabits the altitudinal gradient present between Amazonia and the Andes spanning Montane, Pre-Montane, and Rain Forests (

Pacheco 
et al.
2009

; 

Pacheco 
et al.
2011

) from 
300 to 1900 m
in elevation (
Leo &amp; Romo 1992
; 

Patton 
et al.
2000

; 
Weksler &amp; Bonvicino 2015a
). This species exhibits great morphological variation; for instance, color of dorsal fur varies from reddish to brown (

Patton 
et al.
2000

; 
Weksler &amp; Bonvicino 2015a
), ventral fur can be from totally white to grayish (
Thomas 1882
; 
Lawrence 1941
; 
Weksler 2006
), tail can be longer than head-body length or they can be same sized (
Lawrence 1941
), metatarsal patch ranges from being a small tenuous spot to broadly extended (
Lawrence 1941
), hind feet being smaller in lowland populations than in highland populations (
Lawrence 1941
), and supraorbital beads of the skull range from moderately developed to strongly developed (
Thomas 1882
; 
Lawrence 1941
).
</p>
         <p>
Taxonomically, four subspecies have been recognized within 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
(
Thomas 1900
; 
Thomas 1903
; 
Hershkovitz 1940
; 
Lawrence 1941
): 
N. s.<tp:taxon-name>tenuipesThomas, 1900</tp:taxon-name>
is found in northern 
Colombia
and is distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
because it presents darker dorsal fur, pure white ventral fur, and shorter and more slender hind feet (
Thomas 1900
); 
<tp:taxon-name>N. s. amoenus</tp:taxon-name>
inhabits Brazilian Cerrado, it is larger than 
<tp:taxon-name>spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
, has a longer tail and braincase, softer and shorter dorsal and ventral fur, and pure white ventral fur (
Thomas 1903
); 
<tp:taxon-name>N. s. carceleni</tp:taxon-name>
is found near the Curaray River in 
Ecuador
and differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
because it has a shorter tail, pure white ventral fur, a longer and heavier braincase, well developed supraorbital ridges, and longer molar rows (
Hershkovitz 1940
); and 
<tp:taxon-name>N. s. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
inhabits along montane cloud forests in 
Peru
, that presents ventral fur with gray bases and large metatarsal patches (
Thomas 1882
, 
Lawrence 1941
). From these subspecies, based on morphological characters alone, 
Lawrence (1941)
considered 
<tp:taxon-name>N. tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
to be a species, retained 
<tp:taxon-name>N. s. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>N. s. carceleni</tp:taxon-name>
as subspecies, but dismissed 
<tp:taxon-name>N. s. amoenus</tp:taxon-name>
from the comparisons entirely. 
<tp:taxon-name>N. tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
is molecularly distinct from other congeners, the support of its phylogenetic relationships among 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
is weak although is supposed to be closer related to Amazonian species (

Patton 
et al.
2000

). On the other hand, based on a bibliographic review, 
Cabrera (1961)
recognized three subspecies, that differ each other in their geographical distributions 
<tp:taxon-name>N. s. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>N. s. amoenus</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>N. s. carceleni</tp:taxon-name>
. Currently, 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
with its subspecies 
<tp:taxon-name>amoenus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>carceleni</tp:taxon-name>
is considered as widely distributed species spreading through geographical barriers and different landscapes (

Honacki 
et al.
1982

; 
Novak &amp; Paradiso 1983
; 
Musser &amp; Carleton 1993
; 
Musser &amp; Carleton 2005
; 

Patton 
et al.
2000

; 

Patton 
et al.
2008

; 
Weksler &amp; Bonvicino 2015a
).
</p>
         <p>
The phylogenetic relationships within 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
have been poorly explored. The phylogenetic reconstruction of sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene suggests that this species is monophyletic (

Patton 
et al.
2000

; 
Catzeflis &amp; Tilak 2009
; da Silva 
et al.
2015). However, this phylogenetic hypothesis was made following incomplete geographical sampling; samples were mainly taken from lowland localities from 
Ecuador
, 
Peru
, and eastern Brazilian Amazonia, lacking samples from the 
type
locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sensu stricto</named-content>
from highlands of the Central Andes or from the southern lowlands of the Cerrado. Thus, the true phylogenetic relationships of 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
and its subspecies remain unresolved until samples from the entire geographic range are included.
</p>
         <p>
Given the evidence of morphological variation among populations and subspecies, we aim to review 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sensu lato</named-content>
in a morphological and molecular context with emphasis on populations from 
Peru
. We aim the diagnosis of 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sensu stricto</named-content>
to propose taxonomic changes and to describe a new species.

We examined a total of 
241 adult
specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
from 85 localities, which partially cover the distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
. Additionally, we also included specimens of

and 
<tp:taxon-name>N. musseri</tp:taxon-name>
, which are co-distributed with 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
, (Appendix I). Specimens used in this study belong in the following museum collections: American Museum of Natural History,

         <p>Populations.
Operational population units were constrained within the following rivers: 
Amazonas
, 
Marañon
, 
Ucayali
, Huallaga, 
Apurimac
, Urubamba and Inambari. Also, they were constrained along the elevation gradient in the oriental slope of the Andes as lowlands (below ~ 
700 m
), premontane forests (~700 to ~ 
1200 m
), and montane forests (above ~ 
1200 m
) (following 
Young &amp; León 1999
).
</p>
         <p>Qualitative analysis.
We used a set of 136 morphological characters scored for each individual. When making comparisons, we considered only those characters that were present in all members of the population and dismissed those with variation among individuals, in order to describe discrete and diagnostic characters (following 
Wiens 2000
criteria). First, we compared specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>N. minutus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>N. musseri</tp:taxon-name>
with populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
. Then, we compared the diagnostic characters of each population within 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
with photos of 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>lectotype
(
BMNH

<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus amoenus</tp:taxon-name>type
(

<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus carceleni</tp:taxon-name>
(
UMMZ

Voss (1991)
. For the description of the skin and skull-dental characters, we followed

         <p>Quantitative analysis.
We took two sets of measurements, external and craniodental. Five external measurements were taken from specimens’ labels as follows: Total length (TL): from the tip of the nose to the tip of the terminal tail vertebra; Tail length (T): from the base of the tail to tip of the last vertebra; Hind foot length (F): from the proximal margin of the calcaneus to the tip of longest claw; Ear height (E): from the notch to top of the pinna; and Weight (W). Eighteen craniodental measurements were taken (precision ± 
0.01 mm
) of 
62 adult
specimens, following 

Patton 
et al.
(2000)

and 

Voss 
et al.
(2001)

: Greatest length of skull (GLS): greatest midline length obtainable from the anterior border of nasal bones to the posterior-most extension of the skull. Condyloincisive Length (CIL): from the greater curvature of one upper incisor to the articular surface of the occipital condyle on the same side. Nasal Length (LN): midline distance from the anterior tip to the posterior border of the nasal bones. Rostral Length (LR): length from the anterior border of the orbit to the midline tip of the nasal bones. Rostral Breadth (BR): breadth of rostrum across nasolacrimal capsule. Zygomatic Breadth (ZB): greatest breadth across zygomatic arches. Breadth of Braincase (BB): greatest transverse dimension across the braincase above and slightly behind the squamosal zygomatic processes. Length of Orbital Foramen (LOF): greatest transverse length from the zygomatic to the squamosal root. Least Interorbital Breadth (
LIB
): shortest distance across the frontal bones between the orbital fossae. Length of Diastema (LD): from the crown of the first cheek tooth to the lesser curvature of the incisor on the same side. Length of Molars (LM): Crown length from M1 to M3. Breadth of Bony palate (BBP): breadth across lateral borders of M1. Length of Bony Palate (LBP): distance from the posterior border of incisive foramen to the posterior border of the palate. Length of Incisive Foramen (LIF): greatest anterior-posterior dimension of one incisive foramen. Breadth of Incisive Foramina (BIF): greatest transverse dimension across both incisive foramina. Breadth of M1 (BM1): greatest crown breadth of the first maxillary molar. Breadth of Zygomatic Plate (BZP): Least distance between the anterior and posterior borders of the zygomatic plate. Length of Zygomatic Arch (LZA): distance length from the anterior border of the zygomatic root to the posterior border of squamosal root.
</p>
         <p>
For statistical analyses, the normality of the data was assessed using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Given that some measurements differed by orders of magnitude, the data were log transformed. In total, 18 variables from 62 individuals were analyzed using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), based on the variance-covariance matrix. The first PC was used to make an 
ANOVA
using Peruvian populations as fixed factors. The Statistical post hoc analysis Tukey-Kramer test for unbalanced groups was performed (α = 0.05). All statistical analyses were performed using R (R 
Core Team 2015
), and Tukey-Kramer test was performed using “DTK” package (
Lau 2013
).

MUSM
35083, 
MUSM
36924, see Appendix I and II) was extracted, and the cytochrome b gene (801 bp) was amplified and sequenced. Methods for 
DNA
extraction and for the amplifications are detailed in 
Smith &amp; Patton (1991
, 
1999
); the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (by ®Roche) and the 
MVZ
0 5 and 
MVZ
16 primers were used (
Smith &amp; Patton 1993
). Amplifications were performed in 50 µL reactions with Platinum® Taq Polymerase (InvitrogenẈ) and recommended concentrations of primers and templates. Reactions were run for 35 cycles at 94°C for 45 s, 45°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 90 s, with initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min and final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Amplified products were sequenced using an external sequencing service (Macrogen, Inc. 
Korea
); the sequences were edited with CodonCode (http:// www.codoncode.com/aligner/). New sequences were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers 
KX258225
– 
KX258228
. In the phylogenetic analyses, we also included 86 sequences of other 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
species, 62 provided by James L. Patton (deposited with accession numbers 
KX792021
– 
KX792082
) and others retrieved from GenBank. Additionally, sequences of 
<tp:taxon-name>Handleyomys alfaroi</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Oligoryzomys flavescens</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Oryzomys palustris, Oreozyzomys</tp:taxon-name>

were retrieved from GenBank and used as outgroup. The full list of accession numbers can be found in Appendix II.
</p>
         <p>
All sequences were aligned in Clustal W (

Thompson 
et al.
1994

) by default parameters, and posteriorly reviewed by eye in order to check for frameshifts, indels or stop codons in 
MEGA
5 (

Tamura 
et al.
2011

); the matrix was completed with ambiguous state characters (i.e., n). Genetic divergence was determined by calculating p-distances (
MEGA
5, 

Tamura 
et al.
2011

). Substitution model GTR+I+gamma was selected with jModelTest (
Posada 2008
), by AIC (using the “propose model” routine). In order to recover phylogenetic relationships, we analyzed the sequence matrix by Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). ML analysis was conducted using the Randomized Accelerated Maximum Likelihood (RAxML) algorithm version 7.0.4 (
Stamatakis 2006
) with 10,000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates to search for the best tree and bootstrap support (BS). BI analysis was performed with MrBayes 3.2.6 (
Ronquist &amp; Huelsenbeck 2003
); four simultaneous Markov chains were run for 20,000,000 generations, with a sampling frequency of 1,000 generations. Convergence on a stable loglikelihood value was verified by plotting the log-likelihood values against generation time for each chain. The first 25% of the trees were discarded as burn-in and the remaining trees were used to compute a 50% majority rule consensus tree and to obtain posterior probability (PP) estimates for each clade.

Eigenvalues and percentages of variation of the first five principal components (PC) are presented in 
Table 3
. PC1 represents 75.8% of the total variation explained by the variable GLS and BBP, PC2 represents 9.7% of the total variation explained by the variable GLS and LM, and PC3 represents 4.0 % of the total variation explained by the variable LR and 
LIB
. The plot of eigenvalues of PC

<tp:taxon-name>N. a. amoenus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
presents an intraspecific variation of 1.2% ± 0.2, and differs from

            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.l.</named-content>
is a monophyletic group and a complex of species. From this, we recognize that 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
is a full species; while 
<tp:taxon-name>N. amoenus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.l.</named-content>
is a complex of taxa, where

            <p>Diagnosis.<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys vargasllosai</tp:taxon-name>
is medium sized rodent distinguished from other congeners by the combination of the following characters: dark brown dorsal fur, dull white with gray basis ventral fur, small metacarpal patch, tapering rostrum, flask-shaped bullae, convex pterygoid plate, presphenoid with concave lateral borders, antero-posteriorly convex and short mesoloph of M1, short and convex posteroloph of M1, deep protoflexus of M2, antero-posteriorly convex mesoloph of M2, straight and short posterolophid of m1, narrow anterolabial cingulum of m2, and straight posterior border of the posterolophid of m2.
</p>
            <p>Morphological description.
Medium size. Dorsal fur is dark brown; soft hairs are dark brown with pale orange tips; fur length is 
10 mm
in average at rump level. Flanks are narrow and yellowish orange. Ventral fur is dull white, with gray roots; ventral fur length is 
4 mm
in average at belly level. Ungual manus tufts pass slightly the claws. Fifth digit of the forefeet passes the second interphalangeal joint of the fourth. Metacarpal patch is small, between II and III finger base, with colored scales and hairs. Carpal vibrissae pass the first interphalangeal joint of the fifth digit. Genal vibrissae do not pass the posterior border of the pinna. Mystacial and superciliary vibrissae pass the posterior border of the pinna. Interramal are inserted on basal protuberances. Hind feet are almost twice forefeet length. Ungual pedal tufts overlap claws. First pedal digit reaches the second digit base, and the fifth digit reaches the second interphalangeal joint of the fourth. Metatarsal patch is absent. Plantar squamation is restricted to the pad region. Tail is around 40 % longer than head-body length. Upper tail hairs are black and they cover 1–2.5 scales; lower hairs are whitish and cover 1.5–3 scales. Pencil present scarce long hairs.

            <p>Skull.
(

) Dorsal view. Rostrum is narrow, laterally flattened. Anterior borders of the nasals are rounded. Posterior borders of the nasals are irregularly square shaped; placed behind both premaxillary-maxillary-frontal and maxillary-frontal-lacrimal joints. Sutures between maxillary and frontal bones are large and numerous. Zygomatic notch is shallow and encloses partially the lacrimal foramen. Lacrimals are rounded; one-half is on the frontal and other in the zygomatic. Interorbital beads are poorly developed. Flanks of interparietal are not projected.
</p>
            <p>Lateral view. Skull profile is slightly convex. Rostrum presents a small hump. Gnathic anterior process is short. The most anterior part of the suture between nasal and premaxillary bones passes the squamosal root of zygomatic. Breadth of the maxillary root of zygomatic is as M3 length. Zygomatic plate breadth is subequal to the upper molar row length. Squamosal zygomatic root breadth is one-half of the zygomatic plate breadth. Ethmoid foramen is placed among the metacone of M1 to mesoloph of M2. Sphenopalatine foramen is placed at metacone of M2 level; its diameter is subequal or slightly greater than M3 length. Ethmoturbinals breadth is as M1 length. Alisphenoid strut is always absent. Tegmen tympani do not overlap the posterior process of the squamosal. Orbicular apophysis of the malleus is globose and elongate; the lamina is rectangle and shallow. Processus brevis of the incus is large, subequal to incus breadth. Internal surface of mastoid tubercle is concave. Upper border of postglenoid foramen is rounded, at subsquamosal foramen level is tapering; both foramina reach the upper border of the mastoid. Hamular process is narrow, as the orbicular apophysis breadth. Mastoid perforation is placed on the posterior border, similar to M3 length, and square shaped.</p>
            <p>Ventral view. Inner borders of the incisive foramina borders are posteriorly convergent. Incisive foramina breadth is about as M1-M2 length. Septum of incisive foramina is narrow. Diastema is flat with a small and elongated hump, placed behind of the premaxillary-maxillary suture. Origin of the superficial masseter is ovoid and slightly protruded; it is placed behind of the anterior border of the zygomatic plate. Maxillary-palatine suture is at hypoflexus level of M1. Posterior palatine foramina are at the hypocone level of M1. Posterolateral palatal pits are placed anterior to the mesopterygoid border level. Sphenopalatine vacuities are open around basisphenoid and presphenoid. Presphenoid is laterally compressed with concave lateral borders. Mesopterygoid fossa breadth is lesser than the incisive foramina breadth. Parapterygoid processes are parallel; laterally, they pass the molar surface level. Borders of the pterygoid plate are convex. Fontanellae are tiny but distinguishable. The posterior opening of the alisphenoid canal breadth is as M3 length. Groove of the infraorbital branch of the stapedial artery is shallow.</p>
            <p>Middle lacerate foramina width is as M3 length. Eustachian tube is short and broad. Bullae are flask-shaped. Anterior bulla process and the pterygoid plate are not in contact. Basioccipital breadth at petrosal level is subequal to breadth between second upper molars. Basioccipital pits are shallow. Anterior border of the foramen magnum is obtuse V-shaped with a moderate notch.</p>
            <p>Jaw.
Masseteric crest is below the procingulum of the m1. Mental foramen is at the labial border of the diastema. Capsular process is moderately developed but does not pass the condylar process. Coronoid process is slightly thin. Condylar process is large and thin. Angular process is short. Crest between condylar and angular process is rounded and shallow. Ventral border of the jaw is concave.
</p>
            <p>Teeth.
Upper. Incisors are opisthodont, with rounded tips and yellow-orange enamel bands. Molar rows are parallel. Procingulum of M1 is anteriorly flattened, narrow and symmetrically divided. Anteroflexus of M1 does not reach the labial surface. Mesoloph of M1 is antero-posteriorly convex and does not reach the labial surface. Posteroloph of M1 does not reach to the labial surface; posterior border is convex. Anteroloph of M2 is broad and reaches the labial surface. Protoflexus of M2 is deep. Mesoloph of M2 is antero-posteriorly convex to the labial surface. Posteroloph of M2 reaches the molar surface. Posterior border of the posteroloph of M2 is rounded. Anteroloph of M3 reaches the paracone surface. Lower. Procingulum of m1 is symmetrically divided. Mesolophid of m1 is narrow. Hypoflexid of m1 is perpendicular to the labial surface. Posterior border of the posterolophid of m1 is straight, and does not reach the lingual surface. Anterolabial cingulum of m2 is narrow. Posterior border of posterolophid of m2 straight and does not reach the lingual surface.

            <p>Natural history.<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys amoenus carceleni</tp:taxon-name>
occurs in the Amazonia from 
Peru
, 
Ecuador
and western 
Brazil
going through Amazon and 
Marañon
Rivers; inhabiting both secondary growth forests and cultivated areas (
Hice &amp; Velazco 2012
). Regarding reproduction, captured females were pregnant during dry season (between June and September) as in rainy season (between February and March), and lactating between November and December (
Hice &amp; Velazco 2012
); whereas males were recorded with scrotal testes in June, August, September, November, and December (

Metacarpal patch is small, between II and III finger base, with colored scales and hairs. Carpal vibrissae pass the first interphalangeal joint of the fifth digit. Genal vibrissae do not pass the posterior border of the pinna. Mystacial and superciliary vibrissae pass the posterior border of the pinna. Interramal are inserted on basal protuberances. Hind feet are almost twice forefeet length. Ungual pedal tufts overlap claws. First pedal digit reaches the second digit base, and the fifth digit reaches the second interphalangeal joint of the fourth. Metatarsal patch is absent. Plantar squamation is restricted to the pad region. Tail is around 40 % longer than head-body length. Upper tail hairs are black and they cover 1–2.5 scales; lower hairs are whitish and cover 1.5–3 scales. Pencil present scarce long hairs.

The most anterior part of the suture between nasal and premaxillary bones passes the squamosal root of zygomatic. Breadth of the maxillary root of zygomatic is as M3 length. Zygomatic plate breadth is subequal to the upper molar row length. Squamosal zygomatic root breadth is one-half of the zygomatic plate breadth. Ethmoid foramen is placed among the metacone of M1 to mesoloph of M2. Sphenopalatine foramen is placed at metacone of M2 level; its diameter is subequal or slightly greater than M3 length. Ethmoturbinals breadth is as M1 length. Alisphenoid strut is always absent. Tegmen tympani do not overlap the posterior process of the squamosal. Orbicular apophysis of the malleus is globose and elongate; the lamina is rectangle and shallow. Processus brevis of the incus is large, subequal to incus breadth. Internal surface of mastoid tubercle is concave. Upper border of postglenoid foramen is rounded, at subsquamosal foramen level is tapering; both foramina reach the upper border of the mastoid. Hamular process is narrow, as the orbicular apophysis breadth. Mastoid perforation is placed on the posterior border, similar to M3 length, and square shaped.</p>
            <p>Ventral view. Inner borders of the incisive foramina borders are posteriorly convergent. Incisive foramina breadth is about as M1-M2 length. Septum of incisive foramina is narrow.

            <p>Morphological description.
Medium size. Dorsal fur is reddish brown; soft hairs are dark brown with reddish-orange tips and spines are white with black tips; dorsal hair length is 
9 mm
in average at the rump level; flanks are reddish. Ventral fur is white with gray on the basal half; ventral fur length is 
4 mm
in average at belly level. Hairs of ungual manus tufts pass claws slightly. Fifth forefeet digit passes the second interphalangeal joint of the fourth digit. Metacarpal patch is large, between second and fourth digit, with dark scales and hairs. Carpal vibrissae are short reaching the base of the fifth digit. Genal vibrissae pass the posterior border of the pinna. Superciliary vibrissae do not pass the posterior border of the pinna. Interramal vibrissae are inserted in a basal protuberance. Hind feet are thick and large, almost twice forefeet length. Ungual pedal tufts do not pass claws. First pedal digit reaches second digit base; the fifth digit reaches the second interphalangeal joint of the fourth digit. Metatarsal patch is present. Plantar squamation is restricted to pad region. Tail is approximately 20 % longer than head-body length. Upper hairs of the tail are black, covering 1.5–2 scales; lower hairs are whitish, covering 2 scales. Terminal pencil presents scarce long hairs.

            <p>Skull
. (

) Dorsal view. Rostrum is broad and tapering. Anterior borders of the nasals are rounded. Posterior borders of the nasals are irregularly rounded, behind premaxillary-maxillary-frontal joint and maxillaryfrontal-lacrimal joints. Sutures between premaxillary and frontal bones are short and separate. Zygomatic notch is shallow; not enclosing the lacrimal foramen. Lacrimals are rounded; two-third dips in frontal bone, one-third dips in zygomatic bone. Interorbital beads are moderately developed.
</p>
            <p>Lateral view. Skull profile is flattened. Rostrum is anteriorly flat. Gnathic process is small. The most anterior part of the suture between nasal and premaxillary bones does not reach the squamosal zygomatic root. Breadth of the maxillary root of zygomatic is one-third upper row molar length. Breadth of the zygomatic plate and the squamosal root of zygomatic are subequal. Ethmoid and sphenopalatine foramina are placed at the anterior border of the M2. Ethmoturbinals are square shaped and its diameter is about one-half of M3. Alisphenoid strut is always present. Tegmen tympani do not overlap the posterior process of the squamosal. Orbicular apophysis of the malleus bone is large and globose; manubrium is large, and the lamina is rectangle and deep. Processus brevis of the incus is smaller than the incus breadth. Postglenoid foramina are continuous with the middle lacerate foramina. Mastoid tubercle is interiorly concave. Dorsal margins of postglenoid foramina and subsquamosal fenestra are rounded and reach the upper border of the mastoid. Hamular process is thick. Mastoid perforation is always present, with variable position, size, and shape.</p>
            <p>Ventral view. Inner borders of the incisive foramina are posteriorly parallel. Incisive foramina breadth is about the length of M2-M3. Septum is narrow. Diastema is flat. Origin of the superficial masseter is circular and flat, placed at the anterior border of the zygomatic plate. Maxillary-palatine suture is placed among hypocone and hypoflexus of M1. Posterior palatine foramina are at the protoflexus level of M2. Posterolateral palatal pits are large and ovoid shaped, ranging from hypocone of M3 to the anterior mesopterygoid border. Sphenopalatine vacuities are large, occupying the basisphenoid and presphenoid area, with irregular borders. Presphenoid is triangle shaped, and broad with straight borders.

            <p>Diagnosis.<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys vargasllosai</tp:taxon-name>
is medium sized rodent distinguished from other congeners by the combination of the following characters: dark brown dorsal fur, dull white with gray basis ventral fur, small metacarpal patch, tapering rostrum, flask-shaped bullae, convex pterygoid plate, presphenoid with concave lateral borders, antero-posteriorly convex and short mesoloph of M1, short and convex posteroloph of M1, deep protoflexus of M2, antero-posteriorly convex mesoloph of M2, straight and short posterolophid of m1, narrow anterolabial cingulum of m2, and straight posterior border of the posterolophid of m2.
</p>
            <p>Morphological description.
Medium size. Dorsal fur is dark brown; soft hairs are dark brown with pale orange tips; fur length is 
10 mm
in average at rump level. Flanks are narrow and yellowish orange. Ventral fur is dull white, with gray roots; ventral fur length is 
4 mm
in average at belly level. Ungual manus tufts pass slightly the claws. Fifth digit of the forefeet passes the second interphalangeal joint of the fourth. Metacarpal patch is small, between II and III finger base, with colored scales and hairs. Carpal vibrissae pass the first interphalangeal joint of the fifth digit. Genal vibrissae do not pass the posterior border of the pinna. Mystacial and superciliary vibrissae pass the posterior border of the pinna. Interramal are inserted on basal protuberances. Hind feet are almost twice forefeet length. Ungual pedal tufts overlap claws. First pedal digit reaches the second digit base, and the fifth digit reaches the second interphalangeal joint of the fourth. Metatarsal patch is absent. Plantar squamation is restricted to the pad region. Tail is around 40 % longer than head-body length. Upper tail hairs are black and they cover 1–2.5 scales; lower hairs are whitish and cover 1.5–3 scales. Pencil present scarce long hairs.

Undoubtedly the diversity of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
is still far from being completely known. Although we have confirmed that 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.l.</named-content>
is a complex of species, which some of them presented available names in the synonym of the genus (
<tp:taxon-name>N. amoenus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.l.</named-content>
) and one of them has been described in this study as a new species (
<tp:taxon-name>N. vargasllosai</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
); based on the phylogenetic reconstruction and the genetic distances (

) we conclude that there still are candidate species pending of taxonomic revision and naming (e.g. 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
sp. “clade 3”, 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
sp. “clade 6”, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
sp. “clade 7”). The results presented here, including detailed morphological descriptions and phylogenetic support, will contribute to resolving the taxonomy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
.

         <p>
The morphological and molecular differentiation between 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>N. amoenus amoenus</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>N. a. carceleni</tp:taxon-name>
recorded here allows for the delimitation of these taxa, as well as for the distinction of 
<tp:taxon-name>N. vargasllosai</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
from those taxa (
Table 1
, 

-4, Systematics section). Morphological qualitative analysis showed that these rodents can be easily distinguished from each other, that is important to encourage revisions of those 
<tp:taxon-name>Oryzomyini</tp:taxon-name>
taxa which are spuriously known as cosmopolitan or wide ranged species, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>Oecomys bicolor
(Tomes, 1860)
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Nectomys rattus
Pelzeln, 1883
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>Oligoryzomys microtis

</tp:taxon-name>
(
Carleton &amp; Musser 2015
; Bonvicino &amp; Weksler 2015; 
Weksler &amp; Bonvicino 2015b
, respectively). Regarding the molecular analysis, surprisingly we found that any of the sequences previously labeled as “ 
<tp:taxon-name>spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
” were actually 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
The haplotype here recorded of 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
(from the vicinities of the 
type
locality) is the first and unique sequence published (
MUSM

KX258228
), specimen that is morphometric and morphological supported as “ 
<tp:taxon-name>spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
” (see Fig. 4, Appendix I and II), thus we provide a plate supplementary plate of this specimen (Fig. S1); additionally we corroborated that this specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
differs morphologically from two specimens recorded at northern 
Amazonas
department

(locality 
27 in
the map, see appendix II for details), which are haplotypes allocated to 
<tp:taxon-name>N. amoenus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.l.</named-content>
and morphologically recognized as 
<tp:taxon-name>N. a. carceleni</tp:taxon-name>
(
EU579504
and 
KX792049
). Thus, we suggest including this taxonomic update in such studies that invoked “ 
<tp:taxon-name>spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
”, both in their results and discussions based on molecular evidence of cytochrome b gene (e.g. 

Patton

<tp:taxon-name>N. amoenus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.l.</named-content>

            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.l.</named-content>
might be assessed in phylogeographic and morphological frame in the future, in order to clarify whether the four clades are full species or there is geographical structure among clades.

The “ 
<tp:taxon-name>tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
” group is a polytomy formed by five species and three candidate species. 
<tp:taxon-name>N. tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
is close related to Amazonian species, as was proposed by 

Patton 
et al.
(2000)

; this species is represented by a single haplotype of 177 bp (see 

Patton 
et al.
2000

for sequencing details), even when this sequence is different enough, we suggest to add larger haplotypes in order to improve the phylogenetic relationships within the group. The Guianese species 
<tp:taxon-name>N. guianae</tp:taxon-name>
is sister group of the candidate species 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
sp. “clade 6”, which is distributed in the Amazon State of 
Brazil
(

Patton

Catzeflis &amp; Tilak 2009
); this species has been differentiated molecularly before (

Patton

; 
Catzeflis &amp; Tilak 2009
), but is still pending of morphological revision and naming. The other Guianese species 
<tp:taxon-name>N. dubosti</tp:taxon-name>
is sister group of the candidate species 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
sp. “clade 7”, distributed in the 
Pará
State of 
Brazil
(

Patton

<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
sp. “clade 3”, occurs in the Amazonia of 
Ecuador
and northern 
Peru
; it presents three groups of haplotypes, one from the Ecuadorian population, other from Peruvian population, and only one haplotype from the pre-Andean population (
MVZ
153530). 
<tp:taxon-name>N. musseri</tp:taxon-name>
presents three groups of haplotypes that match with the geographic distribution in the Amazon Basin (haplotypes from 
Loreto
), Juruá Basin (haplotypes from 
Acre
and 
Madre de Dios
), and mountain cloud forests (haplotypes from 
Cusco
). 
<tp:taxon-name>N. minutus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.l.</named-content>
is formed by two clades that match with their distribution along the Juruá River “upriver clade” and “downriver clade” (

Patton 
et al.
2000

). These clades present enough morphometric (multivariate) and molecular (6.9% of genetic divergence) evidence to be considered different species, but need further taxonomic revision (

Patton 
et al.
2000

). The genetic clustering within 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
sp. “clade 3”, 
<tp:taxon-name>N. musseri</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>N. minutus</tp:taxon-name>
might be assessed in a phylogeographic framework.

         <p>Biogeography</p>
         <p>
The biogeographic ranges of the species within “ 
<tp:taxon-name>spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
” group are distinct. 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
is an endemic species from 
Peru
that inhabits in mountain cloud forests between the southern of 
Marañon
River to the northern of Huallaga River (
Lawrence 1941; this study
). 
<tp:taxon-name>N. vargasllosai</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
inhabits in mountain cloud forests between 
Peru
and 
Bolivia
from the northern of the Inambari River to western 
Santa Cruz
(
Thomas 1901
; 

Pacheco 
et al.
2011

; this study). Likewise, 
<tp:taxon-name>N. amoenus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.l</named-content>
occurs in the Cerrado between eastern 
Bolivia
and western 
Brazil
, and the Amazon rainforests from southeastern 
Ecuador
to northeastern 
Peru
. Contrasting with the last record of Peruvian mammals (

Pacheco 
et al.
2009

), we conclude that at least five species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
are present in 
Peru
(
<tp:taxon-name>N. amoenus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>N. minutus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>N. musseri</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>N. spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>N. vargasllosai</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
).
</p>
         <p>
Based on the species’ distributions in the Andes, it is possible that rivers on the eastern slope of the Andes (e.g. 
Marañón
, Huallaga, 
Apurimac
, and Inambari) could have played a role in delimiting the distribution of these species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
. The role of rivers in the diversification of Andean biota has been previously proposed in birds (e.g. 

Ribas 
et al.
2007

; 
Weir 2009
; 
Bonaccorso 2009
; 

Chaves 
et al.

, 
Winger &amp; Bates 2015
), plants (e.g.

) and rodents (
Patton &amp; Smith 1992
). In the case of sigmodontine rodents, 
Patton &amp; Smith (1992)
were the precursors assessing the allopatric role of Andean rivers in the diversification of 
<tp:taxon-name>Akodon</tp:taxon-name>
; they recovered reciprocal monophyly between populations without morphological support, suggesting that further taxonomic analysis is needed to support speciation. After the research of 
Patton &amp; Smith (1992)
, recent taxonomic studies invoked the allopatric role of the rivers along the Andes to constrain the distribution of sigmodontine species (e.g. 
Luna &amp; Pacheco, 2002
; 

Jiménez 
et al.
2013

; 

Pacheco 
et al.
2014

; 
Rengifo &amp; Pacheco 2015
), however some of these studies have failed to use formal methods to assess allopatric speciation or lacks phylogenetic support. In this context, the divergence of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
species in the Andes could be due to the allopatric role of the Andean rivers; however, further analysis is needed to assess whether these rivers were preexisting barriers or not.
</p>
         <p>
The origin and diversification of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
as other 
<tp:taxon-name>Oryzomyini</tp:taxon-name>
has been proposed in the lowlands of South America; for instance, 
Weksler (2006)
suggested that 
<tp:taxon-name>Euryoryzomys</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Mindomys</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Oreoryzomys</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Scolomys</tp:taxon-name>
might have originated in western Amazonia and/or in the eastern Andes, based on the phylogenetic relationships and species distributions. 
Leiteet al.
(2014) estimated the ancestral area distribution for the most recent common ancestor (
MRCA
) among sigmodontine, concluding that the 
MRCA
of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
inhabited eastern South America and the northern Andes. Given that the central Andes was dismissed from 
Leiteet al
.’s analysis of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
, we suggest that the distribution of the 
MRCA
of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
needs to be reanalyzed. Recently, 

Parada 
et al.
(2013

, 
2015
) assessed the diversification of sigmodontines using exhaustive taxonomic sampling, and among other remarkable results, they found that the hypothetical ancestor of 
<tp:taxon-name>Oryzomyini</tp:taxon-name>
as well as of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
, could have originated and diversified in the lowlands of South America (e.g. Cerrado, Pampas or Amazonia). Herein, based on the topology of the tree (

) we suggest that 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
could have originated in the lowlands of northwestern South America, where two lineages diverged. One lineage stayed in the 
Guiana
shield (“ 
<tp:taxon-name>paracou</tp:taxon-name>
” group); while the second one diversified and then invaded the remaining areas in western and southern South America forming two additional lineages (“ 
<tp:taxon-name>tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
” and “ 
<tp:taxon-name>spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
” groups). The lineage of “ 
<tp:taxon-name>spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
” group would have diversified in the Central Andes and expanded toward the northern Andes, the Cerrado and western Amazonia (
<tp:taxon-name>N. amoenus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.l.</named-content>
), while the lineage of “ 
<tp:taxon-name>tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
” group would have diversified in western Amazonia and Northern Andes, and then expanded toward the Central Andes (
<tp:taxon-name>N. musseri</tp:taxon-name>
) and 
Guiana
shield (
<tp:taxon-name>N. guianae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>N. dubosti</tp:taxon-name>
). This biogeographic approach suggests that the Andes were invaded by two different lineages of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
(“ 
<tp:taxon-name>tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
” and “ 
<tp:taxon-name>spinosus</tp:taxon-name>
” groups), while the 
Guiana
shield was posteriorly invaded by two lineages of the “ 
<tp:taxon-name>tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
” group. It is noted that this hypothesis must be properly tested with the inclusion of 
<tp:taxon-name>N. pictus</tp:taxon-name>
, which could give evidence regarding the historical scenario of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neacomys</tp:taxon-name>
in Central America.
