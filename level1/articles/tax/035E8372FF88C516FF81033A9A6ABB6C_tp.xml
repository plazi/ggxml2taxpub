At present, only a handful of harpacticoid species of the families 
<tp:taxon-name>Ameiridae Boeck</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Ancorabolidae Sars</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Argestidae Por</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Rhizothrichidae Por</tp:taxon-name>
have been described from the deep sea of the 
Gulf
of 
California
and west coast of the 
Baja California
Peninsula. Recent efforts resulted in the description of a new genus, 
WellstenvaliaGómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza, 2021
, closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>MuohuysiaÖzdikmen, 2009</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>WellstenheliaKaranovic &amp; Kim, 2014</tp:taxon-name>
and some new deep-sea species of 
<tp:taxon-name>DelavaliaBrady, 1869</tp:taxon-name>
. Other new stenheliin genera from the 
Gulf
of 
California
and the west coast of the 
Baja California
Peninsula are the subjects of another contribution in this volume. The present contribution deals with the description of the first deep-sea representatives of 
<tp:taxon-name>PseudostenheliaWells, 1967</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>BeatricellaScott, 1905</tp:taxon-name>
, two typically shallow brackish water and marine genera. Some comments on their relationships are given.

The subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenheliinae Brady</tp:taxon-name>
currently accommodates 14 genera: 
<tp:taxon-name>AnisostenheliaMu &amp; Huys, 2002</tp:taxon-name>
(monotypic), 
<tp:taxon-name>BeatricellaScott, 1905</tp:taxon-name>
(monotypic), 
<tp:taxon-name>CladorostrataTai &amp; Song, 1979</tp:taxon-name>
(two species), 
<tp:taxon-name>DelavaliaBrady, 1869</tp:taxon-name>
(50 species), 
<tp:taxon-name>ItostenheliaKaranovic &amp; Kim, 2014</tp:taxon-name>
(two species), 
<tp:taxon-name>LonchoeidestenheliaGómez, 2020</tp:taxon-name>
(monotypic), 
<tp:taxon-name>MelimaPor, 1964</tp:taxon-name>
(five species), 
<tp:taxon-name>MuohuysiaÖzdikmen, 2009</tp:taxon-name>
(monotypic), 
<tp:taxon-name>OnychostenheliaItô, 1979</tp:taxon-name>
(two species), 
<tp:taxon-name>PseudostenheliaWells, 1967</tp:taxon-name>
(three species), 
<tp:taxon-name>StenheliaBoeck, 1865</tp:taxon-name>
(eight species), 
<tp:taxon-name>WellstenheliaKaranovic &amp; Kim, 2014</tp:taxon-name>
(nine species), 
Wellstenvalia
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza (monotypic), and 
<tp:taxon-name>WillenstenheliaKaranovic &amp; Kim, 2014</tp:taxon-name>
(six species) (
Gómez 2021
; 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
; 
Karanovic &amp; Kim 2014
; 
Wells 2007
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenheliinae</tp:taxon-name>
is a predominantly shallow-water taxon and only a few representatives (
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenvalia wellsiGómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza, 2021</tp:taxon-name>
, and some species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
) are known from the deep sea (&gt; 
200 m
depth) (see 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
, 
Gómez 2021
).
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
is primarily a marine and brackish shallow-water genus with three species, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. primaWells, 1967</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. secundaWells, 1971</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. wellsiCoull &amp; Fleeger, 1977</tp:taxon-name>
and the so far monotypic 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
seems to be restricted to shallow marine habitats. Preliminary analyses of deep-sea sediment samples taken in the central and southern regions of the 
Gulf
of 
California
, and in the west coast of the 
Baja California
Peninsula during four oceanographic cruises on board research vessel “El Puma” (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de 
México
) (

) revealed a high species richness and diversity of benthic harpacticoids of which the subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenheliinae</tp:taxon-name>
is an important component. Previous studies (
e.g.Mu &amp; Huys 2002
; 
Willen 2003
) discussed on the shallow origin of some deep-sea stenheliins, 

viz. 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
, which seems to be confirmed in the present study. Here I describe the first species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
from the deep-sea of the 
Gulf
of 
California
and west coast of the 
Baja California
Peninsula. This is the eighth contribution on deep-sea harpacticoids and the second of a series of papers on deep-sea stenheliins from the 
Gulf
of 
California
and adjacent waters dedicated to Prof. J. B. J. Wells.

            <p>
Second and third urosomites completely fused forming genital double-somite, without any trace of division, slightly longer than wide, widest part measured in the middle, no surface sensilla nor spinular ornamentation detected, posterior hyaline fringe smooth (

).
</p>
            <p>
Fourth and fifth urosomites seemingly without surface sensilla dorsally (

) nor ventrally (

), dorsally without (

), ventrally with medial row of spinules (

).
</p>
            <p>
Anal somite 1.7 times as wide as long (

), with lateroventral spinules close to joint of caudal rami, seemingly without sensilla, with two lateral and two ventral pores (

); anal operculum inconspicuous.
</p>
            <p>
Caudal rami elongate, about five times as long as wide (

) and about two times as long as anal somite, slightly divergent, each ramus with one subdistal pore ventrally, with dorsal spinules close to seta II, and on inner margin subdistally, with seven elements (

); seta I and II arising subdistally, the former ventral to and half the length of the latter; seta III subdistal, arising ventrally (

; lost in 

); seta IV and V arising distally, both with fracture plane and rat-like, the former shorter; seta VI issuing at inner distal corner; dorsal seta VII triarticulate at base, situated subdistally close to inner margin.
</p>
            <p>
Rostrum (

) trapezoidal, not fused to cephalothorax, slightly bifid, subdistal sensilla lost during dissection.
</p>
            <p>
Antennule (

) six-segmented, all segments smooth except for spinular row on first segment; all setae smooth; second segment with two, third segment with one seta with fracture plane; sixth segment with two articulated setae. Armature formula: 1(1); 2(9); 3(7); 4(4 + (1 + ae)), 5(2); 6(11 + acro). Acrothek consisting of two setae and one slender aesthetasc fused basally.
</p>
            <p>
Antenna (

). Coxa short, with some slender outer spinules. Allobasis as long as free endopodal segment, with inner spinules proximally, with one slender abexopodal seta arising midway inner margin. Exopod threesegmented; first and third segments longest, each about three times as long as wide, and with spinules as shown; first and second segment with one pinnate seta each, third segment with one pinnate proximal and three smooth apical setae. Endopod with strong inner spinules, laterally with two spines and one slender seta, distally with six elements (outermost pinnate seta fused basally to strongly spinulose adjacent element), outer margin with two subdistal frills.
</p>
            <p>
Mandible (

) with relatively short coxa. Gnathobase wide, ventral distal corner produced into small sharp semi-hyaline process, with several acute teeth distally, and two smooth setae ventrally. Basis elongate, with narrow base, widest medially, with spinules as shown, with three subdistal setae. Exopod elongate, about four times as long as wide, tapering distally, with three lateral and three distal setae. Endopod recurved, twisted over exopod, with two lateral and six distal elements (two pairs of which fused basally).
</p>
            <p>
Maxillule (

). Praecoxa and arthrite lost during dissection. Coxa with one pinnate and one smooth seta. Basis with small inner spinules, and with seven elements of which two pinnate. Exopod and endopod onesegmented, confluent, not fused to supporting basis; endopod larger than exopod, the former with four, the latter with two setae.
</p>
            <p>
Maxilla (

). Large syncoxa seemingly without spinular ornamentation, with three endites; proximal endite smallest, with one seta; middle endite with one smooth and one spinulose seta; distal endite with one smooth and two spinulose elements. Basis drawn out into strong spinulose claw, additionally with strong naked spine and two slender setae. Endopod about 1.5 times as long as wide, with five slender setae (one arising basally, two medially, and two apically).
</p>
            <p>
Maxilliped (

) subchelate. Syncoxa elongate, rectangular; about 2.5 times as long as wide, with inner spinules subdistally, with two pinnate setae issuing subdistally at the same level, and one distal pinnate element arising from pedestal. Basis slightly shorter than syncoxa, oval, with arched row of outer spinules, with one anterior and one posterior inner spinular row as depicted, with two slender subdistal setae, one of which visibly longer. Endopod one-segmented, with one claw-like spinulose element and one smooth seta.
</p>
            <p>

            <p>Remarks and discussion.
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
accommodates three species, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. prima</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. secunda</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. wellsi</tp:taxon-name>
. Members of the genus have a preference for shallow brackish conditions with detritus-rich fine sediments (mud and fine sand). The discovery of the female of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. secunda</tp:taxon-name>
in plankton samples from Lake Kolleru (
India
) (
Ranga Reddy 1984
) is, to the best of my knowledge, the only report of a species of this genus from freshwater habitats. 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia prima</tp:taxon-name>
, the first species assigned to this genus, was found in fine sediments (mud or muddy sand) from Saco da Inhaca, a shallow inlet south of Inhaca Island (
Mozambique
) (
Wells 1967
). The male of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. secunda</tp:taxon-name>
, the second species included in this genus, was found in muddy sediments from the estuary of the Vellar river near Parangipettai (formerly Porto Novo) in the 
Tamil Nadu State
(
India
) (
McIntyre 1968
; 
Wells 1971
), and the female was found in a freshwater lake (see above; 
Ranga Reddy 1984
). Finally, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. wellsi</tp:taxon-name>
was found in muddy intertidal sediments from 
South Carolina
(
USA
) (
Coull &amp; Fleeger 1977
).

The relationships between 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and some other stenheliins are not clear. 

Dahms 
et al.
(2005)

proposed some apomorphies for 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
(

Dahms 
et al.
2005: 12

, table 2) based on naupliar morphology. They also gave a list of characters shared by 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
viz.
the extremely foreshortened cephalic shield, the presence of a spinous process on the distal third (middle?; 
Huys &amp; Mu 2008
) of the second antennulary segment and a notched inner seta on the third antennulary segment, and a lobate outer protuberance of the first segment of the exopod of the antenna. 
Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
questioned the phylogenetic significance of these characters, but admitted that they appear to be unique within 
<tp:taxon-name>Harpacticoida</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
drew attention to a core group of 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenheliinae</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cladorostrata</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
) sharing a synapomorphic confluent maxillulary exopod and endopod not fused to the supporting basis. This condition is present also in 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
(
Karanovic &amp; Kim 2014
; 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
) and 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia
(
Gómez, 2020
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and is confirmed here for 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
. Note that 
Ranga Reddy (1984)
described the maxillulary rami as discrete and separated from basis, but this is most probably erroneous. The significance of this condition in the maxillulary rami is not clear but 
Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
suggested that the confluent maxillulary rami separated from the basis could be a strong synapomorphy for 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cladorostrata</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
, but also for 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
. However, its presence in some other stenheliin lineages (

e.g. 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
) seems to indicate convergent evolution (see also 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
).
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
shares a plesiomorphic anal operculum (semicircular, relatively small, weakly chitinized and flanked by a sensilla on each side) with 
<tp:taxon-name>Melima</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia
(
Willen 2003
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, but also with 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
(see also 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
), and it is completely absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia
(
Mu &amp; Huys 2002
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia
(
Huys &amp; Mu 2008
)
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Although its significance is not clear, the caudal seta I is either a spine-like element or a reduced seta in most stenheliins, but it is a well-developed seta (most probably plesiomorphic) in 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, and some species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia
(
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
)
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
In addition to the synapomorphic nature of the structure of the maxillulary rami in 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cladorostrata</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
(see above), 
Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
suggested that the resemblance in leg segmentation and armature between 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
observed by 
Itô (1979)
had little phylogenetic significance. However, as noted above (see also Gómez &amp; Barraza 2020), the phylogenetic importance of the confluent maxillulary rami separated from the supporting basis, the shape of caudal seta I, and anal operculum is questionable. On the other hand, the shape of P1 EXP (EXP3 smaller than EXP2 and EXP3), giving the entire ramus a characteristic appearance (except for the somewhat longer P1 EXP 
3 in<tp:taxon-name>P. bathyalis</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
)

, the exceedingly long outer elements of P1 EXP2 and EXP3, and the two-segmented endopod of P2–P4, seem to be strong synapomorphies for these two genera.
</p>
            <p>
Both sexes are known for all 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia
species

               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
The female of the new deep-sea species can be readily separated from the females of its congeners by the segmentation of the antennule (with six segments in the new species, but with five segments in other species), and by its armature complement of P2 ENP2 and P3 ENP2, with five and seven setae instead of four and five setae respectively. The minute proximal endite of the maxillary syncoxa with one seta only, and the reduction of the armature complement on the P5 EXP from six to five setae seem to be the only potential apomorphies for the species.

            <p>Remarks and discussion.
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
was reinstated by 
Mu &amp; Huys (2002)
to reallocate 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia aemulaScott, 1893</tp:taxon-name>
and one 
species inquirenda
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia aemula sensuMarinov (1977)</tp:taxon-name>
. According to 
Mu &amp; Huys (2002: 203)
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
does not display any of the seven synapomorphies for 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, but can be defined upon three apomorphies: 1) male P2 ENP2 drawn out into sigmoid finely pinnate process and outer margin with row of long spinules, 2) P4 ENP1 with very long stout seta, and 3) the male P5 EXP incorporated in baseoendopod and outermost seta modified into strong spine. According to 
Mu &amp; Huys (2002)
, the sigmoid process on the male P2 ENP2 of 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
is an apomorphy for the genus. However, the apomorphic status of the long stout inner seta on P4 ENP1 and the fused male P5 EXP and BENP with outermost element modified into a strong spine is uncertain as it is shared by some other stenheliins (see 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
).
</p>
            <p>
The new species proposed here was attributed to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
by the combination of its three-segmented P1 ENP, primitive armature formula of P2 EXP3 (with two inner setae; armature formula 223) and P3 EXP3 (with three inner setae; armature formula 323), and presence of normal setae only on the endopodal lobe of P5. 
Mu &amp; Huys (2002)
suggested that the lack of an inner seta on P1 EXP2 could be a potential synapomorphy for 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
,

but also 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
. However, the presence of an inner seta on P1 EXP 
2 in<tp:taxon-name>B. calidafornax</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
seems to confirm that the lack of an inner seta on P1 EXP 
2 in<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
is likely the result of a secondary loss and cannot be regarded as synapomorphic for 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
,

and 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
- 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
. On the other hand, 
<tp:taxon-name>B. calidafornax</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>Itostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Willenstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
Wellstenvalia
in the retention of one inner seta on P1 EXP2. It is similar also to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. asetosa</tp:taxon-name>
in the loss of the inner seta on P2 EXP1. Interestingly, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. asetosa</tp:taxon-name>
shares the armature formula of P2 EXP (0,1,123) with 
<tp:taxon-name>Willenstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The description of the new species proposed herein confirms that the caudal seta I of 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
is spine-like and this condition is shared, at least, with 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cladorostrata</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Itostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, most species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
Me. papuaensis
, and some species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
(see 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
).

The male of 
<tp:taxon-name>B. calidafornax</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
remains unknown, but this species can be readily separated from 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
by the relative length of caudal rami (as long as anal somite in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
, but as long as three last urosomites combined in the new species), number of segments of the female antennule (eight segments in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
, but seven segments in the new species), armature complement of P1 EXP2 (without inner seta in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
, but with inner seta in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. calidafornax</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
), P2 EXP1 (with inner seta in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
, but without inner armature in the new species), and relative length of outermost seta on female P5 endopodal lobe (very small in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
, but well developed in the Mexican species).

<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia prima</tp:taxon-name>
, the first species assigned to this genus, was found in fine sediments (mud or muddy sand) from Saco da Inhaca, a shallow inlet south of Inhaca Island (
Mozambique
) (
Wells 1967
). The male of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. secunda</tp:taxon-name>

Tamil Nadu State
(
India
) (
McIntyre 1968

Wells 1971
), and the female was found in a freshwater lake (see above; 
Ranga Reddy 1984

viz.
the extremely foreshortened cephalic shield, the presence of a spinous process on the distal third (middle?; 
Huys &amp; Mu 2008
) of the second antennulary segment and a notched inner seta on the third antennulary segment, and a lobate outer protuberance of the first segment of the exopod of the antenna. 
Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
questioned the phylogenetic significance of these characters, but admitted that they appear to be unique within 
<tp:taxon-name>Harpacticoida</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
drew attention to a core group of 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenheliinae</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cladorostrata</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
) sharing a synapomorphic confluent maxillulary exopod and endopod not fused to the supporting basis. This condition is present also in 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
(
Karanovic &amp; Kim 2014
; 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
) and 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia
(
Gómez, 2020
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and is confirmed here for 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
. Note that 
Ranga Reddy (1984)
described the maxillulary rami as discrete and separated from basis, but this is most probably erroneous. The significance of this condition in the maxillulary rami is not clear but 
Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
suggested that the confluent maxillulary rami separated from the basis could be a strong synapomorphy for 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cladorostrata</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
, but also for 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
. However, its presence in some other stenheliin lineages (

e.g. 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
) seems to indicate convergent evolution (see also 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
).

            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>Melima</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia
(
Willen 2003
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, but also with 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
(see also 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021

<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia
(

</tp:taxon-name>

(
Huys &amp; Mu 2008
)
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Although its significance is not clear, the caudal seta I is either a spine-like element or a reduced seta in most stenheliins, but it is a well-developed seta (most probably plesiomorphic) in 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, and some species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia
(

)
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
In addition to the synapomorphic nature of the structure of the maxillulary rami in 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cladorostrata</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
(see above), 
Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
suggested that the resemblance in leg segmentation and armature between 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
observed by 
Itô (1979)
had little phylogenetic significance. However, as noted above (see also Gómez &amp; Barraza 2020), the phylogenetic importance of the confluent maxillulary rami separated from the supporting basis, the shape of caudal seta I, and anal operculum is questionable. On the other hand, the shape of P1 EXP (EXP3 smaller than EXP2 and EXP3), giving the entire ramus a characteristic appearance (except for the somewhat longer P1 EXP 
3 in<tp:taxon-name>P. bathyalis</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
)

, the exceedingly long outer elements of P1 EXP2 and EXP3, and the two-segmented endopod of P2–P4, seem to be strong synapomorphies for these two genera.
</p>
            <p>
Both sexes are known for all 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia

               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
The female of the new deep-sea species can be readily separated from the females of its congeners by the segmentation of the antennule (with six segments in the new species, but with five segments in other species), and by its armature complement of P2 ENP2 and P3 ENP2, with five and seven setae instead of four and five setae respectively. The minute proximal endite of the maxillary syncoxa with one seta only, and the reduction of the armature complement on the P5 EXP from six to five setae seem to be the only potential apomorphies for the species.

The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>

and one 
species inquirenda
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia aemula sensuMarinov (1977)</tp:taxon-name>

Mu &amp; Huys (2002: 203)
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
does not display any of the seven synapomorphies for 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, but can be defined upon three apomorphies: 1) male P2 ENP2 drawn out into sigmoid finely pinnate process and outer margin with row of long spinules, 2) P4 ENP1 with very long stout seta, and 3) the male P5 EXP incorporated in baseoendopod and outermost seta modified into strong spine. According to 
Mu &amp; Huys (2002)
, the sigmoid process on the male P2 ENP2 of 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
is an apomorphy for the genus. However, the apomorphic status of the long stout inner seta on P4 ENP1 and the fused male P5 EXP and BENP with outermost element modified into a strong spine is uncertain as it is shared by some other stenheliins (see 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
).
</p>
            <p>
The new species proposed here was attributed to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
by the combination of its three-segmented P1 ENP, primitive armature formula of P2 EXP3 (with two inner setae; armature formula 223) and P3 EXP3 (with three inner setae; armature formula 323), and presence of normal setae only on the endopodal lobe of P5. 
Mu &amp; Huys (2002)
suggested that the lack of an inner seta on P1 EXP2 could be a potential synapomorphy for 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>

but also

               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
seems to confirm that the lack of an inner seta on P1 EXP

<tp:taxon-name>Willenstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
Wellstenvalia
in the retention of one inner seta on P1 EXP2. It is similar also to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. asetosa</tp:taxon-name>
in the loss of the inner seta on P2 EXP1. Interestingly, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. asetosa</tp:taxon-name>
shares the armature formula of P2 EXP (0,1,123) with 
<tp:taxon-name>Willenstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The description of the new species proposed herein confirms that the caudal seta I of 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
is spine-like and this condition is shared, at least, with 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cladorostrata</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Itostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, most species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
Me. papuaensis
, and some species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
(see 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
).

The male of 
<tp:taxon-name>B. calidafornax</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
remains unknown, but this species can be readily separated from 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
by the relative length of caudal rami (as long as anal somite in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
, but as long as three last urosomites combined in the new species), number of segments of the female antennule (eight segments in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
, but seven segments in the new species), armature complement of P1 EXP2 (without inner seta in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
, but with inner seta in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. calidafornax</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
), P2 EXP1 (with inner seta in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
, but without inner armature in the new species), and relative length of outermost seta on female P5 endopodal lobe (very small in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
, but well developed in the Mexican species).

            <p>Remarks and discussion.
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
accommodates three species, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. prima</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. secunda</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. wellsi</tp:taxon-name>
. Members of the genus have a preference for shallow brackish conditions with detritus-rich fine sediments (mud and fine sand). The discovery of the female of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. secunda</tp:taxon-name>
in plankton samples from Lake Kolleru (
India
) (
Ranga Reddy 1984
) is, to the best of my knowledge, the only report of a species of this genus from freshwater habitats. 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia prima</tp:taxon-name>
, the first species assigned to this genus, was found in fine sediments (mud or muddy sand) from Saco da Inhaca, a shallow inlet south of Inhaca Island (
Mozambique
) (
Wells 1967
). The male of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. secunda</tp:taxon-name>
, the second species included in this genus, was found in muddy sediments from the estuary of the Vellar river near Parangipettai (formerly Porto Novo) in the 
Tamil Nadu State
(
India
) (
McIntyre 1968
; 
Wells 1971
), and the female was found in a freshwater lake (see above; 
Ranga Reddy 1984
). Finally, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. wellsi</tp:taxon-name>
was found in muddy intertidal sediments from 
South Carolina
(
USA
) (
Coull &amp; Fleeger 1977
).

            <p>
The relationships between 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and some other stenheliins are not clear. 

Dahms 
et al.
(2005)

proposed some apomorphies for 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
(

Dahms 
et al.
2005: 12

, table 2) based on naupliar morphology. They also gave a list of characters shared by 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
viz.
the extremely foreshortened cephalic shield, the presence of a spinous process on the distal third (middle?; 
Huys &amp; Mu 2008
) of the second antennulary segment and a notched inner seta on the third antennulary segment, and a lobate outer protuberance of the first segment of the exopod of the antenna. 
Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
questioned the phylogenetic significance of these characters, but admitted that they appear to be unique within 
<tp:taxon-name>Harpacticoida</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
drew attention to a core group of 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenheliinae</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cladorostrata</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
) sharing a synapomorphic confluent maxillulary exopod and endopod not fused to the supporting basis. This condition is present also in 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
(
Karanovic &amp; Kim 2014
; 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
) and 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia
(
Gómez, 2020
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and is confirmed here for 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
. Note that 
Ranga Reddy (1984)
described the maxillulary rami as discrete and separated from basis, but this is most probably erroneous. The significance of this condition in the maxillulary rami is not clear but 
Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
suggested that the confluent maxillulary rami separated from the basis could be a strong synapomorphy for 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cladorostrata</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
, but also for 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
. However, its presence in some other stenheliin lineages (

e.g. 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
) seems to indicate convergent evolution (see also 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
).

               <tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>

Although its significance is not clear, the caudal seta I is either a spine-like element or a reduced seta in most stenheliins, but it is a well-developed seta (most probably plesiomorphic) in

and

Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
suggested that the resemblance in leg segmentation and armature between 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
observed by 
Itô (1979)
had little phylogenetic significance. However, as noted above (see also Gómez &amp; Barraza 2020), the phylogenetic importance of the confluent maxillulary rami separated from the supporting basis, the shape of caudal seta I, and anal operculum is questionable. On the other hand, the shape of P1 EXP (EXP3 smaller than EXP2 and EXP3), giving the entire ramus a characteristic appearance (except for the somewhat longer P1 EXP 
3 in<tp:taxon-name>P. bathyalis</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
)

, the exceedingly long outer elements of P1 EXP2 and EXP3, and the two-segmented endopod of P2–P4, seem to be strong synapomorphies for these two genera.

The female of the new deep-sea species can be readily separated from the females of its congeners by the segmentation of the antennule (with six segments in the new species, but with five segments in other species), and by its armature complement of P2 ENP2 and P3 ENP2, with five and seven setae instead of four and five setae respectively. The minute proximal endite of the maxillary syncoxa with one seta only, and the reduction of the armature complement on the P5 EXP from six to five setae seem to be the only potential apomorphies for the species.

The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>

Mu &amp; Huys (2002)

<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia aemulaScott, 1893</tp:taxon-name>
and one 
species inquirenda
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia aemula sensuMarinov (1977)</tp:taxon-name>
. According to 
Mu &amp; Huys (2002: 203)
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
does not display any of the seven synapomorphies for 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, but can be defined upon three apomorphies: 1) male P2 ENP2 drawn out into sigmoid finely pinnate process and outer margin with row of long spinules, 2) P4 ENP1 with very long stout seta, and 3) the male P5 EXP incorporated in baseoendopod and outermost seta modified into strong spine. According to 
Mu &amp; Huys (2002)
, the sigmoid process on the male P2 ENP2 of 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
is an apomorphy for the genus. However, the apomorphic status of the long stout inner seta on P4 ENP1 and the fused male P5 EXP and BENP with outermost element modified into a strong spine is uncertain as it is shared by some other stenheliins (see 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
).
</p>
            <p>
The new species proposed here was attributed to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
by the combination of its three-segmented P1 ENP, primitive armature formula of P2 EXP3 (with two inner setae; armature formula 223) and P3 EXP3 (with three inner setae; armature formula 323), and presence of normal setae only on the endopodal lobe of P5. 
Mu &amp; Huys (2002)
suggested that the lack of an inner seta on P1 EXP2 could be a potential synapomorphy for 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
,

but also 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
. However, the presence of an inner seta on P1 EXP 
2 in<tp:taxon-name>B. calidafornax</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
seems to confirm that the lack of an inner seta on P1 EXP 
2 in<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
is likely the result of a secondary loss and cannot be regarded as synapomorphic for 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
,

and 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>B. calidafornax</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
is similar to

, 
<tp:taxon-name>Willenstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
Wellstenvalia
in the retention of one inner seta on P1 EXP2. It is similar also to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. asetosa</tp:taxon-name>
in the loss of the inner seta on P2 EXP1. Interestingly, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. asetosa</tp:taxon-name>
shares the armature formula of P2 EXP (0,1,123) with 
<tp:taxon-name>Willenstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The description of the new species proposed herein confirms that the caudal seta I of 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
is spine-like and this condition is shared, at least, with 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>

            <p>Remarks and discussion.
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
accommodates three species, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. prima</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. secunda</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. wellsi</tp:taxon-name>
. Members of the genus have a preference for shallow brackish conditions with detritus-rich fine sediments (mud and fine sand). The discovery of the female of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. secunda</tp:taxon-name>
in plankton samples from Lake Kolleru (
India
) (
Ranga Reddy 1984
) is, to the best of my knowledge, the only report of a species of this genus from freshwater habitats. 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia prima</tp:taxon-name>
, the first species assigned to this genus, was found in fine sediments (mud or muddy sand) from Saco da Inhaca, a shallow inlet south of Inhaca Island (
Mozambique
) (
Wells 1967
). The male of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. secunda</tp:taxon-name>
, the second species included in this genus, was found in muddy sediments from the estuary of the Vellar river near Parangipettai (formerly Porto Novo) in the 
Tamil Nadu State
(
India
) (
McIntyre 1968
; 
Wells 1971
), and the female was found in a freshwater lake (see above; 
Ranga Reddy 1984
). Finally, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. wellsi</tp:taxon-name>
was found in muddy intertidal sediments from 
South Carolina
(
USA
) (
Coull &amp; Fleeger 1977
).

The relationships between 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and some other stenheliins are not clear. 

Dahms 
et al.
(2005)

proposed some apomorphies for 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
(

Dahms 
et al.
2005: 12

, table 2) based on naupliar morphology. They also gave a list of characters shared by 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
viz.
the extremely foreshortened cephalic shield, the presence of a spinous process on the distal third (middle?; 
Huys &amp; Mu 2008
) of the second antennulary segment and a notched inner seta on the third antennulary segment, and a lobate outer protuberance of the first segment of the exopod of the antenna. 
Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
questioned the phylogenetic significance of these characters, but admitted that they appear to be unique within 
<tp:taxon-name>Harpacticoida</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
drew attention to a core group of 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenheliinae</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cladorostrata</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
) sharing a synapomorphic confluent maxillulary exopod and endopod not fused to the supporting basis. This condition is present also in 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
(
Karanovic &amp; Kim 2014
; 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
) and 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia
(
Gómez, 2020
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and is confirmed here for 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
. Note that 
Ranga Reddy (1984)
described the maxillulary rami as discrete and separated from basis, but this is most probably erroneous. The significance of this condition in the maxillulary rami is not clear but 
Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
suggested that the confluent maxillulary rami separated from the basis could be a strong synapomorphy for 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cladorostrata</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
, but also for 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
. However, its presence in some other stenheliin lineages (

e.g. 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
) seems to indicate convergent evolution (see also 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
).
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
shares a plesiomorphic anal operculum (semicircular, relatively small, weakly chitinized and flanked by a sensilla on each side) with 
<tp:taxon-name>Melima</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia
(
Willen 2003
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, but also with 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
(see also 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
), and it is completely absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia
(
Mu &amp; Huys 2002
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia
(
Huys &amp; Mu 2008
)
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Although its significance is not clear, the caudal seta I is either a spine-like element or a reduced seta in most stenheliins, but it is a well-developed seta (most probably plesiomorphic) in 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, and some species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia
(
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
)
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
In addition to the synapomorphic nature of the structure of the maxillulary rami in 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cladorostrata</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia</tp:taxon-name>
(see above), 
Huys &amp; Mu (2008)
suggested that the resemblance in leg segmentation and armature between 
<tp:taxon-name>Onychostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
observed by 
Itô (1979)
had little phylogenetic significance. However, as noted above (see also Gómez &amp; Barraza 2020), the phylogenetic importance of the confluent maxillulary rami separated from the supporting basis, the shape of caudal seta I, and anal operculum is questionable. On the other hand, the shape of P1 EXP (EXP3 smaller than EXP2 and EXP3), giving the entire ramus a characteristic appearance (except for the somewhat longer P1 EXP 
3 in<tp:taxon-name>P. bathyalis</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
)

, the exceedingly long outer elements of P1 EXP2 and EXP3, and the two-segmented endopod of P2–P4, seem to be strong synapomorphies for these two genera.
</p>
            <p>
Both sexes are known for all 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudostenhelia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
except for 
<tp:taxon-name>P. bathyalis</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
The female of the new deep-sea species can be readily separated from the females of its congeners by the segmentation of the antennule (with six segments in the new species, but with five segments in other species), and by its armature complement of P2 ENP2 and P3 ENP2, with five and seven setae instead of four and five setae respectively. The minute proximal endite of the maxillary syncoxa with one seta only, and the reduction of the armature complement on the P5 EXP from six to five setae seem to be the only potential apomorphies for the species.

            <p>Etymology.
According to one of several theories, the name 
California
comes from the Old Spanish Calit Fornay, an alteration of the Latin 
calida fornax
, hot furnace. The specific epithet makes reference to the region where the species was found. It is to be treated as a noun in apposition.

            <p>Remarks and discussion.
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
was reinstated by 
Mu &amp; Huys (2002)
to reallocate 
<tp:taxon-name>Delavalia aemulaScott, 1893</tp:taxon-name>
and one 
species inquirenda
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia aemula sensuMarinov (1977)</tp:taxon-name>
. According to 
Mu &amp; Huys (2002: 203)
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
does not display any of the seven synapomorphies for 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, but can be defined upon three apomorphies: 1) male P2 ENP2 drawn out into sigmoid finely pinnate process and outer margin with row of long spinules, 2) P4 ENP1 with very long stout seta, and 3) the male P5 EXP incorporated in baseoendopod and outermost seta modified into strong spine. According to 
Mu &amp; Huys (2002)
, the sigmoid process on the male P2 ENP2 of 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
is an apomorphy for the genus. However, the apomorphic status of the long stout inner seta on P4 ENP1 and the fused male P5 EXP and BENP with outermost element modified into a strong spine is uncertain as it is shared by some other stenheliins (see 
Gómez &amp; Cruz-Barraza 2021
).
</p>
            <p>
The new species proposed here was attributed to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
by the combination of its three-segmented P1 ENP, primitive armature formula of P2 EXP3 (with two inner setae; armature formula 223) and P3 EXP3 (with three inner setae; armature formula 323), and presence of normal setae only on the endopodal lobe of P5. 
Mu &amp; Huys (2002)
suggested that the lack of an inner seta on P1 EXP2 could be a potential synapomorphy for 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
,

but also 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
. However, the presence of an inner seta on P1 EXP 
2 in<tp:taxon-name>B. calidafornax</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
seems to confirm that the lack of an inner seta on P1 EXP 
2 in<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
is likely the result of a secondary loss and cannot be regarded as synapomorphic for 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
,

and 
<tp:taxon-name>Stenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
- 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
. On the other hand, 
<tp:taxon-name>B. calidafornax</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>Itostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Willenstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Wellstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
Wellstenvalia
in the retention of one inner seta on P1 EXP2. It is similar also to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. asetosa</tp:taxon-name>
in the loss of the inner seta on P2 EXP1. Interestingly, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. asetosa</tp:taxon-name>
shares the armature formula of P2 EXP (0,1,123) with 
<tp:taxon-name>Willenstenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The description of the new species proposed herein confirms that the caudal seta I of 
<tp:taxon-name>Beatricella</tp:taxon-name>
is spine-like and this condition is shared, at least, with 
<tp:taxon-name>Anisostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cladorostrata</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Itostenhelia</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Lonchoeidestenhelia</tp:taxon-name>

The male of 
<tp:taxon-name>B. calidafornax</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
remains unknown, but this species can be readily separated from 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
by the relative length of caudal rami (as long as anal somite in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
, but as long as three last urosomites combined in the new species), number of segments of the female antennule (eight segments in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>B. calidafornax</tp:taxon-name>

), P2 EXP1 (with inner seta in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. aemula</tp:taxon-name>
, but without inner armature in the new species), and relative length of outermost seta on female P5 endopodal lobe (very small in
