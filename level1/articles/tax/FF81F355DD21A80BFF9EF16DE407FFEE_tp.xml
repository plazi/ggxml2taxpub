Examination of material from the Campeche region of the southern Gulf of Mexico revealed the presence of a new genus and species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Apseudidae</tp:taxon-name>
that appears to be transitional between 
<tp:taxon-name>Bunakenia
Guţu
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Apseudes
Leach
</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sensu lato</named-content>
.

This new taxon, 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudobunakenia anablesis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. gen., n. sp.</named-content>
is found throughout the Gulf of Mexico (
GOM
) and Northwest Atlantic as far north as South Carolina. It is known in the literature under the designation “ 
<tp:taxon-name>Apseudes spinosa”
Sars 
sensu
Dawson
</tp:taxon-name>
and “ 
<tp:taxon-name>Apseudes
sp. A
</tp:taxon-name>
” (
Heardet al.
). Also, 
<tp:taxon-name>Bunakenia hamata</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
is described from offshore Georgia and is distributed from the Florida Gulf Coast and the Northwest Atlantic as far north as South Carolina. It is known in the literature under the designation “ 
<tp:taxon-name>Bunakenia
sp. A
</tp:taxon-name>
” (
Heardet al.
) and is the only known species of that genus in the 
GOM
/ NW Atlantic. It can be distinguished from its congeners by a combination of characters such as the pereonites having posterolateral apophyses, the antennule first peduncle article denticulate, the antennule accessory flagellum having five articles, and the first pereopod having four ventral propodal spiniform setae. A key to the known species is presented.

Much of the coastal and shelf areas in 
Mexico
have been unexplored due to the lack of research funding or coastal infrastructure to support biological field studies (

Fautin 
et al
. 2010

). Until recently, only one tanaidacean species, the parapseudid 
<tp:taxon-name>Discapseudes mexicanusGuţu, 2006</tp:taxon-name>
, was known from the southwestern Gulf of 
Mexico
, off 
Veracruz
, 
Mexico
(
Heard
&amp; Anderson 2009

). 

Cházaro-Olvera 
et al.
(2018)

reported 30 species from 
Veracruz
, and 

Abarca-Ávila 
et al.
(2019)

reported 23 species from the 
Yucatan
Peninsula, including the apseudid 
<tp:taxon-name>Paradoxapseudes bermudeus
(
Băcescu, 1980
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, and a new species belonging to an apparently undescribed species of 
<tp:taxon-name>ParapseudesSars, 1882</tp:taxon-name>
. In the same year, based on specimens from 
Quintana Roo
, 
Jarquín-González &amp; Carrera-Parra (2019)
described a new species belonging to the leptocheliid genus 
<tp:taxon-name>HargeriaLang, 1973</tp:taxon-name>
, and later (
Jarquín-González &amp; Carrera-Parra 2022
) described two new species of the leptocheliid genus 
<tp:taxon-name>ChondrocheliaGuţu, 2016</tp:taxon-name>
, one from 
Veracruz
, 
Mexico
, and the other from 
Quintana Roo
, 
Mexico
.

The tanaidacean fauna from the Campeche region is relatively unknown. 

Drumm &amp; 
Heard
(2022)

recently described a new parapseudid genus and species from that region. Examination of that same material revealed another tanaidacean taxon new to science, previously known under the designation “ 
<tp:taxon-name>Apseudes spinosa”
Sars 
sensuDawson (1966)</tp:taxon-name>
from off Louisiana and “ 
<tp:taxon-name>Apseudes
sp. A
</tp:taxon-name>
” (see 
Heardet al.
2004

) from other regions of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Bight as far north as South Carolina. A new genus is erected, and an illustrated description of the new species is presented below.
</p>
         <p>
Species within the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>BunakeniaGuţu, 1995</tp:taxon-name>
are found in 
Australia
, western Indian Ocean (
Tanzania
), Indo-Pacific, SW Atlantic (
Brazil
), and 
GOM
/NW Atlantic in depths of &lt;
200m
.

The genus is distinguished from other members of the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Apseudidae</tp:taxon-name>
most notably by the presence of a wide gap in the fingers of the male chelae (
Guţu, 2006
). Material identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>Bunakenia
sp. A
</tp:taxon-name>
(
sensuHeardet al.
2004

) off 
Georgia
at a depth of 
58 m
is formally described and illustrated and an identification key to the known species is presented.
</p>
         <p>
The 
<tp:taxon-name>
Apseudidae 
Leach, 1814</tp:taxon-name>
is considered the most plesiomorphic tanaidacean family (

Błażewicz-Paszkowycz 
et al.
2012

) and its systematics is fraught with numerous problems. This stems from the poor original description of the 
type
genus and species, 
<tp:taxon-name>Apseudes talpa
(
Montagu, 1808
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and caused the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>ApseudesLeach, 1814</tp:taxon-name>
to be a catch-all taxon. Subsequent studies have made attempts to rectify some of these problems by erecting new genera (e.g., 
Norman 1899
; 
Lang 1968
; 
Guţu 1995
, 
2002
, 
2006
; 
Jóźwiak 2014
), and 

Larsen 
et al.
(2011)

redescribed 
<tp:taxon-name>A. talpa</tp:taxon-name>
but unfortunately did not update the list of 
<tp:taxon-name>Apseudes
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, apart from implicitly including those of 
<tp:taxon-name>AndrogynellaGuţu, 2006</tp:taxon-name>
(by synonymy), thus causing the genus to remain a heterogenous taxon. Another genus, 
<tp:taxon-name>ApseudopsisNorman, 1899</tp:taxon-name>
, includes species that conflict with the diagnostic characters (
Guţu 2006
). It is thus clear that revisionary work is still needed in order to create some stability within the family, and this is illustrated by the fact that there has been no working key to the genera of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Apseudidae</tp:taxon-name>
since 
Guţu (1981)
. The family currently contains three subfamilies and 25 genera (WoRMS 2020) and has a cosmopolitan distribution occurring from the intertidal zone to the deep sea (
Heardet al.
2004

).

at depths of 

57– 
58 m
.

         <p>
Measurements of body length were made from the tip of the rostrum to the apex of the pleotelson. The width of the body was made at the broadest section of the cephalothorax. Drawings were made with the aid of a drawing tube mounted on a WILD M12 microscope. Photographs were made with a Leica EC3 camera. Descriptions of the body are based on 
holotype
material and those of dissected appendages are taken from 
paratypes
. Terminology is similar to that of 
Larsen (2003)
although the term ‘PSS’ (pinnate sensory seta) is used instead of ‘broom seta,’ and we recognize the peduncle/flagellum division for the antennule/antenna. Type material is deposited at the Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History, 
Washington
, D.C. (
USNM
).

One preparatory female has six ventral spiniform setae on the propodus of pereopod 1. The 
allotype
male has four plumose setae on the dorsal margin of the carpus of pereopod 6 and one and three spiniform setae on the ventral margin of the merus and carpus, respectively. One male has two plumose setae proximally on the dorsal margin of the pereopod 6 basis. Plumose setae were not observed in other specimens, so it is not clear if these setae are easily broken off or if it was an anomaly, although specimens from 
South Carolina
have several plumose setae on the dorsal margin of the pereopod 6 basis (

). Some adult females from Tampa Bay and 
South Carolina
had five plumose setae on the dorsal margin of the carpus of pereopod 6.

: 1) has the inner flagellum of the antennule 4 articulate, and 2) the merus and carpus of pereopod 6 lack plumose setae. It is possible that his specimens either had these setae broken off or that he just did not observe the setules, so the status is uncertain until topotypical material can be examined.

One preparatory female has six ventral spiniform setae on the propodus of pereopod 1. The 
allotype
male has four plumose setae on the dorsal margin of the carpus of pereopod 6 and one and three spiniform setae on the ventral margin of the merus and carpus, respectively. One male has two plumose setae proximally on the dorsal margin of the pereopod 6 basis. Plumose setae were not observed in other specimens, so it is not clear if these setae are easily broken off or if it was an anomaly, although specimens from 
South Carolina
have several plumose setae on the dorsal margin of the pereopod 6 basis (

). Some adult females from Tampa Bay and 
South Carolina
had five plumose setae on the dorsal margin of the carpus of pereopod 6.

            <p>Intraspecific variation.
One preparatory female has six ventral spiniform setae on the propodus of pereopod 1. The 
allotype
male has four plumose setae on the dorsal margin of the carpus of pereopod 6 and one and three spiniform setae on the ventral margin of the merus and carpus, respectively. One male has two plumose setae proximally on the dorsal margin of the pereopod 6 basis. Plumose setae were not observed in other specimens, so it is not clear if these setae are easily broken off or if it was an anomaly, although specimens from 
South Carolina
have several plumose setae on the dorsal margin of the pereopod 6 basis (

). Some adult females from Tampa Bay and 
South Carolina
had five plumose setae on the dorsal margin of the carpus of pereopod 6.

: 1) has the inner flagellum of the antennule 4 articulate, and 2) the merus and carpus of pereopod 6 lack plumose setae.

One preparatory female has six ventral spiniform setae on the propodus of pereopod 1. The 
allotype
male has four plumose setae on the dorsal margin of the carpus of pereopod 6 and one and three spiniform setae on the ventral margin of the merus and carpus, respectively. One male has two plumose setae proximally on the dorsal margin of the pereopod 6 basis. Plumose setae were not observed in other specimens, so it is not clear if these setae are easily broken off or if it was an anomaly, although specimens from 
South Carolina
have several plumose setae on the dorsal margin of the pereopod 6 basis (

). Some adult females from Tampa Bay and 
South Carolina
had five plumose setae on the dorsal margin of the carpus of pereopod 6.
