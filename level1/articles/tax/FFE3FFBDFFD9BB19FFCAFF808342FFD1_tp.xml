Two new species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella
Fitzhugh &amp; Rouse,

are described from eastern 
Australia

1977
on the outer Barrier Reef near Lizard Island, Queensland. 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella fitzhughi</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, was found alive in burrows in and among spirorbin serpulid tubes on intertidal rocks in Tasmania in 
1996
. Both species were found in mucoid tubes, and brood their young in a manner similar to the only other described species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata

. 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, is exceptional as it possesses a 
type
of thoracic neurochaetal uncinus different from the other two species, and which is similar to the notochaetal acicular “palmate hook” seen in 
<tp:taxon-name>Caobangia</tp:taxon-name>
. Descriptions of both species are given, and the diagnosis for 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
is emended. Larval and chaetal morphology and relationships among of the three known 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
spp. are discussed.

            <tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella heterouncinata
Fitzhugh &amp; Rouse, 
1999</tp:taxon-name>
is a small sabellid (&lt;
5 mm
long) and is endemic to 
South Africa
, living in burrows on the shells of gastropods. It has become a pest on cultured abalone in 
South Africa
and California (

Kuris &amp; Culver 
1999
; 

Ruck &amp; Cook 
1998
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
larvae settle on the growing edge of the host shell and the host covers it with nacreous shell (

Kuris &amp; Culver 
1999
) resulting in the burrow. It is a simultaneous hermaphrodite, with sperm storage, and is an intratubular brooder (

Fitzhugh &amp; Rouse 
1999
; Simon 
2004
; 

Simon &amp; Rouse 
2005
). Other aspects of its biology have been investigated (

) making 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
one of the best-studied annelids. Here, two new species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
are described from eastern 
Australia
. 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, was collected from coral rubble at 
9– 30m
depth from Yonge Reef on the outer Great Barrier Reef, Queensland. 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella fitzhughi</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, was extracted mostly from spirorbin serpulid tubes adhering to intertidal rocks in Tasmania. Additionally, a few specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. fitzhughi</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, were also discovered on Outer Yonge Reef, Queensland samples. Both species show similarities in morphology, reproduction and ecology with the 
type
species 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
. The relationships of the three 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
species are discussed.

<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
were also examined, in order to compare them with the species described herein. These 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
specimens were collected by L. Harris, in 

Dec 
1993
, from “Bodega Farms” Abalone Aquaculture Facility, Bodega Bay, California 
USA
.
</p>
         <p>
Specimens for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were dehydrated in ethanol, critical-point-dried with CO 
2
and gold-sputter-coated before viewing with a Cambridge Instruments S 
120
SEM (
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>

VP SEM (
<tp:taxon-name>T. fitzhughi</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
). All descriptions are based on the 
holotype
unless stated otherwise, and the variation within 
paratypes
or additional material examined is given in the variation section. All specimens were deposited at the Australian Museum (AM) in Sydney, 
Australia
.
</p>
         <p>
The terminology used for description of chaetal morphology is mostly that of 

Fitzhugh and Rouse, 
1999
(except see Taxonomic Account Remarks, below). A cladistic analysis was done using 
PAUP
* 4.0b 
10
(

Swofford 
2002
) to help resolve relationships among the three 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
species and to assess the monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
.

This diagnosis is slightly altered from that of 

Fitzhugh and Rouse (

)

. 

Fitzhugh (
2003
)

argued for a reinterpretation of the dorsal lips of sabellids and that 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
has radiolar appendages. This is accepted here. Also, after examination of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
specimens we must conclude that the description of the superior thoracic capillary chaetae as “narrowly-hooded” in 

Fitzhugh &amp; Rouse (
1999
)

, (

A,B), is not an accurate reflection of the shape, as all thoracic capillary notochaetae appear to have distinct ‘bilateral’ swelling of the hood, arising either side above the handle, the more elongate superior ones as well as the shorter inferior chaetae. Specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>T. fitzhughi</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, also possess the same chaetae. This is seen particularly well under SEM examination (see 

C). We propose that these chaetae are more accurately described as “broadly-hooded” (sensu 

Fitzhugh, 
1989

E,F). The variability of shape in the uncini of chaetiger two across the three

Specimens exhibit different degrees of torsion of the body and there is a large variation in the degree of elongation/contraction longitudinally.

50–56
uncini. The variation in the number of rasp-shaped uncini per row on chaetiger 
8
is 
11– 15
. Some specimens (AM 

W 
29453
, 

W 
29457
) have two large palmate uncini per fascicle in the 
2
nd chaetiger. The presence of “palmate” uncini in chaetiger

is a unique feature for 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, and are absent from the two other known species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
. The expanded lateral teeth of the acicular uncini is a feature shared with 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
. The “palmate” uncini of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, and the rows of avicular uncini in chaetigers 
7–8
of all 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
spp. are remarkable and unlike any other sabellids, except for 
<tp:taxon-name>Caobangia</tp:taxon-name>
spp. (

Jones

does suggest a sister group relationship with 
<tp:taxon-name>Caobangia</tp:taxon-name>
for 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>

, have two lateral teeth that are very enlarged shows some similarities to the acicular uncini of chaetigers 
3–6
and to those of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>

2–3
acicular homodont-crested abdominal-type uncini (with smaller teeth) dorsally. Another juvenile specimen of approximately 
0.5 mm
length has 
11
chaetigers, but again, no branchial crown, one anterior achaetigerous segment, and two posterior achaetigerous segments. The rasp-toothed avicular uncini are absent from this specimen and all neurochaetal uncini on chaetigers

F). There is some variation in the numbers of the different 
types
of chaetae.
</p>
            <p>
Neuropodial companion chaetae vary in number (
1–2
) on thorax, and there does not appear to be any consistency in their number on any one chaetiger, even with size, although examination of more specimens may find some correlation of number with size. The number of rasp-shaped uncini on chaetiger 
7
varies from ~ 
12– 24
per row. On chaetiger 
8
the number varies from 
5–14
per row. SEM examination showed that there are basically three 
types
of capillary chaetae: the broadly-hooded capillary chaetae present in the superior position of the thoracic notopodia (

C); the shorter broadly-hooded capillary notochaetae in the inferior position of the thoracic fascicles (

C) and the long, narrowly-hooded capillary chaetae present in abdominal fascicles (

B). However, some specimens also possess in the thoracic fascicle on chaetiger 
8
, a smaller “whiptail” capillary chaeta and a minute “setule” in a superior position (

G), both of which may be newlyemerging notochaetae.

While we could discern no difference between the specimens of

               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, from Tasmania and those from the northern Great Barrier Reef, the great distance separating them and the fact that 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
brood larvae (

Fitzhugh &amp; Rouse

) suggests they may represent more than one species. Further collections and analysis of molecular sequence data may resolve this issue.

This diagnosis is slightly altered from that of 

Fitzhugh and Rouse (

. 

Fitzhugh (
2003
)

argued for a reinterpretation of the dorsal lips of sabellids and that 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
has radiolar appendages. This is accepted here. Also, after examination of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
specimens we must conclude that the description of the superior thoracic capillary chaetae as “narrowly-hooded” in 

Fitzhugh &amp; Rouse (
1999
)

, (

A,B), is not an accurate reflection of the shape, as all thoracic capillary notochaetae appear to have distinct ‘bilateral’ swelling of the hood, arising either side above the handle, the more elongate superior ones as well as the shorter inferior chaetae. Specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>

, and 
<tp:taxon-name>T. fitzhughi</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, also possess the same chaetae. This is seen particularly well under SEM examination (see 

C). We propose that these chaetae are more accurately described as “broadly-hooded” (sensu 

Fitzhugh,

50–56

. Some specimens (AM 

W 
29453
, 

W

<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, and are absent from the two other known species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
. The expanded lateral teeth of the acicular uncini is a feature shared with 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, and the rows of avicular uncini in chaetigers 
7–8
of all 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
spp. are remarkable and unlike any other sabellids, except for 
<tp:taxon-name>Caobangia</tp:taxon-name>

</p>
            <p>Variations/Remarks.
There were different degrees of longitudinal body contraction and torsion exhibited in the range of specimens examined. Size range examined: 
0.3 to 2.8 mm
in length, including two juveniles of 
0.3 mm
and 
0.57 mm
long (no branchial crowns). Juveniles up to an eight-chaetiger stage had no crown developed and are ~ 
0.3 mm
in length (

E). Companion chaetae are absent, chaetigers 
2–5
have a single acicular homodont-crested thoracic-type neurochaetal uncinus on some (not all) segments, chaetigers 
6–7
have a few rasp-toothed avicular uncini as neurochaetae, and chaetiger 
8
has 
2–3
acicular homodont-crested abdominal-type uncini (with smaller teeth) dorsally. Another juvenile specimen of approximately 
0.5 mm
length has 
11
chaetigers, but again, no branchial crown, one anterior achaetigerous segment, and two posterior achaetigerous segments. The rasp-toothed avicular uncini are absent from this specimen and all neurochaetal uncini on chaetigers 
2–7
are of the acicular crested thoracic-type, whereas the uncini on chaetigers 
8–11
are of the acicular homodont-crested abdominal-type, with a reversal from ventral to dorsal position from chaetigers 
9 to 10
. There also appears to be a greater number of these abdominal uncini embedded deeply into these last 
2
chaetigers of the abdomen (

F). There is some variation in the numbers of the different 
types
of chaetae.
</p>
            <p>
Neuropodial companion chaetae vary in number (
1–2
) on thorax, and there does not appear to be any consistency in their number on any one chaetiger, even with size, although examination of more specimens may find some correlation of number with size. The number of rasp-shaped uncini on chaetiger 
7
varies from ~ 
12– 24
per row. On chaetiger 
8
the number varies from 
5–14
per row. SEM examination showed that there are basically three 
types
of capillary chaetae: the broadly-hooded capillary chaetae present in the superior position of the thoracic notopodia (

C); the shorter broadly-hooded capillary notochaetae in the inferior position of the thoracic fascicles (

C) and the long, narrowly-hooded capillary chaetae present in abdominal fascicles (

B). However, some specimens also possess in the thoracic fascicle on chaetiger 
8
, a smaller “whiptail” capillary chaeta and a minute “setule” in a superior position (

G), both of which may be newlyemerging notochaetae.

.

Small-bodied species with eight thoracic and three abdominal chaetigers. Branchial crown with two pairs of radioles, pinnules pectinately arranged. Palmate membrane, radiolar flanges and radiolar eyes absent. Dorsal lips elongate with radiolar appendages. Ventral lips, parallel lamellae, and ventral sacs absent. Branchial skeleton present, with two rows of cells. Branchial lobes fused along dorsal midline. Ventral margins of branchial lobes with ventral basal flanges. Anterior peristomial ring indistinct; separation of anterior and posterior peristomial rings indistinguishable. Peristomial and pygidial eyespots absent. Posterior peristomial ring collar present, incised mid-dorsally and ventrally. Glandular ridge in chaetiger two absent. Thoracic notochaetae broadly-hooded capillaries (sensu

has radiolar appendages. This is accepted here. Also, after examination of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
specimens we must conclude that the description of the superior thoracic capillary chaetae as “narrowly-hooded” in 

Fitzhugh &amp; Rouse (
1999
)

, (

A,B), is not an accurate reflection of the shape, as all thoracic capillary notochaetae appear to have distinct ‘bilateral’ swelling of the hood, arising either side above the handle, the more elongate superior ones as well as the shorter inferior chaetae. Specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>T. fitzhughi</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, also possess the same chaetae. This is seen particularly well under SEM examination (see 

C). We propose that these chaetae are more accurately described as “broadly-hooded” (sensu 

Fitzhugh, 
1989
, Fig, 
22
E,F). The variability of shape in the uncini of chaetiger two across the three 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>

50–56
uncini. The variation in the number of rasp-shaped uncini per row on chaetiger 
8
is 
11– 15
. Some specimens (AM 

W

, 

W

<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, and are absent from the two other known species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
. The expanded lateral teeth of the acicular uncini is a feature shared with 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
. The “palmate” uncini of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, and the rows of avicular uncini in chaetigers 
7–8
of all 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
spp. are remarkable and unlike any other sabellids, except for 
<tp:taxon-name>Caobangia</tp:taxon-name>

</p>
            <p>Variations/Remarks.
There were different degrees of longitudinal body contraction and torsion exhibited in the range of specimens examined. Size range examined: 
0.3 to 2.8 mm
in length, including two juveniles of 
0.3 mm
and 
0.57 mm
long (no branchial crowns). Juveniles up to an eight-chaetiger stage had no crown developed and are ~ 
0.3 mm
in length (

E). Companion chaetae are absent, chaetigers 
2–5
have a single acicular homodont-crested thoracic-type neurochaetal uncinus on some (not all) segments, chaetigers 
6–7
have a few rasp-toothed avicular uncini as neurochaetae, and chaetiger 
8
has 
2–3
acicular homodont-crested abdominal-type uncini (with smaller teeth) dorsally. Another juvenile specimen of approximately 
0.5 mm
length has 
11
chaetigers, but again, no branchial crown, one anterior achaetigerous segment, and two posterior achaetigerous segments. The rasp-toothed avicular uncini are absent from this specimen and all neurochaetal uncini on chaetigers 
2–7
are of the acicular crested thoracic-type, whereas the uncini on chaetigers 
8–11
are of the acicular homodont-crested abdominal-type, with a reversal from ventral to dorsal position from chaetigers 
9 to 10
. There also appears to be a greater number of these abdominal uncini embedded deeply into these last 
2
chaetigers of the abdomen (

F). There is some variation in the numbers of the different 
types
of chaetae.
</p>
            <p>
Neuropodial companion chaetae vary in number (
1–2
) on thorax, and there does not appear to be any consistency in their number on any one chaetiger, even with size, although examination of more specimens may find some correlation of number with size. The number of rasp-shaped uncini on chaetiger 
7
varies from ~ 
12– 24
per row. On chaetiger 
8
the number varies from 
5–14
per row. SEM examination showed that there are basically three 
types
of capillary chaetae: the broadly-hooded capillary chaetae present in the superior position of the thoracic notopodia (

C); the shorter broadly-hooded capillary notochaetae in the inferior position of the thoracic fascicles (

C) and the long, narrowly-hooded capillary chaetae present in abdominal fascicles (

B). However, some specimens also possess in the thoracic fascicle on chaetiger 
8
, a smaller “whiptail” capillary chaeta and a minute “setule” in a superior position (

G), both of which may be newlyemerging notochaetae.

.

Small-bodied species with eight thoracic and three abdominal chaetigers. Branchial crown with two pairs of radioles, pinnules pectinately arranged. Palmate membrane, radiolar flanges and radiolar eyes absent. Dorsal lips elongate with radiolar appendages. Ventral lips, parallel lamellae, and ventral sacs absent. Branchial skeleton present, with two rows of cells. Branchial lobes fused along dorsal midline. Ventral margins of branchial lobes with ventral basal flanges. Anterior peristomial ring indistinct; separation of anterior and posterior peristomial rings indistinguishable. Peristomial and pygidial eyespots absent. Posterior peristomial ring collar present, incised mid-dorsally and ventrally. Glandular ridge in chaetiger two absent. Thoracic notochaetae broadly-hooded capillaries (sensu 

Fitzhugh 
1989
), arranged in two rows, superior chaetae longer than those in inferior row. Two or three 
types
of thoracic neuropodial uncini present in chaetigers 
2–8
. Uncini in chaetiger 
2
either 
2–4
long-handled uncini with small breast (= acicular), with a main fang surmounted by a series of homodont or heterodont teeth, or 
1–2
acicular uncini which have a large gap between the large main fang and the semicircle of smaller distal teeth, with one pair slightly larger than the other teeth in the crest (=“palmate”sensu 

Jones 
1974
); uncini of chaetigers 
3–6
acicular, similar to the hetero- or homodont uncini present in chaetiger 
2
; breast of uncini either a small swelling or moderately well-developed. Uncini in chaetigers 
7–8
, Z-shaped with breast and handle (= avicular), all teeth uniform in size and arranged in narrow elongate rasp-shaped rows; breast well-developed; handles of medium length. Companion chaetae present in neuropodia of chaetigers 
2–6
, absent in chaetigers 
7-8
. Abdominal notopodial uncini in chaetigers 
9–11
acicular, either with distinct main fang surmounted by series of hetero- or homodont teeth, or a similar smaller version of the “palmate” uncinus of chaetiger 
2
; breast poorly- to well-developed. Abdominal neurochaetae narrowly-hooded capillaries. Simultaneous hermaphrodites; direct-developing young brooded in burrow.

            <p>Remarks.
This diagnosis is slightly altered from that of 

Fitzhugh and Rouse (
1999
)

. 

Fitzhugh (
2003
)

argued for a reinterpretation of the dorsal lips of sabellids and that 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
has radiolar appendages. This is accepted here. Also, after examination of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
specimens we must conclude that the description of the superior thoracic capillary chaetae as “narrowly-hooded” in 

Fitzhugh &amp; Rouse (
1999
)

, (

A,B), is not an accurate reflection of the shape, as all thoracic capillary notochaetae appear to have distinct ‘bilateral’ swelling of the hood, arising either side above the handle, the more elongate superior ones as well as the shorter inferior chaetae. Specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>T. fitzhughi</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, also possess the same chaetae. This is seen particularly well under SEM examination (see 

C). We propose that these chaetae are more accurately described as “broadly-hooded” (sensu 

Fitzhugh, 
1989
, Fig, 
22
E,F). The variability of shape in the uncini of chaetiger two across the three 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
spp. is reflected in the diagnosis.

            <p>Variations/Remarks.
Specimens exhibit different degrees of torsion of the body and there is a large variation in the degree of elongation/contraction longitudinally. All specimens are fragile, with thin body walls that are easily damaged. There is some variation in the number of rasp-shaped uncini per row on chaetiger 
7
, ranging from 
50–56
uncini. The variation in the number of rasp-shaped uncini per row on chaetiger 
8
is 
11– 15
. Some specimens (AM 

W 
29453
, 

W 
29457
) have two large palmate uncini per fascicle in the 
2
nd chaetiger. The presence of “palmate” uncini in chaetiger 
2
is a unique feature for 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, and are absent from the two other known species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
. The expanded lateral teeth of the acicular uncini is a feature shared with 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
. The “palmate” uncini of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, and the rows of avicular uncini in chaetigers 
7–8
of all 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
spp. are remarkable and unlike any other sabellids, except for 
<tp:taxon-name>Caobangia</tp:taxon-name>
spp. (

Jones 
1974
). Further investigation is required to properly assess this homology hypothesis, but 

Fitzhugh (
2003
)

does suggest a sister group relationship with 
<tp:taxon-name>Caobangia</tp:taxon-name>
for 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
. The fact the “palmate” uncini of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, have two lateral teeth that are very enlarged shows some similarities to the acicular uncini of chaetigers 
3–6
and to those of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
. On some specimens, the faecal groove appears to bifurcate on chaetiger

7–11
. Faecal groove lined with elongate cilia along sides (

D). The anus opens dorsally, subterminally.
</p>
            <p>Variations/Remarks.
There were different degrees of longitudinal body contraction and torsion exhibited in the range of specimens examined. Size range examined: 
0.3 to 2.8 mm
in length, including two juveniles of 
0.3 mm
and 
0.57 mm
long (no branchial crowns). Juveniles up to an eight-chaetiger stage had no crown developed and are ~ 
0.3 mm
in length (

E). Companion chaetae are absent, chaetigers 
2–5
have a single acicular homodont-crested thoracic-type neurochaetal uncinus on some (not all) segments, chaetigers 
6–7
have a few rasp-toothed avicular uncini as neurochaetae, and chaetiger 
8
has 
2–3
acicular homodont-crested abdominal-type uncini (with smaller teeth) dorsally. Another juvenile specimen of approximately 
0.5 mm
length has 
11
chaetigers, but again, no branchial crown, one anterior achaetigerous segment, and two posterior achaetigerous segments. The rasp-toothed avicular uncini are absent from this specimen and all neurochaetal uncini on chaetigers 
2–7
are of the acicular crested thoracic-type, whereas the uncini on chaetigers 
8–11
are of the acicular homodont-crested abdominal-type, with a reversal from ventral to dorsal position from chaetigers 
9 to 10
. There also appears to be a greater number of these abdominal uncini embedded deeply into these last 
2
chaetigers of the abdomen (

F). There is some variation in the numbers of the different 
types
of chaetae.
</p>
            <p>
Neuropodial companion chaetae vary in number (
1–2
) on thorax, and there does not appear to be any consistency in their number on any one chaetiger, even with size, although examination of more specimens may find some correlation of number with size. The number of rasp-shaped uncini on chaetiger 
7
varies from ~ 
12– 24
per row. On chaetiger 
8
the number varies from 
5–14
per row. SEM examination showed that there are basically three 
types
of capillary chaetae: the broadly-hooded capillary chaetae present in the superior position of the thoracic notopodia (

C); the shorter broadly-hooded capillary notochaetae in the inferior position of the thoracic fascicles (

C) and the long, narrowly-hooded capillary chaetae present in abdominal fascicles (

B). However, some specimens also possess in the thoracic fascicle on chaetiger 
8
, a smaller “whiptail” capillary chaeta and a minute “setule” in a superior position (

G), both of which may be newlyemerging notochaetae.

<tp:taxon-name>Amphiglena
Claparède,

found that

was sister group to 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
supported by three non-reproductive and two reproductive synapomorphies. 

Fitzhugh (

has recently shown that

Fitzhugh (
1989
)

discussed uncinal 
types
in sabellids and preferred not use the terms acicular and avicular. The former he defined as having long handles that are gently curved, proximal extensions of the distal dentate end. He defined avicular uncini as characteristically Z-shaped or swan-shaped with the handle sharply bent below the main fang with the proximal part of the handle oriented about 
90
° relative to the distal part. However, the terms cover a wide variety of forms and so for cladistic analysis he broke up the features of uncini into several characters based on dentition, breast development and handle length. The terms acicular and avicular have been used throughout this paper, but with clear definitions. 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Brandtika</tp:taxon-name>
Jones, 
1974
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Potaspina
Hartman, 
1969</tp:taxon-name>
are the only sabellid genera to show two dramatically different sets of neuropodial uncini. In 
<tp:taxon-name>Potaspina</tp:taxon-name>
the anterior thoracic chaetigers have avicular uncini in chaetigers 
2–5
and the acicular uncini in most remaining thoracic chaetigers (

Fitzhugh &amp; Rouse 
1999
; 

Hartman 
1969
). In 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
there are acicular uncini in chaetigers 
2–6
and chaetigers 
7
and 
8
have avicular uncini with rasp-shaped dentition and medium handles. 
<tp:taxon-name>Brandtika</tp:taxon-name>
shows a difference between the acicular uncini of chaetigers 
2–5
compared to the presence of ‘pilose hooks’ in chaetigers 
6
and 
8
(

Jones 
1974
), but the difference is not dramatic and currently this genus would appear to be best placed in 
<tp:taxon-name>Fabriciinae</tp:taxon-name>
. In other sabellids, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>Amphiglena</tp:taxon-name>
, where thoracic uncini are present they are essentially the same in each chaetiger along the thorax. 
<tp:taxon-name>Caobangia</tp:taxon-name>
is unique in lacking thoracic uncini in chaetigers 
2–8
.

         <p>
0: Present chaetigers

</p>
         <p>1
: Absent.

</p>
         <p>
Companion chaetae are found in front of the thoracic uncini in a number of 
<tp:taxon-name>Sabellinae</tp:taxon-name>
and are usually found in chaetigers 
2–8
. However, in 
<tp:taxon-name>Calcisabella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Potaspina</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
they are found in a more limited number of thoracic chaetigers. In 
<tp:taxon-name>Calcisabella</tp:taxon-name>
the companion chaetae are found from chaetigers 
4–8
(

Perkins 
1991
). In 
<tp:taxon-name>Potaspina</tp:taxon-name>
they are present in chaetigers 
2–4
only (

Hartman 
1969
) and in all 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
species they are present in chaetigers 
2–6
. In 
<tp:taxon-name>Caobangia</tp:taxon-name>
, as in many other sabellids, companion chaetae are absent.

         <p>0: Avicular with short to medium handles, large breast.</p>
         <p>1
: Long-handled with small breast (= acicular).
</p>
         <p>2
: Rasp-shaped, no handles.
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Amphiglena</tp:taxon-name>
species have classic avicular abdominal uncini with handles that vary from short to medium in length (

Rouse &amp; 
Gambi1997
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Caobangia</tp:taxon-name>
has rasp-shaped uncini (though with a main fang, unlike 
<tp:taxon-name>Fabriciinae</tp:taxon-name>
) with no handles (

Fitzhugh 
1989
) and hence are neither acicular or avicular. 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
and 
Jasminiera
species are the only sabellids that possess acicular abdominal uncini.

<tp:taxon-name>Sabellidae</tp:taxon-name>
. In 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>

</p>
         <p>
Three abdominal segments is a condition found in many 
<tp:taxon-name>Fabriciinae</tp:taxon-name>
but a variable number of abdominal segments in normally found among 
<tp:taxon-name>Sabellinae</tp:taxon-name>
and no derived sabellins apart from 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
show such a limited number of abdominal segments.

A single shortest tree was found with a length of 
15
steps and a consistency index of 
1
. This tree is shown in 

. The monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>Caobangia</tp:taxon-name>
plus 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
was supported by several apomorphies: 
1
. A ‘teardrop’ body shape with expanded posterior end; 
2
. Living in a blind burrow in calcium carbonate; 
3
. Posterior segmentation not obvious; and 
4
. A faecal groove with two distinct ciliated bands. There were two unequivocal apomorphies supporting the monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
: 
5
. Two pairs of radioles; and 
11
. Three abdominal segments. Characters 7, 8 and 
9
were based on uncini or companion chaetae and were all multistate with different states for 
<tp:taxon-name>Caobangia</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
. There are three most parsimonious character optimisations for each of these characters and thus it is not possible to decide whether the states for either 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>Caobangia</tp:taxon-name>
for each of these characters are apomorphic for the respective genera. However, in two of the possible three transformations for each of characters 
7–9
the states are apomorphies for the respective genera and so they are marked as supporting these nodes (though marked with *). For 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
this suggests that there may be three further apomorphies: 
7
. Rasp-shaped avicular uncini in chaetigers 
7–8
; 
8
. Companion chaetae on chaetigers 
2–6
only; and 
9
. Acicular uncini in abdominal chaetigers. Within 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
,

it would appear that 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, are sister groups based on the expanded lateral teeth in thoracic uncini (

) and abdominal uncini (
10
).

The other known species 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
lives in gastropod shells, but the mechanism of inserting itself into the shell is thought to initially be a passive mechanism whereby the mollusc secretes nacreous material over the top of newly-settled juveniles. It is suggested by 

Fitzhugh &amp; Rouse (
1999
)

that because there is "some degree of burrow enlargement", there may be another method used in burrow formation, such as by chemical mediation. 
<tp:taxon-name>Terebrasabella fitzhughi</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, was extracted from burrows into a clump of spirorbin tubes, and it appears that in this case the species may be capable of 'active' burrowing. It is unfortunate that we did not have fresh specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, to examine. By the time of examination, 
14
years after their collection from samples of dead coral "reef rock", any knowledge of how they were living in the substrate was lost (i.e. if they were living inside the coral rock itself or associated with molluscs collected in the same samples). Fresh material was sought from the Outer Barrier Reef in 
1995
, but no specimens were found. However it seems valid to assume that it has a similar habitus as the other two species, i.e. it burrows into a CaCO 
3
substratum.
</p>
         <p>
Like 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
, both 
<tp:taxon-name>T. fitzhughi</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, are hermaphroditic species, shown by the presence of both spermatids and oocytes inside specimens (including the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
). The presence of juvenile/larval forms lying alongside adult worms inside their mucous sheaths, indicate that both species also brood direct-developing young. Also, branchial crowns were not observed on developing juveniles inside the mucous sheath, leading to a similar conclusion as that made for 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata
(

Fitzhugh &amp; Rouse, 
1999
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, i.e. that branchial crowns do not develop on juveniles until final settlement has occurred.
</p>
         <p>
Fitzhugh &amp; Rouse (
1999
)

stated that, for 
<tp:taxon-name>T. heterouncinata</tp:taxon-name>
, avicular uncini in the thorax are gradually replaced during juvenile-to-adult development (dorsal to ventral) by acicular uncini. They also found that “animals &lt;
0.7 mm
in length only produce avicular uncini” (

Fitzhugh &amp; Rouse (
1999
: p. 
368
)

. In contrast, the juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>T. hutchingsae</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, inside mucous sheath of adult 
holotype
(both approximately 
0.4 mm
in length) already possess acicular uncini, all of which are the “palmate” uncinus 
type
. We feel it reasonable to suggest that the smaller “palmate” uncini lying in the neurochaetal position of chaetigers 
3–5
of these juveniles must, as growth occurs, eventually be replaced by the other adult thoracic crested acicular and avicular uncini. Similarly for 
<tp:taxon-name>T. fitzhughi</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, juveniles of 
8–11
chaetigers in length possessed few avicular uncini, or none at all at an even smaller size (~ 
0.3 mm
in length). Chaetal replacement of avicular with acicular uncini does not seem to be occurring in these two species.
