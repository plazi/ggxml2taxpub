Morphological and genetic studies of specimens identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes bombyx
(

Claparède, 
1870
)
</tp:taxon-name>
revealed that the supposedly cosmopolitan species represents a species complex. Species belonging to this complex are 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx
(

Claparède, 
1870
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>S. aucklandicus</tp:taxon-name>
Meißner, 
2005
, 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi
Zachs, 
1933</tp:taxon-name>
and the newly described 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
. Morphological differences between these species are slight and concern the start of sabre chaetae, the shape of dorsal ciliated organs, and the start and number of neuropodial hooks in relation to body size. Specimens from the Atlantic Ocean examined in the course of this study also belong to this species complex but could not be assigned to any of the known species. Genetic differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
in both examined genes (
18
S, 
COI
) are significant and genetic distances are comparable to distances found between sister species in other spionid taxa. As expected, the nuclear 
18
S rRNA is generally more conserved than the mitochondrial 
COI
gene. The significance beyond taxonomy of dorsal ciliated organs and of the presence of sabre chaetae in certain body regions is briefly discussed, but conclusions about the phylogenetic relationships and character evolution within 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
must remain tentative.

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes
Grube, 
1860</tp:taxon-name>
is a well-defined genus within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Spionidae</tp:taxon-name>
. It is readily identified by the large crook-like hooks in the first neuropodia. Other important generic characters are the lack of branchiae and the division of the body into three morphologically distinct regions. A character that proved extremely valuable for the identification of 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species was recently documented by Meißner &amp; Hutchings (
2003
). This character is referred to as the “chaetal spreader” and is related to glandular organs present in all known 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species in segments of the middle body region. Of particular relevance are the openings of glandular organs on chaetigers 
5 to 8
. Five different but species-specific 
types
of openings (= chaetal spreader 
types
) have been described (Meißner &amp; Hutchings 
2003
). The discovery of this character together with the careful examination of previously described diagnostic characters enabled a major revision of the genus, which was published by Meißner (
2005
). Based on that revision, 
29
species are currently considered valid.
</p>
         <p>
However, not all problems have been solved. One of the still problematic species is the cosmopolitan 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes bombyx
(

Claparède, 
1870
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. The 
type
locality of the species is the Gulf of Naples, 
Italy
. In his description 

Claparède (
1870
)

provided detailed information on the species. For example, he mentioned important diagnostic characters like the prostomial frontal horns, the presence of glandular organs in chaetigers 
5–14
, and the first appearance of hooks in the neuropodia of chaetiger 
15
together with the sabre chaetae. An important amendment of the species diagnosis was the inclusion of a description of the openings of glandular organs in chaetigers 
5 to 8
(Meißner &amp; Hutchings 
2003
). In 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
chaetal spreaders of the “0+ 
1type
” with an undulate glandular opening are well developed in chaetigers 5, 7 and 
8
; on chaetiger 
6
the opening of the glandular organ is often reduced to a short vertical slit (Meißner &amp; Hutchings 
2003
; Meißner 
2005
). In addition, the same authors discovered the presence of quadridentate hooks with a partial hood rather than partially hooded bidentate hooks as reported before.
</p>
         <p>
The above-mentioned set of characters almost allows the reliable identification of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
, but intraspecific variation has been observed (Meißner 
2005
). Intraspecific variation concerns two characters. The first one is related to the neuropodial hooks in the posterior body region. Based on previous studies neuropodial hooks start on chaetiger 
15 in
both juvenile and adult specimens from European coastal waters. The same holds true for specimens from the western North Atlantic (off Florida and North Carolina) and for specimens from the Eastern North Pacific Ocean (off Alaska and British 
Columbia
). 

Imajima (
1991
)

also reported chaetiger 
15
to be the first hook-bearing chaetiger in specimens from 
Japan
. In specimens from off NW Africa (SE Atlantic Ocean), 
Chile
, and California (both Pacific Ocean), the first hook-bearing chaetiger was the 
15
th in adult specimens and the 
14
th in juvenile specimens.
</p>
         <p>
The second character with intraspecific variation in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
is the first appearance of stout chaetae (referred to as sabre chaetae) in the inferiormost position in the neuropodia. Often they are positioned slightly off the row of neuropodial chaetae (or hooks). As stated in the original description for 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
, sabre chaetae occur only in hook-bearing chaetigers in specimens from most of the above-mentioned localities. In specimens from California, however, they have been observed from chaetiger 
10
onwards, thus a few chaetigers before the start of the hooded hooks (Meißner 
2005
). 

Imajima (
1991
)

described the first appearance of sabre chaetae in specimens from Japanese waters as varying between chaetigers 
10 to 12
.
</p>
         <p>
These observations suggested that 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
might represent a species complex and morphological studies as well as genetic studies were undertaken. The focus of the present study was on material from California and Europe, including the 
type
locality. The aim of the study was to determine how observed morphological differences between specimens from Europe and California are related to potential genetic variation and whether the hypothesis that 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
represents a species complex is supported.

Morphology was investigated using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Methyl green staining is strongly recommended for observation of most characters by means of light microscopy. Specimens have to be transferred into water first and then dipped into a methyl green solution. The staining fades quickly when specimens are returned to alcohol. Staining with Shirlastain A is most helpful for the observation of dorsal ciliated organs under the light microscope and can be applied in either ethanol or water. Drawings were made using a camera lucida. If characters shown in the drawings are visible only after staining, it is indicated in the caption. Light micrographs were taken with a Leica EC 
3
digital camera. For SEM studies specimens were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, critical-point dried, sputter coated with carbon and examined with a Leo 
1525
scanning electron microscope. Measurements of body width refer to the distance between the distalmost points of parapodial rami on chaetiger 
4
(chaetae and postchaetal lobes disregarded) as seen from above.

Molecular analyses. Five species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
were included in the molecular analyses (

Tab.

). In addition to specimens of “ 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
” from the North Sea and California, 
<tp:taxon-name>S. kroyeri</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>S. berkeleyorum</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>S. pisinnus</tp:taxon-name>
were included. All specimens used for the genetic analyses were preserved in 
95
% ethanol. No ethanol-preserved animals of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
were available. Before 
DNA
extraction, ethanol-preserved animals were dissected and the anterior parts deposited in the first author´s personal collection for reference. From the posterior part, 
DNA
was extracted by a silica-gel-based spin column procedure (QIAmp 
DNA
Mini kit; Qiagen). A

S and

using the uncorrected p-distance and the best-fit models specified by the hierarchical likelihood ratio tests (hLRTs) in MrModeltest 
2.2
(

Nylander

). Models chosen were GTR+I+G (I = 
0.5642
; G =

) for 
COI
and SYM+G (G =

), TREEFINDER (

Jobb 
et al.2004
), and MrBayes 
3.1
.

(

Huelsenbeck &amp; Ronquist 
2001
). For phylogenetic tree reconstruction we used maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian analysis (BA). For ML and BA analysis, best-fit models and parameters as selected by the hLRT criterion were used. MP analysis was performed under the exhaustive (
18
S) and heuristic (
COI
) search option (
100
replicates) with random addition of taxa, ACCTRAN and 
TBR
branch swapping options. Equally parsimonious trees in 
COI
analysis were summarized using strict consensus. The robustness of the phylogenies obtained by MP (
18
S) and ML (
18
S and 
COI
) were tested by bootstrap analysis (

Felsenstein 
1985
) with 
1000
replications. A BA was conducted for each dataset running four chains for 
5,000,000
generations. Trees were sampled every 
100
generations and 
50
-%-majority-rule-consensus trees were computed with 
5000
trees excluded as the burn-in. For both analysed datasets, Genbank sequences of

         <p>Morphological studies</p>
         <p>
Comparative morphological examination of specimens identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
from different localities revealed the presence of three morphologically distinct groups. Morphological distinctness was based on variation concerning three characters of taxonomic importance: (
1
) the start of sabre chaetae, (
2
) the shape of dorsal ciliated organs, and (
3
) the start of neuropodial hooks in relation to body size (measured as body width on chaetiger 
4
). The first group included all specimens from both the North and Mediterranean Seas (

). A second group was formed by specimens from all along the eastern Pacific coast (

, 

– 
6
). A third group was constituted by specimens from 
Japan
(

, 

). Specimens from the North Atlantic, in particular from North Carolina and off 
Western Sahara
, could not be assigned to any of these groups (

). The number of specimens from both European waters and the eastern Pacific (groups 
1
and 
2
) examined in the course of this study was sufficiently high and included specimens of different sizes. Hence it was possible to investigate potential size-dependent variation of morphological characters. In contrast, the number of specimens from 
Japan
(group 
3
) was rather low (N = 
12
) and all specimens were of about the same size (body width on chaetiger 
4
was 
0.4–0.5 mm
). Thus, size-dependent variation could not be examined for this group. However, morphological differences between the three groups are stable, and we regard them as three different species (

).

All examined specimens from the Pacific Ocean (second and third groups) differed from the European specimens in the presence of sabre chaetae in chaetigers of the middle body region, that is, sabre chaetae were not present exclusively on hook-bearing chaetigers as was the case for specimens from the North and Mediterranean Seas (

C). In specimens from the eastern Pacific coast, sabre chaetae started on chaetiger 
10
(

B, 
6
B), rarely on chaetiger 
9
, in specimens from 
Japan
they started on either chaetiger 
9
or 
10
.
</p>
         <p>
Dorsal ciliated organs were specific for each of the three morphological groups. They differed in shape and orientation of the pairs of segmental ciliated patches usually present from posterior the dorsal ciliated crest on chaetiger 
3
(

Tab. 
2
). Differences between all groups were also observed concerning the first presence of neuropodial hooks. In the few examined specimens from 
Japan
(group 
3
), hooks always started on chaetiger 
15
. In specimens from the North and Mediterranean Seas (group 
1
), neuropodial hooks were usually present from chaetiger 
15
, but in three smaller specimens they started on chaetiger 
14
(

). In contrast, the first presence of neuropodial hooks in chaetiger 
14
was very common in specimens from the eastern Pacific coast (group 
2
) with a body width up to 
0.4 mm
(

). In larger specimens of this group neuropodial hooks were usually first observed in chaetiger 
15
.

The 
type
locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx
(

Claparède, 
1870
)
</tp:taxon-name>
is the Gulf of Naples. It is unknown whether 
types
are still extant. However, specimens examined in the scope of this study included specimens from the Gulf of Naples and a nearby area. Significant morphological differences between specimens from the 
type
locality and specimens from anywhere else in either the Mediterranean or the North Seas could not be found. Hence, all specimens from both the North and Mediterranean Seas (group 
1
) are assigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
. A revised description of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
is provided in this paper.
</p>
         <p>
Specimens from the eastern Pacific coast have been assigned to a new species, 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, which is described in detail in this paper. Specimens from 
Japan
are here assigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi
Zachs, 
1933</tp:taxon-name>
but this assignment is still uncertain and for that reason it is referred to here as 
<tp:taxon-name>S.
cf. 
uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
. After the original description by Zachs the species was never thoroughly discussed in the taxonomic literature and records other than those by Zachs himself are unknown to us. This might be explained by the insufficient original description and by the fact that 
type
material cannot be sent abroad from the collection in St. Petersburg, 
Russia
. For the present study it was possible to obtain one of the two 
syntypes
deposited in St. Petersburg via personal courier. A revised description of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
based on the examined 
syntype
is provided below (

). It turned out that 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
is very similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
, but even more similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
The body width of the examined 
type
specimen, an anterior fragment, is 
0.8 mm
. Sabre chaetae are first present in chaetiger 
10
; neuropodial hooks start on chaetiger 
15
. Unfortunately, the condition of the 
type
specimen does not allow the observation of the dorsal ciliated organs posterior to chaetiger 
2
. The beginning of both sabre chaetae and hooded hooks in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
would justify an assignment to either of two of the morphologically distinct groups established in the course of the present study, in particular to group 
3
with specimens from 
Japan
or to group 
2
, the 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
A definite assignment based on morphological characters is not possible as long as the nature of the dorsal ciliated organs posterior to chaetiger 
2
is unknown. Examination of the second 
syntype
deposited in St. Petersburg might provide new clues regarding this problem. However, the 
type
locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
is the Sea of 
Japan
, Peter the Great Bay, which is not far from 
Japan
. It seems justified to consider that specimens from 
Japan
belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
. But the examination of the second 
syntype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
and additional material from the NW Pacific is indispensable. Additional material, especially specimens of different sizes, would provide new information on the morphology of the species (including intraspecific variation of certain characters) and eventually allow the detailed description of the species occurring in this region.

            <p>Diagnosis.
Prostomium broad anteriorly; subtriangular, bell-shaped or rarely rounded; anterior margin often laterally extended, forming horns of different length; with or without occipital antenna. Eyes present or absent. Dorsal ciliated organs of different 
types
present: (
1
) starting posterior to the prostomium as two continuous ciliated bands, differing in both length and also slightly in shape but maximally extending to chaetiger 
17
; (
2
) starting posterior to the prostomium as two short ciliated bands extending to the end of chaetiger 
2
, often followed by segmental ciliated patches of different shape; (
3
) starting posterior to the prostomium as pair of dorsal loops not extending beyond chaetiger 
6
; or (
4
) as ciliated grooves/short bands posterior to the prostomium.
</p>
            <p>Peristomium moderately to well developed, forming lateral bulges or wings. Branchiae absent. Dorsal ciliated crests usually present.</p>
            <p>
Body divided into three distinct regions: (
1
) anterior region extending up to chaetiger 
4
, with parapodia 
1– 4
usually exhibiting well-developed neuro- and notopodial postchaetal lamellae compared to those of subsequent chaetigers, often positioned dorsally or dorsolaterally; (
2
) middle region extending from chaetiger 
5
to last chaetiger bearing capillary chaetae rather than hooks in neuropodia, chaetigers usually with parapodial glandular organs (see Meißner &amp; Hutchings 
2003
); (
3
) posterior region indicated by presence of neuropodial hooks. Ventrolateral intersegmental pouches present or absent between neuropodia.
</p>
            <p>
Notochaetae capillaries, often limbate or hirsute, in middle body region usually arranged in three rows. Neuropodia of chaetiger 
1
with 
1–2
conspicuous crook-like chaetae, other neurochaetae of chaetigers 
1–4
simple, hirsute or limbate capillaries arranged in two rows. From chaetiger 
5
neurochaetae short, broad, often sheathed and distally pointed; arranged in 
1–2
indistinct rows. Neuropodial hooks first present from chaetiger 
13
(in juvenile specimens of certain species), 14, 15, or 
16
; quadridentate, with main fang surmounted by single unpaired tooth and pair of smaller distal teeth, additional small teeth rarely present; reduced hood absent or present. Bacillary chaetae may be exposed from chaetigers 
5–8
. One or two ventral sabre chaetae often present from chaetiger 
4
, rarely from chaetigers 5, 9, 
10
, or 
12
, or sometimes not present until neuropodial hooks start; sabre chaetae accompanying hooks often with cryptic ridge (easy to observe under SEM). Stout, curved notochaetae often present in far posterior parapodia. Pygidium with two or more anal cirri.

followed by metameric patches in a species-specific pattern (see species description above), the exclusive presence of sabre chaetae in hook-bearing chaetigers, and the presence of partially hooded hooks in neuropodia of the posterior body region. Differences between morphologically similar species from other geographic regions most importantly concern the orientation of the dorsal ciliated patches on chaetigers of the middle and posterior body region (

Tab. 
2
), the start of neuropodial hooks on chaetiger 
15
(on chaetiger 
14
only in small juvenile specimens) as well as the restriction of sabre chaetae to hook-bearing chaetigers. In addition, the number of neuropodial hooks is lower in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>S. aucklandicus</tp:taxon-name>
if comparing specimens of same size (see Meißner

               <tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
can no longer be regarded as a species with a world-wide distribution. The distribution might be wider than reflected by the records from the North and Mediterranean Seas confirmed here, but the status of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
as a cosmopolitan species has to be dismissed.

Webster &amp; Benedict,

from Wellfleet, Massachusetts with 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
has to be verified in future studies based on the investigation of material from the 
type
locality (also see chapter Discussion in this paper). The 
type
material of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. verrilli</tp:taxon-name>
was investigated by the first author but its study did not allow final conclusions since important characters are not observable any longer. It consists of five permanent slides with several chaetigers, plus one middle and one posterior fragment.

Planktonic larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes

is easily distinguished from all other 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species known from coastal waters of the eastern Pacific by its strikingly long anterolateral horns; the chaetal spreaders of “0+ 
1type
” with an undulate to almost semicircular opening well developed on chaetigers 5, 7, and 
8
; the dorsal ciliated organs starting as two short continuous bands extending to the end of chaetiger 
2
followed by metameric patches in a species-specific pattern as described above; the first presence of sabre chaetae not earlier than chaetiger 
10
(rarely 
9
); and the presence of partially hooded hooks in the neuropodia of the posterior body region. 
<tp:taxon-name>S. anoculata</tp:taxon-name>
, a morphologically similar species, occurs in deep waters of the North Pacific Ocean, off California. 
<tp:taxon-name>S. anoculata</tp:taxon-name>
is of smaller size, sabre setae start on chaetiger 
4
, and chaetal spreaders are fully developed on chaetigers 
5–8
rather than 5, 7, and 
8
as in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
. In addition, both species exhibit speciesspecific patterns of dorsal ciliated organs (for comparison see 

Tab. 
2
).
</p>
            <p>
Differences between morphologically similar species from other geographic regions most importantly concern the orientation of the dorsal ciliated patches on chaetigers of the middle and posterior body region (

Tab. 
2
). 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
is the only known member of this species complex with oblique orientation of metameric ciliated patches from early in the middle body region (from between chaetigers 
9–10
).
</p>
            <p>
Intraspecific variation in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
includes the number of anal cirri and the shape of the opening of chaetal spreaders on chaetigers 5, 7, and 
8
. Usually two lateral anal cirri are present; however, sometimes the cirri are split into as many as three thin cirri. The presence of chaetal spreaders of “0+ 
1type
” with either an undulate or almost semicircular opening on anterior chaetigers of the middle body region seemed to depend on preservation: if bacillary fibres were exposed from inside the glandular organs or if the openings of the glandular organs were expanded, the shape of the opening tended to be more rounded (and hence described as rather semicircular than undulate).

The

material of 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes chilensis

holotype
the species was found to be a junior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes duplex
(

)
</tp:taxon-name>
by Meißner (
2005
). However, a single 
paratype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. chilensis</tp:taxon-name>
was identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes fimbriata
Moore,

whereas all other 
paratypes
were identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx
(

</tp:taxon-name>
by the same author at this time. These latter specimens were now investigated again in the course of this study and were found to belong to the newly described

            <p>Remarks.
The original description by 

Zachs (
1933
)

was as follows: 
“
Postchaetal notopodial lamellae of chaetigers 
1–8
foliaceous, later becoming rather cirriform. Dorsal pattern of double horizontal stripes on anterior segments. Dorsal crest absent on the first chaetiger. Hooks similar to those in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
. In 
10
posterior segments 
1–2
long stout notochaetae.” The 
syntype
examined in the course of this study was an anterior fragment of 
35
chaetigers. The specimen is of dark brown colour, which affected observation under the light microscope. Moreover, the specimen is very brittle and hence extensive dissection of parapodia was avoided and only a few neuropodial hooks were removed. For that reason detailed information on chaetal characters of the 
syntype
is limited. However, preliminary results from examination of specimens from 
Japan
are provided in this study. Based on those results, the differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
and other 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species are as follows:
</p>
         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="reference_group">
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
is easily distinguished from all other 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species known from coastal waters of the western Pacific by its strikingly long anterolateral horns; the chaetal spreaders of “0+ 
1type
” with an almost semicircular opening well developed on chaetigers 5, 7, and 
8
; the dorsal ciliated organs starting as two short continuous bands extending to the end of chaetiger 
2
followed by metameric patches in a species-specific pattern as described above; the first presence of sabre chaetae not earlier than chaetiger 
9
; and the presence of partially hooded hooks in the neuropodia of the posterior body region. For differences with 
<tp:taxon-name>S. anoculata</tp:taxon-name>
from deep waters of the North Pacific Ocean, off California, see remarks under 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
. Reliable identification of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
is currently possible only if based on observation of the dorsal ciliated organs (

Tab. 
2
). All other character states overlap with character variation in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
. The species description of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
has to be enhanced as soon as new material from the 
type
locality becomes available. Also, it is necessary to investigate the possible synonymy of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Japan
(see descriptions by 

Okuda 
1937
and 

Imajima 
1991
) with 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
.

            <p>Diagnosis.
Prostomium broad anteriorly; subtriangular, bell-shaped or rarely rounded; anterior margin often laterally extended, forming horns of different length; with or without occipital antenna. Eyes present or absent. Dorsal ciliated organs of different 
types
present: (
1
) starting posterior to the prostomium as two continuous ciliated bands, differing in both length and also slightly in shape but maximally extending to chaetiger 
17
; (
2
) starting posterior to the prostomium as two short ciliated bands extending to the end of chaetiger 
2
, often followed by segmental ciliated patches of different shape; (
3
) starting posterior to the prostomium as pair of dorsal loops not extending beyond chaetiger 
6
; or (
4
) as ciliated grooves/short bands posterior to the prostomium.
</p>
            <p>Peristomium moderately to well developed, forming lateral bulges or wings. Branchiae absent. Dorsal ciliated crests usually present.</p>
            <p>
Body divided into three distinct regions: (
1
) anterior region extending up to chaetiger 
4
, with parapodia 
1– 4
usually exhibiting well-developed neuro- and notopodial postchaetal lamellae compared to those of subsequent chaetigers, often positioned dorsally or dorsolaterally; (
2
) middle region extending from chaetiger 
5
to last chaetiger bearing capillary chaetae rather than hooks in neuropodia, chaetigers usually with parapodial glandular organs (see Meißner &amp; Hutchings 
2003
); (
3
) posterior region indicated by presence of neuropodial hooks. Ventrolateral intersegmental pouches present or absent between neuropodia.
</p>
            <p>
Notochaetae capillaries, often limbate or hirsute, in middle body region usually arranged in three rows. Neuropodia of chaetiger 
1
with 
1–2
conspicuous crook-like chaetae, other neurochaetae of chaetigers 
1–4
simple, hirsute or limbate capillaries arranged in two rows. From chaetiger 
5
neurochaetae short, broad, often sheathed and distally pointed; arranged in 
1–2
indistinct rows. Neuropodial hooks first present from chaetiger 
13
(in juvenile specimens of certain species), 14, 15, or 
16
; quadridentate, with main fang surmounted by single unpaired tooth and pair of smaller distal teeth, additional small teeth rarely present; reduced hood absent or present. Bacillary chaetae may be exposed from chaetigers 
5–8
. One or two ventral sabre chaetae often present from chaetiger 
4
, rarely from chaetigers 5, 9, 
10
, or 
12
, or sometimes not present until neuropodial hooks start; sabre chaetae accompanying hooks often with cryptic ridge (easy to observe under SEM). Stout, curved notochaetae often present in far posterior parapodia. Pygidium with two or more anal cirri.

is of smaller size, sabre setae start on chaetiger 
4
, and chaetal spreaders are fully developed on chaetigers 
5–8
rather than 5, 7, and 
8
as in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
. In addition, both species exhibit speciesspecific patterns of dorsal ciliated organs (for comparison see 

Tab. 
2
).
</p>
            <p>
Differences between morphologically similar species from other geographic regions most importantly concern the orientation of the dorsal ciliated patches on chaetigers of the middle and posterior body region (

Tab. 
2
). 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
is the only known member of this species complex with oblique orientation of metameric ciliated patches from early in the middle body region (from between chaetigers 
9–10
).
</p>
            <p>
Intraspecific variation in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
includes the number of anal cirri and the shape of the opening of chaetal spreaders on chaetigers 5, 7, and 
8
. Usually two lateral anal cirri are present; however, sometimes the cirri are split into as many as three thin cirri. The presence of chaetal spreaders of “0+ 
1type
” with either an undulate or almost semicircular opening on anterior chaetigers of the middle body region seemed to depend on preservation: if bacillary fibres were exposed from inside the glandular organs or if the openings of the glandular organs were expanded, the shape of the opening tended to be more rounded (and hence described as rather semicircular than undulate).

material of 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes chilensis
Hartmann-Schröder,

consisted of a 
holotype
and several

. Based on the 
holotype
the species was found to be a junior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes duplex
(

Chamberlin,

</tp:taxon-name>
by Meißner (
2005

of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. chilensis</tp:taxon-name>
was identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes fimbriata
Moore,

whereas all other 
paratypes
were identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx
(

            <p>Remarks.
The original description by 

Zachs (
1933
)

was as follows: 
“
Postchaetal notopodial lamellae of chaetigers 
1–8
foliaceous, later becoming rather cirriform. Dorsal pattern of double horizontal stripes on anterior segments. Dorsal crest absent on the first chaetiger. Hooks similar to those in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
. In 
10
posterior segments 
1–2
long stout notochaetae.” The 
syntype
examined in the course of this study was an anterior fragment of 
35
chaetigers. The specimen is of dark brown colour, which affected observation under the light microscope. Moreover, the specimen is very brittle and hence extensive dissection of parapodia was avoided and only a few neuropodial hooks were removed. For that reason detailed information on chaetal characters of the 
syntype
is limited. However, preliminary results from examination of specimens from 
Japan
are provided in this study. Based on those results, the differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
and other 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species are as follows:
</p>
         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="reference_group">
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
is easily distinguished from all other 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species known from coastal waters of the western Pacific by its strikingly long anterolateral horns; the chaetal spreaders of “0+ 
1type
” with an almost semicircular opening well developed on chaetigers 5, 7, and 
8
; the dorsal ciliated organs starting as two short continuous bands extending to the end of chaetiger 
2
followed by metameric patches in a species-specific pattern as described above; the first presence of sabre chaetae not earlier than chaetiger 
9
; and the presence of partially hooded hooks in the neuropodia of the posterior body region. For differences with 
<tp:taxon-name>S. anoculata</tp:taxon-name>
from deep waters of the North Pacific Ocean, off California, see remarks under 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
. Reliable identification of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
is currently possible only if based on observation of the dorsal ciliated organs (

Tab. 
2
). All other character states overlap with character variation in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
. The species description of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
has to be enhanced as soon as new material from the 
type
locality becomes available. Also, it is necessary to investigate the possible synonymy of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Japan
(see descriptions by 

Okuda 
1937
and 

Imajima 
1991
) with 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
.

            <p>Diagnosis.
Prostomium broad anteriorly; subtriangular, bell-shaped or rarely rounded; anterior margin often laterally extended, forming horns of different length; with or without occipital antenna. Eyes present or absent. Dorsal ciliated organs of different 
types
present: (
1
) starting posterior to the prostomium as two continuous ciliated bands, differing in both length and also slightly in shape but maximally extending to chaetiger 
17
; (
2
) starting posterior to the prostomium as two short ciliated bands extending to the end of chaetiger 
2
, often followed by segmental ciliated patches of different shape; (
3
) starting posterior to the prostomium as pair of dorsal loops not extending beyond chaetiger 
6
; or (
4
) as ciliated grooves/short bands posterior to the prostomium.
</p>
            <p>Peristomium moderately to well developed, forming lateral bulges or wings. Branchiae absent. Dorsal ciliated crests usually present.</p>
            <p>
Body divided into three distinct regions: (
1
) anterior region extending up to chaetiger 
4
, with parapodia 
1– 4
usually exhibiting well-developed neuro- and notopodial postchaetal lamellae compared to those of subsequent chaetigers, often positioned dorsally or dorsolaterally; (
2
) middle region extending from chaetiger 
5
to last chaetiger bearing capillary chaetae rather than hooks in neuropodia, chaetigers usually with parapodial glandular organs (see Meißner &amp; Hutchings 
2003
); (
3
) posterior region indicated by presence of neuropodial hooks. Ventrolateral intersegmental pouches present or absent between neuropodia.
</p>
            <p>
Notochaetae capillaries, often limbate or hirsute, in middle body region usually arranged in three rows. Neuropodia of chaetiger 
1
with 
1–2
conspicuous crook-like chaetae, other neurochaetae of chaetigers 
1–4
simple, hirsute or limbate capillaries arranged in two rows. From chaetiger 
5
neurochaetae short, broad, often sheathed and distally pointed; arranged in 
1–2
indistinct rows. Neuropodial hooks first present from chaetiger 
13
(in juvenile specimens of certain species), 14, 15, or 
16
; quadridentate, with main fang surmounted by single unpaired tooth and pair of smaller distal teeth, additional small teeth rarely present; reduced hood absent or present. Bacillary chaetae may be exposed from chaetigers 
5–8
. One or two ventral sabre chaetae often present from chaetiger 
4
, rarely from chaetigers 5, 9, 
10
, or 
12
, or sometimes not present until neuropodial hooks start; sabre chaetae accompanying hooks often with cryptic ridge (easy to observe under SEM). Stout, curved notochaetae often present in far posterior parapodia. Pygidium with two or more anal cirri.

species in the North and Mediterranean Seas by its strikingly long anterolateral horns, the chaetal spreaders of the “0+

8
, the dorsal ciliated organs starting as two short continuous bands extending to the end of chaetiger 
2
followed by metameric patches in a species-specific pattern (see species description above), the exclusive presence of sabre chaetae in hook-bearing chaetigers, and the presence of partially hooded hooks in neuropodia of the posterior body region. Differences between morphologically similar species from other geographic regions most importantly concern the orientation of the dorsal ciliated patches on chaetigers of the middle and posterior body region (

Tab. 
2
), the start of neuropodial hooks on chaetiger 
15
(on chaetiger 
14
only in small juvenile specimens) as well as the restriction of sabre chaetae to hook-bearing chaetigers. In addition, the number of neuropodial hooks is lower in

compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>S. aucklandicus</tp:taxon-name>
if comparing specimens of same size (see Meißner

               <tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>

Webster &amp; Benedict,

from Wellfleet, Massachusetts with 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
has to be verified in future studies based on the investigation of material from the 
type
locality (also see chapter Discussion in this paper). The 
type
material of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. verrilli</tp:taxon-name>
was investigated by the first author but its study did not allow final conclusions since important characters are not observable any longer. It consists of five permanent slides with several chaetigers, plus one middle and one posterior fragment.

Planktonic larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes
cf.

were found in Tomales Bay, California in November (

Blake

is easily distinguished from all other 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species known from coastal waters of the eastern Pacific by its strikingly long anterolateral horns; the chaetal spreaders of “0+ 
1type
” with an undulate to almost semicircular opening well developed on chaetigers 5, 7, and 
8
; the dorsal ciliated organs starting as two short continuous bands extending to the end of chaetiger 
2
followed by metameric patches in a species-specific pattern as described above; the first presence of sabre chaetae not earlier than chaetiger 
10
(rarely 
9
); and the presence of partially hooded hooks in the neuropodia of the posterior body region. 
<tp:taxon-name>S. anoculata</tp:taxon-name>
, a morphologically similar species, occurs in deep waters of the North Pacific Ocean, off California. 
<tp:taxon-name>S. anoculata</tp:taxon-name>
is of smaller size, sabre setae start on chaetiger 
4
, and chaetal spreaders are fully developed on chaetigers 
5–8
rather than 5, 7, and 
8
as in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
. In addition, both species exhibit speciesspecific patterns of dorsal ciliated organs (for comparison see 

Tab. 
2
).
</p>
            <p>
Differences between morphologically similar species from other geographic regions most importantly concern the orientation of the dorsal ciliated patches on chaetigers of the middle and posterior body region (

Tab. 
2
). 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
is the only known member of this species complex with oblique orientation of metameric ciliated patches from early in the middle body region (from between chaetigers 
9–10
).
</p>
            <p>
Intraspecific variation in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
includes the number of anal cirri and the shape of the opening of chaetal spreaders on chaetigers 5, 7, and 
8
. Usually two lateral anal cirri are present; however, sometimes the cirri are split into as many as three thin cirri. The presence of chaetal spreaders of “0+ 
1type
” with either an undulate or almost semicircular opening on anterior chaetigers of the middle body region seemed to depend on preservation: if bacillary fibres were exposed from inside the glandular organs or if the openings of the glandular organs were expanded, the shape of the opening tended to be more rounded (and hence described as rather semicircular than undulate).

The 
type
material of 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes chilensis
Hartmann-Schröder,

consisted of a 
holotype
and several 
paratypes
. Based on the 
holotype
the species was found to be a junior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes duplex
(

Chamberlin, 
1919
)
</tp:taxon-name>
by Meißner (
2005

of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. chilensis</tp:taxon-name>
was identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes fimbriata
Moore, 
1923</tp:taxon-name>
whereas all other 
paratypes
were identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx
(

            <p>Remarks.
The original description by 

Zachs (
1933
)

was as follows: 
“
Postchaetal notopodial lamellae of chaetigers 
1–8
foliaceous, later becoming rather cirriform. Dorsal pattern of double horizontal stripes on anterior segments. Dorsal crest absent on the first chaetiger. Hooks similar to those in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
. In 
10
posterior segments 
1–2
long stout notochaetae.” The 
syntype
examined in the course of this study was an anterior fragment of 
35
chaetigers. The specimen is of dark brown colour, which affected observation under the light microscope. Moreover, the specimen is very brittle and hence extensive dissection of parapodia was avoided and only a few neuropodial hooks were removed. For that reason detailed information on chaetal characters of the 
syntype
is limited. However, preliminary results from examination of specimens from 
Japan
are provided in this study. Based on those results, the differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
and other 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species are as follows:

            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
is easily distinguished from all other 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species known from coastal waters of the western Pacific by its strikingly long anterolateral horns; the chaetal spreaders of “0+ 
1type
” with an almost semicircular opening well developed on chaetigers 5, 7, and 
8
; the dorsal ciliated organs starting as two short continuous bands extending to the end of chaetiger 
2
followed by metameric patches in a species-specific pattern as described above; the first presence of sabre chaetae not earlier than chaetiger 
9
; and the presence of partially hooded hooks in the neuropodia of the posterior body region. For differences with 
<tp:taxon-name>S. anoculata</tp:taxon-name>
from deep waters of the North Pacific Ocean, off California, see remarks under 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
. Reliable identification of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
is currently possible only if based on observation of the dorsal ciliated organs (

Tab. 
2
). All other character states overlap with character variation in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
. The species description of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
has to be enhanced as soon as new material from the 
type
locality becomes available. Also, it is necessary to investigate the possible synonymy of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Japan
(see descriptions by 

Okuda 
1937

            <p>Diagnosis.
Prostomium broad anteriorly; subtriangular, bell-shaped or rarely rounded; anterior margin often laterally extended, forming horns of different length; with or without occipital antenna. Eyes present or absent. Dorsal ciliated organs of different 
types
present: (
1
) starting posterior to the prostomium as two continuous ciliated bands, differing in both length and also slightly in shape but maximally extending to chaetiger 
17
; (
2
) starting posterior to the prostomium as two short ciliated bands extending to the end of chaetiger 
2
, often followed by segmental ciliated patches of different shape; (
3
) starting posterior to the prostomium as pair of dorsal loops not extending beyond chaetiger 
6
; or (
4
) as ciliated grooves/short bands posterior to the prostomium.
</p>
            <p>Peristomium moderately to well developed, forming lateral bulges or wings. Branchiae absent. Dorsal ciliated crests usually present.</p>
            <p>
Body divided into three distinct regions: (
1
) anterior region extending up to chaetiger 
4
, with parapodia 
1– 4
usually exhibiting well-developed neuro- and notopodial postchaetal lamellae compared to those of subsequent chaetigers, often positioned dorsally or dorsolaterally; (
2
) middle region extending from chaetiger 
5
to last chaetiger bearing capillary chaetae rather than hooks in neuropodia, chaetigers usually with parapodial glandular organs (see Meißner &amp; Hutchings 
2003

followed by metameric patches in a species-specific pattern (see species description above), the exclusive presence of sabre chaetae in hook-bearing chaetigers, and the presence of partially hooded hooks in neuropodia of the posterior body region. Differences between morphologically similar species from other geographic regions most importantly concern the orientation of the dorsal ciliated patches on chaetigers of the middle and posterior body region (

Tab.

Planktonic larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes
cf.

were found in Tomales Bay, California in November (

Blake

is easily distinguished from all other 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species known from coastal waters of the eastern Pacific by its strikingly long anterolateral horns; the chaetal spreaders of “0+ 
1type
” with an undulate to almost semicircular opening well developed on chaetigers 5, 7, and 
8
; the dorsal ciliated organs starting as two short continuous bands extending to the end of chaetiger 
2
followed by metameric patches in a species-specific pattern as described above; the first presence of sabre chaetae not earlier than chaetiger 
10
(rarely 
9
); and the presence of partially hooded hooks in the neuropodia of the posterior body region. 
<tp:taxon-name>S. anoculata</tp:taxon-name>
, a morphologically similar species, occurs in deep waters of the North Pacific Ocean, off California. 
<tp:taxon-name>S. anoculata</tp:taxon-name>
is of smaller size, sabre setae start on chaetiger 
4
, and chaetal spreaders are fully developed on chaetigers 
5–8
rather than 5, 7, and 
8
as in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
. In addition, both species exhibit speciesspecific patterns of dorsal ciliated organs (for comparison see 

Tab. 
2
).
</p>
            <p>
Differences between morphologically similar species from other geographic regions most importantly concern the orientation of the dorsal ciliated patches on chaetigers of the middle and posterior body region (

Tab. 
2
). 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
is the only known member of this species complex with oblique orientation of metameric ciliated patches from early in the middle body region (from between chaetigers 
9–10
).
</p>
            <p>
Intraspecific variation in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
includes the number of anal cirri and the shape of the opening of chaetal spreaders on chaetigers 5, 7, and 
8
. Usually two lateral anal cirri are present; however, sometimes the cirri are split into as many as three thin cirri. The presence of chaetal spreaders of “0+ 
1type
” with either an undulate or almost semicircular opening on anterior chaetigers of the middle body region seemed to depend on preservation: if bacillary fibres were exposed from inside the glandular organs or if the openings of the glandular organs were expanded, the shape of the opening tended to be more rounded (and hence described as rather semicircular than undulate).

</tp:taxon-name>
by Meißner (

            <p>Remarks.
The original description by 

Zachs (
1933
)

was as follows: 
“
Postchaetal notopodial lamellae of chaetigers 
1–8
foliaceous, later becoming rather cirriform. Dorsal pattern of double horizontal stripes on anterior segments. Dorsal crest absent on the first chaetiger. Hooks similar to those in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
. In 
10
posterior segments 
1–2
long stout notochaetae.” The 
syntype
examined in the course of this study was an anterior fragment of 
35
chaetigers. The specimen is of dark brown colour, which affected observation under the light microscope. Moreover, the specimen is very brittle and hence extensive dissection of parapodia was avoided and only a few neuropodial hooks were removed. For that reason detailed information on chaetal characters of the 
syntype
is limited. However, preliminary results from examination of specimens from 
Japan
are provided in this study. Based on those results, the differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
and other 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species are as follows:

            <p>

is easily distinguished from all other 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species known from coastal waters of the western Pacific by its strikingly long anterolateral horns; the chaetal spreaders of “0+ 
1type
” with an almost semicircular opening well developed on chaetigers 5, 7, and 
8
; the dorsal ciliated organs starting as two short continuous bands extending to the end of chaetiger 
2
followed by metameric patches in a species-specific pattern as described above; the first presence of sabre chaetae not earlier than chaetiger 
9
; and the presence of partially hooded hooks in the neuropodia of the posterior body region. For differences with 
<tp:taxon-name>S. anoculata</tp:taxon-name>

To assess the genetic divergence between “

” from the North Sea and California, we sequenced portions of the mitochondrial 
COI
gene and the nuclear 
18
S gene. No ethanol-fixed samples of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. uschakowi</tp:taxon-name>
were available. Specimens of the more distantly related taxa

). Only 
<tp:taxon-name>S. kroyeri</tp:taxon-name>
showed low variation of 
0.1

(

). They share several morphological characters separating them from all other known 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species. Such characters include long anterolateral prostomial horns, the development of parapodial glands with well-developed chaetal spreaders of the “0+ 
1type
” with an undulate or almost semicircular opening on chaetigers 5, 7, and 
8
, and dorsal ciliated organs that start as short continuous bands posterior to the prostomium and are followed by a species-specific pattern of metameric ciliated patches (Tab. 
4
). Species of this complex possess partially hooded abdominal neuropodial hooks, and intersegmental lateral pouches are absent. In addition, the late start of sabre chaetae in either posterior chaetigers of the middle body region or in chaetigers of the posterior body region is a striking difference compared to all other 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
species (except 
<tp:taxon-name>S. wigleyi</tp:taxon-name>
) (Tab.

</p>
         <p>
Specimens from the Atlantic Ocean (off North Carolina and 
Western Sahara
) examined in the course of this study certainly also belong to this species complex but could not be assigned to any of the known species. In this connection it also has to be mentioned that 

Webster &amp; Benedict (
1884
)

described 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes verrilli</tp:taxon-name>
from Wellfleet, Massachusetts, in the north Atlantic Ocean. After its description 
<tp:taxon-name>S. verrilli</tp:taxon-name>
was soon synonymised with 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
by 

Mesnil (
1897
)

, and this synonymy has never been questioned. With the new results from the present study the situation has changed and verification of this synonymy is strongly required. The attempt might be hampered by the fact that the 
type
material is not in best condition and consists of several mounted fragments (see Remarks under 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
).
</p>
         <p>
Morphological differences among species of the “ 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
complex” are slight and the availability of nicely preserved specimens is essential for reliable identification. In addition, a correlation of character variation with specimen size was found for some species, e.g., the start of neuropodial hooks, and hence examination of specimens of different sizes is necessary for a comprehensive species description.
</p>
         <p>
One important conclusion can be drawn from recent taxonomic studies on 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
: the dorsal ciliated organs are of major relevance for species identification (Meißner &amp; Hutchings 
2003
; Meißner 
2005
). As explained in the genus description, four general 
types
of dorsal ciliated organs can be distinguished but species-specific modifications occur. It seems that dorsal ciliated organs are hardly ever identical in two species. If it were possible to observe them sufficiently on a regular basis they could be used as the most important diagnostic character for species identification. However, the assignment of species-specific dorsal ciliated organs to the four defined 
types
is usually straightforward. Ciliated structures incorporated into this classification are the anterior continuous ciliated bands and the metameric ciliated patches (the dorsal ciliated crests and additional thin transverse bands are not considered). From ultrastructural studies of dorsal ciliated

Spionidae, 
Jelsing</tp:taxon-name>
(2002, 
2003
) concluded that all paired dorsal ciliated structures should be referred to as nuchal organs and metameric nuchal organs, and that these structures are homologous. The homology implies the significance of dorsal ciliated organs beyond taxonomy, and the distribution of the different 
types
of dorsal ciliated organs may reflect phylogenetic relationships. Within 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
the 
type
of dorsal ciliated organs with long ciliated bands is most widespread (Tab. 
4
). The two 
types
with short ciliated bands posterior to the prostomium (either followed by metameric organs or not) are almost always restricted to the “ 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
complex” (the only exception is 
<tp:taxon-name>S. anoculata</tp:taxon-name>
). The so-called double loops (perhaps to be considered long ciliated bands forming loops?) are rarest. Looking from that perspective at the results of the analysis of our sequence data, the following situation is encountered: species having long dorsal ciliated organs (
<tp:taxon-name>S. berkeleyorum</tp:taxon-name>
and the haplotypes of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. kroyeri</tp:taxon-name>
) form a well-supported clade in the phylogenies of the 
18
S and the BA tree of the 
COI
(

). The position of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. pisinnus</tp:taxon-name>
with its double-loop dorsal ciliated organs is not clear and varies with the phylogenetic method applied. 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
,

both exhibiting dorsal ciliated organs as short continuous bands followed by metameric ciliated patches, are placed as a sister clade in the molecular phylogenies. In addition, it can be stressed that the two major clades exclusively contain either species with sabre chaetae present from chaetiger 
4
(
<tp:taxon-name>S. pisinnus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>S. berkeleyorum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>S. kroyeri</tp:taxon-name>
)

or species in which sabre chaetae appear first either in the hook-bearing chaetigers or in posterior chaetigers of the middle body region (
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
) (Tab. 
4
). However, due to the limited availability of sequence data for our genetic analysis, conclusions about the phylogenetic relationships within 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
are only preliminary and the basis for discussion of character evolution in this context is weak.

The main purpose in including molecular methods into this study was to get clues for the interpretation of morphological variation found in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
. Differences between 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
in both examined genes were significant. As expected, the nuclear 
18
S rRNA was generally more conserved than the mitochondrial 
COI
gene. The genetic distances between 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>S. norrisi</tp:taxon-name>
at the

(
16

Tab.

18

<tp:taxon-name>Marenzelleria</tp:taxon-name>
sibling species showed divergences ranging from 
11.7
% to 
21.7
% at the

0.1

Mahon

15.5
% to 
22.5
% (
COI
, uncorrected distance) between congeneric species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Streblospio</tp:taxon-name>
. The intraspecific differentiation found in the course of our study between the two clades of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. kroyeri</tp:taxon-name>
, which is evident in both analysed genes, indicates cryptic differentiation and needs to be verified by morphological as well as further molecular investigations.
</p>
         <p>
The present study is a good example that molecular techniques complement morphological studies very well. The thorough review of morphological characters and the addition of molecular data revealed cryptic speciation in the formerly cosmopolitan 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombyx</tp:taxon-name>
and the study should be considered as a starting point for future investigations of this species complex. Open questions presently most of all concern the identity of specimens from the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, a molecular and taxonomic examination of additional species will help to unravel the presently unknown phylogenetic relationships within 
<tp:taxon-name>Spiophanes</tp:taxon-name>
