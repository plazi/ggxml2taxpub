Molecular approaches have greatly advanced our understanding of species diversity and biogeography in the cladoceran crustaceans. Here, we provide the first large-scale examination of taxonomic diversity in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium
Zaddach, 
1855</tp:taxon-name>
, by characterizing patterns of allozyme, mtDNA, and morphological variation from a total of 
193
sites from three continents, including collections from near the 
type
localities for the two generally recognized species, 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium gibberum
Zaddach, 
1855</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium amazonicum
Stingelin, 
1904</tp:taxon-name>
. Allozyme data were only available for North American samples but revealed the presence of four species. Divergence patterns in the mitochondrial cytochrome 
c
oxidase subunit I (
COI
) gene supported those species, as well as a fifth taxon endemic to South 
America
. The five putative species are separated by substantial sequence (
8.7–24.5
%) and allozyme (
0.36–1.54
Nei’s distance) divergences, while intraspecific genetic diversity was generally limited in comparison. Although two of these species exhibited little morphological differentiation from their closest relatives, and diagnostic traits were not found among the characters considered, a population-level approach revealed significant morphological differences among all pairs of taxa. We therefore present both an allozyme key and a morphological/geographic key to all species, as well as new or augmented descriptions for all five species. 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
is distributed in Europe and across arctic North

            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
, is widely distributed across temperate North

. 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
is apparently restricted to the Amazon basin, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
occurs in lakes along the eastern margin of North

            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
occurs sporadically across North 
America
along a narrow band of middle latitudes. Due to high morphological variability within species, as well as the detection of cryptic diversity, we suggest that genetic analyses should be performed on populations from other geographic regions and should always accompany the recognition of new species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>
The past twenty years have seen a paradigm shift in taxonomic perceptions for the cladoceran crustaceans and many other freshwater invertebrate groups. The traditional view of low species diversity and cosmopolitan distributions was derived from the observations of early workers who noted that many freshwater invertebrates exhibited little morphological variation over vast geographic distances (

Lyell 
1832
; 

Darwin 
1859
), as well as great dispersal ability (

Darwin 
1882
). 

Mayr (
1963
)

described this biogeographic pattern as arising from the homogenizing effects of gene flow, and, indeed, the resting eggs of these organisms do possess several characteristics that would appear to make them ideal passive agents of dispersal (

Fryer 
1996
). Capable of being transported by wind and surviving passage through avian digestive systems (reviewed in 

De Meester 
et al.2002
), resting eggs also often possess sticky spines or protuberances that facilitate attachment to waterfowl, and they are produced in the greatest numbers when waterfowl migration is at its peak (

Fryer 
1996
). Propensity for dispersal is also supported by the rapid colonization of northern habitats following deglaciation for many cladocerans.
</p>
         <p>
However, despite this capacity for dispersal, detailed morphological and genetic investigations have revealed high levels of taxonomic diversity and endemicity (e.g. 
Frey 1982
, 
1985
, 
1987
; DeMelo &amp; 

Hebert 
1994
; 

Taylor 
et al.
1996

, 
1998
; 

Colbourne 
et al.1998
; 

Petrusek 
et al.2004
). Moreover, genetic information has challenged the view that gene flow is sufficient to maintain genetic cohesion among cladoceran populations on a continental — let alone a global — scale (

Boileau 
et al.1992
; Hebert &amp; Taylor 
1997
). Founder effects, combined with rapid population increase and local adaptation, may be important factors that restrict gene flow in the face of dispersal of propagules (

Boileau 
et al.1992
; 

De Meester 
et al.2002
). Thus, local genetic differentiation and continental or regional endemism, as opposed to cosmopolitanism, have become established features of our understanding of cladoceran diversity.
</p>
         <p>
Despite the high biotic and abiotic variability among aquatic habitats, such genetic divergence is often not associated with morphological change in zooplankton species. Detailed phylogenetic frameworks have allowed researchers to address key questions regarding how molecular and morphological evolution proceeds in these lineages (e.g. 

King &amp; Hanner 
1998
). For example, is morphological similarity among species due to convergence, cosmopolitanism, introgression, or shared ancestry (

Taylor 
et al.1996
)? Habitat-linked convergence and introgression have played important roles in morphological evolution in the cladocerans (

Colbourne 
et al.1997
; 

Schwenk 
et al.2000
) and these processes have tended to be associated with cases of more rapid morphological evolution. However, the overwhelming answer in most cases has been that shared ancestry, combined with a slow pace of morphological evolution, is the culprit for past cases of diversity underestimation. Thus, combined genetic and morphological approaches have proven both necessary and fruitful for assessing species diversity and for investigating the evolutionary history of the Cladocera.
</p>
         <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium
Zaddach, 
1855</tp:taxon-name>
is an example of a cladoceran taxon still regarded as being both broadly distributed and species poor. Its representatives are widely distributed in softwater lakes throughout the northern hemisphere, and also in the Amazon River basin (reviewed in 

Rowe 
2000
). Until recently, only two species were generally recognized, 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium gibberum
Zaddach, 
1855</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium amazonicum
Stingelin, 
1904</tp:taxon-name>
. Described from a pond in the region of Kaliningrad, 
Russia
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
is thought to have a broad distribution in Eurasia and North 
America
, from the high arctic to temperate latitudes, while 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
is thought to inhabit lakes in the Amazon River basin and along the Atlantic coast of North 
America
. Although 

Rao 
et al.
(
1998
)

described a new species (
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium ramasarmii</tp:taxon-name>
) from 
India
, its status is 
incertae sedis
(corroborated by 

Korovchinsky 
2004
), due to an incomplete description based upon an unspecified “body shape” and “head structure.” 

Korovchinsky (
2005
)

recently described another species from 
Greenland
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium groenlandicum</tp:taxon-name>
. Genetic analysis will be required to ascertain if these are in fact distinct species or if they are synonymous with described taxa.
</p>
         <p>
The taxonomy of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
has long been in flux. Populations exhibiting morphological anomalies and intermediate features were reported following descriptions of the original species (

Scheffelt 
1909
; 

Carpenter 
1931
; 

Coker 
1938
; 

Bunting 
1970
; 

Hegyi 
1973
). Such inconsistencies have prompted some workers to call for the recognition of just a single phenotypically plastic taxon (

Hegyi 
1973
; Havel in 

Dodson &amp; Frey 
1991
). Early studies on 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
were restricted to small geographical areas and provided little opportunity for a critical examination of taxonomic diversity. Upon examining morphological and ecological diversity in 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
from several continents, 

Hegyi (
1973
)

concluded that there was insufficient variation to warrant the recognition of two species. A decade later, however, he and others described an additional characteristic, microsculpturing on the jelly coat, which permitted reliable differentiation of the two thendescribed species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium
(

Montvilo 
et al.1987
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. 

Tessier (
1986
)

suspected the presence of different species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
in his samples, but noted that some individuals had morphological affinities to two different species. More recently, 

Korovchinsky (
1992
and 
2004
) provided summaries of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
taxonomy but no new diagnostic characters were presented. He did note a few specimens from eastern North 
America
with abnormal morphologies. 

Thier (
1994
)

was the first to carry out population genetic analyses on 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
, examining assemblages from New 
England
. Populations showed marked heterozygote deficits, which he attributed to low levels of gene flow and sporadic sexual recruitment within a single species. However, such extreme deficits are unlikely within single habitats in cyclic parthenogens like 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
, which reproduce sexually approximately yearly. 

Hebert &amp; Finston (
1997
)

later showed that the Hardy-Weinberg disturbances reflected the occurrence of at least two species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
in eastern North 
America
.
</p>
         <p>
Because of the reported existence of intermediate forms, and the uncertain taxonomy due to the limited geographical scope of past studies, this study seeks to resolve species boundaries in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
by analyzing material from across North 
America
and from a few sites in Europe and in the Amazon basin. Following allozyme and mitochondrial 
DNA
analyses aimed at diagnosing putative species boundaries, morphological analysis of select characters is carried out to assess whether there are significant differences among species and to search for diagnostic traits. We next present new and revised descriptions for five species, along with identification keys. We conclude by returning to the issue of patterns of cladoceran diversification and by suggesting avenues for further research.

         <p>Sample collection</p>
         <p>
Samples of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
were collected from 
193
localities mainly in the summers (May-September) of 
1990–1998
, including sites in all eleven North American freshwater biogeographic provinces (

Burr &amp; Mayden 
1992
) where this genus has been reported (

; and see 

Rowe 
2000
). An attempt was made to sample from the 
type
localities of the two initially described species, but logistical difficulties made this impossible. Samples from the other continents were therefore obtained from sites as close to the 
type
localities as possible. The three European sites range from approximately 
600 to 1,050 km
from the 
type
locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
(which is near Kaliningrad). Amazonian samples were obtained from about 
1,300 km
from the 
type
locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
. Nevertheless, it is assumed here that these habitats have a higher probability than the North American sites of containing the species that were originally described.

Maps of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
populations sampled for genetic analyses. Exact geographic coordinates and habitat names are provided in Appendix A. Populations sampled from outside North America are shown on the inset global map. Type localities for the two initially described species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
are indicated with stars on the inset map and were not included in this study, although (relatively) nearby collections were available. North American freshwater biogeographic provinces (after Burr &amp; Mayden 1992) are shown, and the names of those from which samples were collected are listed in the legend.
</p>
         <p>
Populations are identified by their official name or by habitat number in a particular sampling region. Each name is followed by a two-letter provincial or state abbreviation if in 
Canada
or the 
United States
; otherwise it is followed by a three-letter international country code (e.g., Inuvik 
5
NT refers to a particular waterbody in the proximity of Inuvik, Northwest Territories, 
Canada
). Most localities were sampled only once, except for Paint ON, Prospect ON, Lac La Ronge SK, and Rest WI, which were sampled in both 
1993
and 
1997
. Samples from these sites are identified with two additional digits indicating the year in which the collection occurred. Abbreviation codes, geographical coordinates, and sampling dates for all habitats are listed in Appendix A.
</p>
         <p>
All specimens were identified according to 

Pennak (
1989
)

and 

Korovchinsky (
1992
)

, and individuals were removed and stored in liquid nitrogen for genetic analyses or in 
70
% ethanol for morphological analyses. The three European populations and one Brazilian population were preserved in ethanol only, allowing mtDNA analysis but precluding allozyme analyses. Thirteen additional populations from 
Brazil
were stored in formalin, thus allowing only for morphological characterization.
</p>
         <p>Allozyme analysis</p>
         <p>Electrophoresis.
One hundred and sixty-four collections were available for allozyme analyses (see Appendix A), including the four habitats that were sampled twice in different years. Individuals were thawed and their jelly coat removed before being separately homogenized in 
4–8
ΜL of sterile distilled water. A mean of 
24
individuals (ranging from 
1–133
depending upon availability) was analyzed from each site. Allozyme variation was examined using cellulose acetate electrophoresis with a Tris-glycine buffer (pH 
8.5
), using standard methods (

Hebert &amp; Beaton 
1993
) and an electrophoretic run time of 
15
min.
</p>
         <p>
Preliminary screening of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
populations resulted in the identification of seven allozyme loci that both stained reliably and exhibited polymorphism. Thus, variation was examined at the following loci, with the abbreviations and Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers provided in parentheses: amino aspartate transferase, supernatant form (
sAat
, EC 2.6.1.1); arginine phosphate kinase (
Apk
, EC 2.7.3.3); glucose- 
6
-phosphate isomerase (
Gpi
, EC 5.3.1.9); malate dehydrogenase, supernatant form (
sMdh
, EC 1.1.1.37) and mitochondrial form (
mMdh
, EC 1.1.1.37); mannose- 
6
-phosphate isomerase (
Mpi
, EC 5.3.1.8); and phosphoglucomutase (
Pgm
, EC 5.4.2.2). Four individuals from a reference population, Prospect ON, were included in each assay as mobility standards. Alleles were identified by their mobilities (R f) relative to those of the standard population, averaged over several electrophoretic runs. Of the 
164
collections, 
93
are new to this study, while 
71
have been previously published (

Hebert &amp; Finston 
1997
) by members of the same research group, who were assisted by the first author of the present study. These data were included here to establish the species identity of all populations, and to examine patterns of genetic diversity and structure using as many populations as possible. Alleles within 
2
% mobility could not be reliably distinguished for members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
group. Therefore, three alleles detected in 

Hebert &amp; Finston (
1997
)

have been combined with alleles detected here (i.e. their 

Pgm 
90
was combined with 

Pgm 
92
here; their 

Gpi 
112
has been combined with 

Gpi 
110
; and their 

sAat 
91
has been combined with 

sAat 
93
here).
</p>
         <p>Genotypic characterization of populations.
Allozyme data were entered in the 
NEXUS
computer file format (

Maddison 
et al.1997
) for use with Genetic Data Analysis (
GDA
) software (

Lewis &amp; Zaykin 
1999
). Genotypic frequencies in each population were tested against Hardy-Weinberg (H-W) expectations using Fisher’s exact test (

Fisher 
1935
), excepting populations with sample sizes of less than five. Although cladocerans are cyclically parthenogenetic, one of the assumptions of H-W is sexual reproduction. Nevertheless, these tests are expected to be informative in studying 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
species boundaries. Regular (generally yearly) sex serves to restore heterozygosity, and H-W equilibrium is often observed in cyclic parthenogens. Severe departures from expectations are usually indicative of multi-species assemblages, hybridization, and breeding system shifts. Fixation indices were also calculated from the expected and observed heterozygosities. The fixation index varies from - 
1
for populations that consist solely of heterozygotes to 
1
for populations that show polymorphism but lack heterozygotes.
</p>
         <p>
All collections that were either invariant or in H-W equilibrium were assumed to represent single-species collections. For these populations, a phenogram was contructed based upon Nei’s (
1972
) genetic distances, using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averaging (
UPGMA
), performed in 
GDA
. Levels of intraspecific and interspecific genetic divergence were examined. Allelic profiles of species were initially summarized prior to investigation of those assemblages showing departures from H-W expectations.
</p>
         <p>Species composition of Hardy-Weinberg deviant assemblages.
The results obtained from the allozyme analysis of single-species populations provided a means to probe the nature of those assemblages showing H- W deviations. Upon finding four major allozyme lineages showing diagnostic allelic differences (and noting that these lineages corresponded to major mitochondrial 
DNA
clusters), this made it possible to inspect deviant populations to ascertain whether they contained one or more of the taxa detected in single-species populations. Any genotype (or mtDNA haplotype) from a deviant population that was genetically identical or similar to one from a recognized species was assigned to that taxon. Similarity matrices employing Nei’s (
1978
) genetic identity were constructed for individuals within each population with H-W deviations to ensure that species assignments were concordant with the ranges of intraspecific variability observed for the single-species assemblages.
</p>
         <p>Genetic differentiation among populations.
Wright’s (
1978
) F-statistics were computed using Cockerham &amp; Weir’s (
1993
) methods to examine levels of genetic differentiation among conspecific populations at three hierarchical levels: 
1
) the population, 
2
) the biogeographic province, and 
3
) all North American populations. Biogeographic provinces are defined in 

. Each hierarchical level above the population must contain at least two populations for the F-statistic calculation. In two cases, a biogeographic province (BP) was represented by a single population, and so these populations were grouped with neighbouring biogeographic provinces: Great Slave Lake NT in Yukon-MacKenzie was included in Hudson Bay, and Soldier Pond MI in the Great Lakes was included in N. Appalachian. 
95
% confidence intervals (C.I.) for all F-statistics were obtained in 
GDA
by bootstrapping with 
1,000
pseudoreplicates. When a resulting 
95
% C.I. did not include the value zero, its F-statistic was considered to indicate significant genetic structure at that hierarchical level.
</p>
         <p>
Mitochondrial 
DNA
analysis
</p>
         <p>Sequencing.
A single individual from several populations of the four lineages identified through allozyme analysis were sequenced. In addition, individuals were sequenced from fifteen populations lacking allozyme data because of their preservation in ethanol. Three of these populations were from western Europe, and a fourth was from the Amazon. As allozyme analysis and 
DNA
extraction were often performed at different times, only a few individuals have corresponding allozymic and haplotypic data.
</p>
         <p>
For frozen specimens, total genomic 
DNA
was extracted from single individuals by aliquoting 
1–2
ΜL of whole-body homogenate (which totaled 
4–8
ΜL) into 
30
ΜL of 
6
% Chelex- 
100
(BioRad Inc.). This solution was incubated at 
55
° C for 
12
hrs., next boiled for 
10
min. at 
100
° C, then centrifuged for 
1
min. at 
14,000
rpm, and finally incubated at 
4
° C overnight. The supernatant was then used directly in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (

Saiki 
et al.1988
). The remainder of the whole-body homogenate (
2–7
ΜL) was immediately used in electrophoresis for those individuals with accompanying allozyme data. 
DNA
from samples preserved in ethanol was extracted using the methods of 

Shiozawa 
et al.
(
1992
)

. Preserved animals were soaked individually in a Tris buffer for 
12
hrs., and then homogenized and incubated at 
55
° C for 
18
hrs. in a buffer containing 
75
ΜL 
20
% SDS and 
5
ΜL of 
20 mg
/mL proteinase K solution. 
DNA
was then extracted with two phenol:chloroform and one chloroform wash. 
DNA
was precipitated overnight at - 
20
° C in 
70
% ethanol, and resuspended in 
50
ΜL of Tris-EDTA pH 8.0. Total 
DNA
was also extracted from a specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>Sida crystallina</tp:taxon-name>
from Lake Rosseau ON (

Sequences were verified as cladoceran 
COI
fragments using the 
NCBIBLAST
search (

Altschul 
et al.1990
) and were aligned using Sequence Navigator (Perkin Elmer, version 
1.01
), resulting in a final alignment of 
616
(bp). A pairwise distance matrix for all sequences was constructed, based upon Kimura’s (
1980
) two-parameter model (K 
2
P) of sequence divergence (with pairwise deletion of missing sites), in the program 
MEGA
version 
1.02
(

Kumar 
et al.1993
). This commonly used distance metric was selected to facilitate comparisons of genetic patterns across studies and taxa and because it has previously been found useful at low taxonomic levels. Firstly, the mean pairwise divergence among major lineages (which we will later argue correspond to species) was calculated, and standard errors for these means were obtained using 
1,000
bootstrap replicates. Secondly, the mean and maximum divergences 
within
each of those lineages were calculated, such that patterns of within-lineage versus between-lineage genetic variability could be compared. All sequences were included in these calculations (rather than just unique haplotypes), in order to represent the typical divergence values in the frequencies encountered.
</p>
         <p>
Four sequences from each of five major mtDNA lineages (when available) were selected for inclusion in a phenogram, constructed using the neighbour-joining (NJ) method (

Saitou &amp; Nei 
1987
) performed in 
MEGA
. These haplotypes were selected to maximize the extent of intraspecific variation presented. Complete deletion of missing sites was employed, and bootstrap support for nodes was calculated using 
10,000
replicates. Further details regarding intraspecific mitochondrial patterning, as well as geographic distributions of mtDNA lineages based upon all available sequences, will be presented elsewhere.
</p>
         <p>Morphological analyses</p>
         <p>
Morphology was examined to assess whether the five divergent lineages of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
recognized through genetic analysis can be discriminated using morphological characters. The potential taxonomic value of the array of morphological characters used in previous studies is reviewed in 

Rowe (
2000
)

, where further justification is also provided regarding our choice of characters for inclusion.
</p>
         <p>
Eight to 
29
individuals from 
16
populations representing the five species were selected for morphological analyses. Poor quality of preserved animals prevented many collections, specifically those from the European sites, from being included in the morphological study. Each animal was sexed and examined for eight structural or morphometric characters that were found to be variable in prior taxonomic studies: carapace length (mm), carapace height (mm), carapace (H/L) ratio, number of anal spines on the post-abdomen (counting those on the left and right sides as separate characters), ventral carapace margin spinules, basal spines on the post-abdominal claw, and denticles on the post-abdominal claw. Measurements and meristic counts were performed under a 
40
x

or 
100
x oil immersion objective lens, depending on the sizes of the structures being examined. Colour images of each individual were captured and length measurements were made using the Image- Pro Plus 3.0 image analysis software package (Media Cybernetics).
</p>
         <p>
Summary statistics (mean and variance) for each character were calculated for all populations. Variance components analysis was performed to determine at what hierarchical level (individuals within populations, populations within species, or among species) most morphological variability occurs for each character. Species-level character means were tested for heterogeneity using a one-way analysis of variance, and Tukey’s honestly-significant differences test was performed to determine which pairs of means differed significantly (at a family-wise α = 
0.05
) using the program R version 
2.2
. 
1
(R 

Development Core Team 
2005
). Discriminant function analysis was performed to determine the characters that best separate individuals into the predefined species groups. The percentage of individuals accurately assigned to the genetically identified species based upon post-hoc morphological classification was also recorded. Due to many missing values, two characters (number of anal spines on postabdomen side # 
2
and the number of denticles on the post-abdominal claw) were omitted from the discriminant function analysis.

Large allozyme and mtDNA divergences separated populations belonging to the two initially described species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
. However, further deep and concordant allozyme and mtDNA splits were apparent within each of these groups, indicating the presence of cryptic lineage diversity (see further Results below). We will propose that the five main genetic clusters detected here correspond to species (see Discussion). For clearer presentation and discussion of results, we assign names to these lineages here and provide justification later.
</p>
         <p>
In order to assign names to these species in accordance with the existing taxonomy, phenetic mtDNA placements were examined for those individuals collected from regions near the 
type
localities of the two initially described taxa. The inclusion of three haplotypes from Europe from the region of the 
type
locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
suggests that one of the species from the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
group represents 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>

<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n.sp.</named-content>
Similarly, the sole haplotype collected from the Amazon basin was presumed to correspond to 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
, while the two other (North American) clusters within the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
group are proposed to represent new species (
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n.sp.</named-content>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n.sp.</named-content>
). Rationale for the etymology of all species and criteria permitting their discrimination are presented with the species descriptions.

Allozyme phenotypes were concordant with those expected based on the known quaternary structure of the enzymes (

Ward 
et al.1992
). The 
164<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
collections available for allozyme analysis showed extensive genetic variation, with up to nine alleles detected at one locus (
Gpi
). Eighty-six populations exhibited polymorphism at one or more loci. Five of these populations had sample sizes of fewer than five individuals and were excluded from H-W tests (Herschel Island 
7
NT, First NB, Bee ON, Ellery CA, and Blue Ridge GA). Genotypic frequencies at 
121
sites were either in H-W equilibrium (
44
populations) or were invariant (
77
populations), indicating that each contained a single species. Thirty-eight other populations exhibited significant (p &lt;
0.05
) H-W deviations (

Table 
1
) and were classed as deviant. The populations out of H-W and those with sample sizes of fewer than five individuals were temporarily removed from the data set, but were revisited after examination of populations in H-W equilibrium.

Fisher’s exact tests for deviations in allozyme genotype frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg expectations. Of 164 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
collections assayed for allozyme variation, 38 were found to exhibit significant (p &lt;0.05) departures. Five additional collections had a sample size of less than five, precluding statistical tests, but showed both polymorphism and a lack of heterozygotes. The “diagnosis” column indicates the nature of the deviation (heterozygote excess, heterozygote deficit, or a complete lack of heterozygotes). The next column indicates the presumed reason for these departures: “2 spp.” designates the presence of mixed-species assemblages (based upon the presence of fixed allozyme differences among species in the analysis of single-species assemblages); “br. sys.” indicates that a breeding system shift (to selfing or a similar system) is the most likely explanation for the complete lack of heterozygotes in arctic 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>

         <p>Allozyme divergence among species</p>
         <p>
The 
UPGMA
phenogram based upon Nei’s (
1972
) genetic distances among populations that either exhibited H-W equilibrium or were invariant showed two major groups (

). As the geographic distributions of populations comprising these groups were consistent with the presumed distribution of the two initially described species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium
(

Korovchinsky 
1992
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, these groups were assigned the names 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
. However, the presence of population clusters showing marked genetic divergence within each of these groups suggested that both harbour cryptic diversity. Dividing each of these groups into two putative species resulted in four clusters of populations, each exhibiting both substantial allozyme divergence from the others (Table 
2
) and at least one fixed allozyme difference from all others (Table 
3
). Moreover, these groupings were concordant with deeply divergent clusters based upon mtDNA (see below), suggesting that they correspond to different species that are reproductively isolated and have separate evolutionary trajectories. Average Nei’s distances among species ranged from 
0.36–1.54
, while average distances among populations within species were far more limited, ranging from 
0.05–0.19
(Table 
2
). Maximum intraspecific divergences were also generally lower than for interspecific comparisons, with the exception of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
, which exhibited some larger pairwise distances of up to 
0.57
(Table 
2
).
</p>
         <p>FIGURE 2.
UPGMA phenogram showing genetic distances, based upon allozyme data, among 121 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
populations. Only those collections known to contain a single species, due to being either invariant or in H-W equilibrium, are included here. Nei’s (1972) genetic distance is indicated on the scale bar. The geographic distributions of the two major groups are consistent with those of the two initially described species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
, and these groups are therefore named after these species, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
. New species names are assigned to two clusters on the basis of allozyme, mtDNA, distributional, and morphological information (see text for further information and justification). Asterisks designate those populations for which mtDNA results are available; allozyme and mtDNA clusters are concordant. Double asterisks and haplotype numbers are given for those populations having sequence data presented in Fig. 4.
</p>

Average allele frequencies for each species are shown in Table

or may be obtained from 
CLR
. Members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
species complexes could be distinguished by examining allozyme variation at 
sMdh
. All alleles found in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
complex were slower than those in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
complex. The two species within the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
complex could themselves be distinguished at 
Gpi
, as 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
was monomorphic for 

Gpi 
114
, while 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
never possessed this allele. All but one allele at 
Gpi
(

Gpi 
119
) in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
was slower than the sole 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
allele, 

Gpi 
114
. The two North American members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
complex could be distinguished at 
Pgm
. 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
was fixed for

, while 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
was fixed for

.
</p>
         <p>
Allozyme statistics across populations, organized by species and biogeographic province, are summarized in 

Table 
4
. Average heterozygosities (both observed and expected) were low across all species, indicating both low genetic variability and a tendency towards heterozygote deficit. No heterozygotes were found at all within populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
from the Canadian arctic; these populations are discussed in more detail in Hebert 
et al.
(
2007
).
</p>
         <p>Diagnosis of assemblages showing Hardy-Weinberg deviations</p>
         <p>
The results obtained from analysis of the single-species populations provided a means to investigate the genetic composition of 
43
additional collections, 
38
that were out of H-W and 
5
that had sample sizes of less than five (

Table 
1
). Among these, 
24
sites contained at least one locus exhibiting significant H-W deviation even following sequential Bonferroni correction. Thus, a large proportion of the 
86
sites exhibiting polymorphism deviated from expectations. Based upon the allelic profiles from single-species populations, no F 
1
hybrids were detected in any of the deviant assemblages screened.
</p>
         <p>
Six of the 
43
deviant collections contained two divergent groups of genotypes which were individually similar to genotypes detected in single-species analysis. Verification of this fact was obtained when mtDNA sequencing showed that the same co-occurring individuals possessed haplotypes characteristic of these species (although not all isolates were sequenced) (Appendix A). Therefore, three sites were concluded to consist of co-habiting 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
, while three sites contained both 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
(

Table 
1
).
</p>
         <p>
Seventeen of the 
43
populations appeared to consist solely of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
, but were in H-W disequilibrium. Eleven of these had no heterozygotes at certain loci, but subsequent mtDNA sequencing verified their assignment as 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
. These populations were spread across the range of this species. Seven populations had a heterozygote deficit or excess at either 
Pgm
or 
Gpi
.
</p>
         <p>
Fourteen other populations contained allelic arrays typical of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
but possessed two or more genotypes homozygous for alternate alleles at 
sMdh
, 
sAat
, or both. These populations were restricted to the arctic, and heterozygotes were never detected within them. Four genotypes were identified, with varying proportions of each genotype among populations. The significance of these particular results is discussed in detail in Hebert 
et al.

Allele frequencies at seven loci for the four species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
surveyed for allozyme variation. Relative mobility values (R f values) for all alleles are given in relation to a reference population (see Methods). Allele frequencies are based upon average frequency across all populations of each species (rather than based upon the total number of individuals, which would be more sensitive to differential sample sizes among sites). Asterisks indicate alleles unique to each species. The number of populations, followed by the total number of individuals, analyzed is indicated in parentheses following each species name. The dominant allele for each locus for each species is highlighted in bold. Allele frequencies for each population are available in

either to selfing or automictic parthenogenesis. The corresponding haplotypes of each genotype were very similar or identical, and all were within the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
clade (although not all isolates were sequenced). A single temperate-zone population of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum
, Mayer
</tp:taxon-name>
BC, was also in H-W disequilibrium due to a single individual homozygous for an alternate allele at 
sAat
. Only one population of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
(

Table 
1
) was in H-W disequilibrium, involving a lack of heterozygotes at 
Apk
and 
sAat
. Three populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
were in H-W disequilibrium. Of these, James NC and Santeetlah NC had only heterozygotes at 
Gpi
. The H-W deviation in the Flying Pond ME population resulted from a single individual homozygous for an alternate allele at 
sAat
.
</p>
         <p>Geographic genetic structure</p>
         <p>
The extent of variance in gene frequencies for each species was calculated for all populations, using a three-level hierarchy, increasing from the population level, to the biogeographic province, to all of North 
America
. Two-species assemblages were divided into their component species for this analysis. There was substantial variation in the incidence of H-W disturbances among individuals within local populations, with F IP (=F IS) values ranging from 
0.21– 0.99
(Table 
5
). The North American populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
were distinguished by a very high F IP (
0.99
), suggesting that populations of this species consist of inbred lines (see Hebert 
et al.2007
). Two other species (
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidiphilum</tp:taxon-name>
) displayed lesser, but still significant, evidence of inbreeding.
</p>
         <p>
More overall genetic sub-structuring was due to allozymic differences among populations within biogeographic provinces (F PB values 
0.69–0.89
) than among provinces within all of North 
America
(F BT values 
0.22– 0.59
), signifying marked local but limited regional genetic differentiation in all taxa. However, these values were only occasionally significantly different from zero (see Table 
5
).
</p>
         <p>Intraspecific allelic patterning</p>
         <p>Pgm
, 
Gpi
, and 
Mpi
were monomorphic in all populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
. The four arctic inbred lines can be differentiated by fixed differences at the 
sMdh
and 
sAat
loci (see Hebert 
et al.2007
). The 

sMdh 
85
allele was dominant in the eastern arctic, but was also present in a few western arctic populations. The 

sAat 
107
allele was restricted to the western arctic.
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
showed higher allelic diversity than any other species, but it was also the species most represented in the present study. The same allele was dominant at each locus across its North American range, excepting a few populations in Oregon and Washington, which were fixed for novel alleles at 
Pgm
and 
Gpi
.

Populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
showed considerable variation in allozyme allele frequencies and surprisingly high divergence in mtDNA haplotypes, reflecting the fragmented range of this species. The 
Gpi
locus was, for example, dominated by different alleles on the east and west coasts. The eastern populations were genetically invariant, while the central population had a novel allele at 
Gpi
. One population of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
was in H-W disequilibrium. A lack of heterozygotes at 
Apk
and 
sAat
resulted in disequilibrium in Saunders Pond OR, but 
COI
haplotypes of these homozygous genotypes showed only 
0.1
% divergence.
</p>
         <p>
Populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
showed little variation at most loci, except for 
sAat
, which showed a marked north-south shift from 

sAat 
100
to 

sAat 
91
, a pattern first recognized by 

Hebert &amp; Finston (
1997
)

. Three populations of this species exhibited H-W disequilibrium. Flying Pond ME had no heterozygotes at 
sAat
, while two North Carolinian populations (James and Santeetlah) had only heterozygotes at 
Gpi
. These populations are likely not obligately parthenogenetic due to the presence homozygotes at other loci.

Patterns of

</p>
         <p>
The NJ phenogram (

), which was based upon a sample of the most divergent haplotypes within each major lineage and employed complete deletion of missing sites (resulting in a 
544
bp alignment), showed patterns similar to the allozyme results, indicating that all haplotypes belonged to two major groups. The geographic distribution of populations within the two major groups also corresponded to the presumed distributions of the two initially described species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
. However, there was evidence that each group itself included genetically divergent lineages, supported by high bootstrap values. The 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
group included two main clusters, while the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
group was split into three clusters. The additional cluster identified by mtDNA analysis did not have corresponding allozyme data (frozen South American specimens were not available). We suggest that these five clusters correspond to species, whose genetically confirmed localities, as well as hypothesized overall distributions, are shown in 

. Selecting different sequences from each cluster for the NJ analysis produced the same result, and the pruned datasets also agreed with the phenogram based on all available sequences (not shown here as intraspecific phylogeography will be addressed elsewhere).
</p>
         <p>
Analyzing K

P genetic distances among all haplotypes indicated that levels of genetic divergence within populations were low (&lt;
2
%). Divergences within the major clusters were also modest, with the average distances among sequences ranging from 
0.9–3.2
% (Table 
2
). Maximum value within the five main clusters ranged from a low of 
1.9
% in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>

            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n.sp.</named-content>
(Table

8.7 to 24.5
% s (Table

         <p>Diversity and distributions of haplotypes within species</p>

Twelve 
COI
haplotypes were detected in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
. Haplotype 
2
- 
1
was restricted to populations in the eastern arctic, and the only other haplotype (
2–4
) from this area differed from it by two transversions. Haplotype 
2
– 
2
was the dominant haplotype in the western arctic, but several others were present in this region (
2
–3, 2– 
4
, and 
2–7
to 
2–11
). There was no association between mitochondrial haplotypes and allozyme genotypes for those arctic individuals having joint determination of genetic data (Hebert 
et al.2007
). European populations consisted of closely-related 
COI
haplotypes in 
Norway
and the 
Czech Republic
(
2–5
and 
2–6
, respectively), while a slightly-divergent haplotype (
2–12
) was detected in 
Poland
.
</p>
         <p>
Twenty-five 
COI
haplotypes were found in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
. Sixteen of these (
1

1

1

, 

1– 
10
to 
1

, 1–20, 1– 
21
) were widespread, ranging from Ontario to the Northwest Territories, and south to California. However three haplotypes (
1–7
to 
1–9
) were only found in west-central regions of 
Canada
, and two others (
1
–18, 1– 
19
) were restricted to the arctic. Another group of haplotypes (
1–22
to 
1–25
) was restricted to the Pacific Northwest.
</p>
         <p>
Eighteen individuals from nine populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
having corresponding genotype and haplotype data were examined for association between these markers. However, the small sample size precluded statistical tests, as only a single sequence was available for 
8
of the 
11
multilocus allozyme genotypes detected. Nevertheless, there did not appear to be any clear relationship between nuclear genotype and mitochondrial haplotype. For example, individuals with 
6
different allozyme genotypes possessed haplotype 
1–2
, while a different genotype with a larger sample size of individuals (n = 
5
) exhibited four different 
COI
haplotypes.
</p>
         <p>
No 
COI
haplotype variation was detected in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
, but sampling was limited. Three individuals from a ria lake on the Amazon River possessed the same haplotype (
5
– 
1
).
</p>
         <p>
The six haplotypes of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
clustered into two groups, one including the eastern and central populations (
4
– 
1
and 
4
– 
2
), and the other consisting of western populations (
4
– 
3 to 4
– 
6
).
</p>
         <p>
The six 
COI
haplotypes of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
fell into two groups, a southeastern (

–

) and a northeastern (

There were significant morphological differences among species for all 
8
of the characters examined (Table 
8
). Although most variability in carapace length occurred among populations (
52.6
%), there were significant differences at the species level. In general, individuals from northern taxa (
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
) were significantly larger in size than the taxa with more southerly distributions (
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
) (Table 
8
). Two species in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
complex, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
, were significantly different in size, despite their neighbouring sympatry in New Brunswick. Carapace height followed the same pattern as carapace length. The height/length ratio was significantly greater in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
than in all other species (Table 
8
).

. Postabdominal claws (a) with and (b) without a basal spine are illustrated. The jelly coat is not illustrated.
</p>
         <p>
Structural-count characters also revealed differences among species (Tables 6, 8). There was often withinindividual bilateral asymmetry in the numbers of anal spines on the sides of the postabdomen, but the count never differed by more than three. Although there was some overlap among species, there were significant species-level differences in the anal spine counts. For the postabdomen side # 
1
, within the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
complex, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
had significantly more spines than 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
, but this difference was due to the higher number of anal spines in the sole European population of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
(Table 
6
). In the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
complex, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
possessed more anal spines than either 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
. For the postabdomen side # 
2
, there were only data for members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
complex (due to preservation problems for some samples of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
group); again, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
possessed significantly more spines than either of the other species within this group.
</p>
         <p>
At least some individuals in every population possessed spinules on their ventral carapace margins, but when present, these spinules were always restricted to the posterior half of the carapace. 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
possessed significantly fewer spinules than all other species (Table 
8
). However, there was overlap in spinule counts among populations of different species (Table 
6
). The presence (
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
complex) or absence (
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
complex) of one, or rarely two, basal spines on the postabdominal claw reliably differentiated the two species complexes (Tables 6,8; see 

). All individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
had denticulated claws, while some individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
lacked denticulation. Thus, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
possessed significantly fewer denticulated individuals (Table 
8
), but species diagnosis could not be made on an individual-level basis.
</p>
         <p>Discriminant function analysis</p>
         <p>
Discriminant function (DF) analysis, followed by post-hoc classification, indicated that a majority of individuals (
76
%) could be assigned to the correct species on the basis of six morphological characters (the number of anal spines on postabdomen side # 
2
and denticles on the claw were omitted due to many missing values) (

Table 
9
). The proportion of individuals correctly classified ranged from 
59
% (for 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
) to 
95
% (for 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
). Thus, while there were significant morphological differences among all species, there were few diagnostic differences allowing reliable species discrimination among individuals.
</p>
         <p>
The number of basal spines on the post-abdominal claw was the most important character, being most strongly associated with the first DF (

Table 
9
b) and allowing the separation of members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
species groups (Table 
6
). The presence of at least one basal spine on the claw was an invariable characteristic of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
complex, while members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
complex never possessed a basal spine. Carapace length was most closely associated with the second DF and assisted in the differentiation of species. The number of anal spines on postabdomen side # 
1
was another important character (

Table 
9
b), helping to differentiate 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
(see also Table 
8
). There was no overlap for this trait in population means between 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
and these other two species (Table 
6
).

Adult female carapace lengths range from 
0.53–1.94 mm
(mean 
1.14 mm
), while carapace heights range from 
0.50–2.11 mm
(mean 
1.23 mm
). The H/L ratios range from 
0.88–1.92
(mean 
1.12
). The ventral carapace margins have many, closely-spaced spinules posteriorly, but are ordinarily smooth anteriorly. Individuals lacking spinulation along the entire ventral valve margin were encountered.
</p>
         <p>
Anal spine number is variable, ranging from 
11–42
(mean 
21.3
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
typically possesses at least one basal spine on each postabdominal claw, although there may be up to three, all closely spaced. These spines may be very small, and individual spines may have several points. Each claw has a row of denticles running laterally from the base of the claw to its midpoint.
</p>
         <p>
MALE. Males of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
were described by 

Sars (
1865
)

and 

Lilljeborg (
1901
)

, and their illustrations are reproduced in 

. Males are common in the spring and autumn in the temperate zone, but are apparently absent from arctic habitats, as evidence suggests these populations produce resting eggs by selfing or automictic parthenogenesis (Hebert 
et al.2007
). The jelly coat is present but microsculpturing has not been determined. Mature males are typically smaller than adult females, ranging from 
0.50–1.50 mm
in length (

Korovchinsky 
1992
). Body height is much reduced compared to the female as the dorsal carapace is not extended to accommodate a brood cavity.
</p>
         <p>Differential diagnosis.
Although 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
appears to be morphologically indistinguishable from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
, the two species have largely allopatric distributions (

a,b). Within North 
America
, these species only occur sympatrically in a narrow zone in the arctic. Where they co-occur, there was no evidence of hybridization. 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
can be distinguished from all members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
species complex by its possession of at least one basal spine on each postabdominal claw. North American 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
can be biochemically distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
at the 
Gpi
locus. 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
was never found to possess 

Gpi 
114
, while 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
was monomorphic for this allele. 
COI
mtDNA sequence divergence between 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
averages 
13.1
%. Based on current evidence, individuals showing less than 
2
% divergence from a representative 
COI
mtDNA sequence (GenBank 

AF 
245354
) belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
. However, greater divergences may be found in the future, because other 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
species display higher levels of intraspecific divergence (Table 
2
).
</p>
         <p>Distribution.<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
appears to be the most widely distributed species in the genus (

b). It was found in 
Poland
, the 
Czech Republic
, and 
Norway
, locations that surround the 
type
locality near Kaliningrad, 
Russia
. 

Zaddach (
1855
)

did not specify the exact location of the 
type
locality. 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
also dominates arctic lakes in North 
America
, north of 
67
° N, but is absent from much of the high arctic archipelago, excepting Baffin Island. However, populations occur as far south as 
53
° N in the Coastal Mountain Range of British 
Columbia
. This species occurs on the Queen Charlotte Islands, likely reflecting lineages which persisted in a coastal refugium during the Pleistocene.
</p>
         <p>
There are reports of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
from regions of Europe, Asia, and 
India
which were not sampled in this study. Until critical evaluations are undertaken, it is reasonable to continue to assign these lineages to 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
. Populations in the Himalayas and 
Japan
merit particular attention due to their geographic isolation from populations which have been studied.
</p>
         <p>
The low mtDNA divergence between North American and European populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
suggests a recent (i.e. Pleistocene) exchange of propagules. Such dispersal could perhaps have been influenced by ice floes, as suggested by 

Weider 
et al.
(
1999
)

for 
<tp:taxon-name>Daphnia</tp:taxon-name>
, but greater sampling in Europe would be required to draw conclusions about directionality in 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>Breeding system.
Populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
from the Canadian arctic possess a breeding system unlike congeneric taxa in the temperate zone. Because all populations from this region consist of one to four allozyme genotypes homozygous for alternate alleles, Hebert 
et al.
(
2007
) concluded hat these lineages have made the transition to either automictic parthenogenesis or self-fertilization, the first record of such a breeding system in the Cladocera.
</p>
         <p>
Temperate-zone populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
appear to reproduce via the typical cladoceran mode, cyclic parthenogenesis. Three 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
populations were detected in western British 
Columbia
. Heterozygotes were detected at 
Apk
in Mayer BC. However, the population from Mosquito BC was represented by a single individual that was homozygous for a different allele at 
sMdh
compared to the arctic populations. Genotypic diversity in Prudhomme BC could not be determined due to poor gel resolution. Nevertheless, the presence of heterozygotes in Mayer BC indicates that populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
in the temperate zone likely reproduce by cyclic parthenogenesis, in contrast to automixis employed by their polar counterparts. Males were not detected at these sites (due to the time of year of sampling).

            <p>Morphological description.
FEMALE. Representative photomicrographs are shown in 

. The jelly coat is of the Z 
type
, in which the anterior jelly curl is relatively straight and ends in a short curve posteriorly toward the carapace, and the lateral lobes are divided (see 

Montvilo 
et al.1987
).
</p>
            <p>
Adult female carapace lengths range from 
0.68–1.30 mm
(mean 
0.98 mm
), while carapace heights range from 
0.75–1.82 mm
(mean 
1.26 mm
). The H/L ratios range from 
0.61–1.95
(mean 
1.30
). The ventral carapace margins usually have many, tightly-spaced spinules posteriorly, but are often smooth anteriorly.
</p>
            <p>
Anal spine number is less variable than in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
, ranging from 
11–20
(mean 
15.1
). 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
typically possesses at least one basal spine on each postabdominal claw. Each claw has a row of denticles running laterally from the base of the claw to its midpoint.

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="description">
            <p>
MALE. Males were encountered in autumn collections. The jelly coat is present and resembles that of the female of this species. Mature males are often half the size of adult females, with individuals ranging from 
0.40–0.63 mm
in length (
CLR
, pers. obs.). The ventral carapace margin is spinulated posteriorly, but is smooth anteriorly.
</p>
            <p>
The postabdomen is long and terminates posteriorly with two postabdominal claws. A single row of anal spines runs ventro-laterally on each side of the postabdomen (range 
13–17
). There is one basal spine on each postabdominal claw, and each claw invariably has a row of denticles running laterally from the base of the claw to its midpoint.
</p>
            <p>Differential diagnosis.<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
can be distinguished from all members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
species complex by its possession of at least one basal spine on each postabdominal claw. It is morphologically indistinguishable from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
, although they have largely allopatric distributions (

a,b). 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
can be biochemically distinguished from North American 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
at the 
Gpi
locus. 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
was never found to possess 

Gpi

<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>

COI
mtDNA sequence divergence between 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>

13.1

presumably occurs over most of the formerly glaciated regions of North

(

a), from the Coastal and Rocky Mountain ranges in the west through to the Atlantic coast in the east, excepting the central Great Plains, where habitats with suitable water chemistry are absent (see 

Rowe 
2000
for a discussion of the ecological requirements of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
). It occurs as far south as the Sierra Nevada mountains of California and the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, but in the east there are no confirmed populations south of New York State. It occurs sympatrically with 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
in New Brunswick and Maine, with no evidence of hybridization. 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
is also present in the Canadian arctic, but not north of 
68.5

latitude. The northernmost habitats were a few lakes on the Melville Peninsula, including three in which it was sympatric with 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
, again with no evidence of hybridization.
</p>
            <p>Breeding system.
Many populations were invariant, but 
43
of 
59
polymorphic populations were in H-W equilibrium, suggesting that at least these populations reproduce by cyclical parthenogenesis. Males were discovered in several populations in the spring and in larger numbers in the autumn. The few single-species populations in H-W disequilibrium were due to occasional heterozygote excesses or deficits, patterns that may result from extended bouts of asexual reproduction.

d). This species was not found to co-occur with other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
. Despite concentrated sampling within this range, this species was found rarely. It occurred in three lakes and one pond on the west coast of Oregon, a small pond on the upper Michigan peninsula, and two bogs in southeastern New Brunswick. The eastern bog habitats were situated within a few kilometers of lake populations of both 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
, but there was no evidence of genetic exchange as indicated by distinctive allozyme and mtDNA profiles. In the west, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
was found in coastal lakes and ponds in Oregon, while the nearest populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
were in lakes in the Coastal Mountains.
</p>
            <p>Breeding system.
Males were detected in the eastern populations in mid June and late September, indicating that members of these populations are cyclical parthenogens. Males were not detected in western and central populations, but this was likely because they were sampled in the summer. Moreover, genotype frequencies were generally concordant with Hardy-Weinberg expectations.

MALE. Males have been found in small numbers in collections from sites in North Carolina in May and June; however, they are typically found in the highest abundance in the autumn (

Hegyi 
1973
). Males of this species were not examined in this study, and thus detailed morphometrics cannot be presented. However, 

Hegyi (

Although 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
is morphologically indistinguishable from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
, these two species have allopatric distributions reducing the likelihood of genetic exchange (

c,e). 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
is distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
by the larger size and greater number of anal spines of the latter species. It differs from members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
complex by the absence of a basal spine on either postabdominal claw. 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
can be biochemically distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
at the 
Pgm
locus, as 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
produces an enzyme which migrates slower than that of the latter species.

c). Populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
reported by other workers from the southeastern 
United States
are likely also 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
. Its range overlaps that of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
in the northeastern 
USA
and southern New Brunswick, where these species occur sympatrically without hybridization. The extent of range overlap with 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
is unresolved by this study, but several workers have identified 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
(formerly 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
) as far north as New Brunswick and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
(formerly 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
) as far south as Tennessee and possibly South Carolina (

            <p>Breeding system.
Males were not detected in populations collected throughout the summer in this study. In a life history study spanning two years, males were most abundant in early spring and late autumn (

Hegyi 
1973
). In some southern localities, populations persist throughout the winter. Due to the existence of males, this species likely reproduces by cyclic parthenogenesis, but there is very little allozyme variation, suggesting that either this species engages in sexual reproduction infrequently or that variation has been trimmed due to a population bottleneck.

<tp:taxon-name>H. groenlandicum</tp:taxon-name>

            </p>
            <p>
While individuals from 
Greenland
were not included in the present study, the recently described species 
<tp:taxon-name>H. groenlandicum
(

Korovchinsky 
2005
)
</tp:taxon-name>
can purportedly be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
by its “dorsally low shell and jelly envelope, shorter row of valve marginal spinules which are subdivided in groups, and comparatively longer postabdominal claws.” However, shell shape is a highly variable feature, which may be environmentally influenced (

Røen 
1962
) and can depend upon the locality and presence/absence of fish (
CLR
pers. obs). The body lengths (
0.74 to 1.09mm
, mean 
1.45mm
), carapace heights (
0.80 to 1.57mm
, mean 
1.19mm
), and H:L ratios (
0.641 to 1.000
, mean 
0.814
) found by 

Korovchinsky (
2005
)

in the 
Greenland
populations fall within the ranges of values found in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
populations in the present study (the preceding ranges and means that were not published in 

Korovchinsky [
2005
]

were provided to 
CLR
by that author). Jelly coat shape may be influenced by preservation (
CLR
, pers. obs), and therefore this trait may not be a good feature for diagnosing species. Moreover, the degree of carapace margin spinulation is also a highly variable trait within species (present study), although the discontinuous nature of the spinulation in the 
Greenland
populations is noteworthy. Finally, the length of the postabdominal claws reported by 

Korovchinsky (
2005
, his 

)

is within the range of claw lengths observed for the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
populations studied here. Furthermore, the fact that we detected closely related lineages of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
in both northern Europe and North 
America
suggests that similar lineages may be found in intervening arctic areas.
</p>
            <p>
Individuals from 
India
were also not included in the present study. Consideration of the differences between either of the species in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
complex and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. ramasarmii
(

Rao 
et al.1998
)
</tp:taxon-name>
is not currently possible due to the poor description of the latter species, lacking in detail. 

Korovchinsky (
2004
)

labeled this species 
incertae sedis
.
</p>
            <p>
We suggest that genetic evidence is required to determine if 
<tp:taxon-name>H. groenlandicum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. ramasarmii</tp:taxon-name>
are distinct species or if they are synonymous with described taxa.

FEMALE. Representative photomicrographs are shown in 

. The jelly coat is of the Z 
type
, in which the anterior jelly curl is relatively straight and ends in a short curve posteriorly toward the carapace, and the lateral lobes are divided (see 

Montvilo 
et al.1987
).
</p>
            <p>
Adult female carapace lengths range from 
0.68–1.30 mm
(mean 
0.98 mm
), while carapace heights range from 
0.75–1.82 mm
(mean 
1.26 mm
). The H/L ratios range from 
0.61–1.95
(mean 
1.30
). The ventral carapace margins usually have many, tightly-spaced spinules posteriorly, but are often smooth anteriorly.
</p>
            <p>
Anal spine number is less variable than in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>

11–20
(mean 
15.1

<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
typically possesses at least one basal spine on each postabdominal claw. Each claw has a row of denticles running laterally from the base of the claw to its midpoint.

MALE. Males were encountered in autumn collections. The jelly coat is present and resembles that of the female of this species. Mature males are often half the size of adult females, with individuals ranging from 
0.40–0.63 mm
in length (
CLR
, pers. obs.). The ventral carapace margin is spinulated posteriorly, but is smooth anteriorly.
</p>
            <p>
The postabdomen is long and terminates posteriorly with two postabdominal claws. A single row of anal spines runs ventro-laterally on each side of the postabdomen (range 
13–17
). There is one basal spine on each postabdominal claw, and each claw invariably has a row of denticles running laterally from the base of the claw to its midpoint.

Rowe 
2000

            <p>Breeding system.
Many populations were invariant, but 
43
of 
59
polymorphic populations were in H-W equilibrium, suggesting that at least these populations reproduce by cyclical parthenogenesis. Males were discovered in several populations in the spring and in larger numbers in the autumn. The few single-species populations in H-W disequilibrium were due to occasional heterozygote excesses or deficits, patterns that may result from extended bouts of asexual reproduction.

            <p>Differential diagnosis.
Although 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
is morphologically indistinguishable from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
, these two species have allopatric distributions reducing the likelihood of genetic exchange (

c,e). 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
is distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
by the larger size and greater number of anal spines of the latter species. It differs from members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
complex by the absence of a basal spine on either postabdominal claw. 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
can be biochemically distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
at the 
Pgm
locus, as 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
produces an enzyme which migrates slower than that of the latter species. 
COI
mtDNA sequence divergence between 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
averages 
12.3

<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
averages 
10.6
%. Based on current evidence, individuals showing less than 
4.8
% divergence from a representative 
COI
mtDNA sequence (GenBank 

AF

            <p>Distribution.<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
was found along the Atlantic coast of North 
America
from New Brunswick and Maine south to Florida, (

c). Populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
reported by other workers from the southeastern 
United States
are likely also 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
. Its range overlaps that of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
in the northeastern 
USA
and southern New Brunswick, where these species occur sympatrically without hybridization. The extent of range overlap with 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
is unresolved by this study, but several workers have identified 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
(formerly 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
) as far north as New Brunswick and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
(formerly 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
) as far south as Tennessee and possibly South Carolina (

            <p>Breeding system.
Males were not detected in populations collected throughout the summer in this study. In a life history study spanning two years, males were most abundant in early spring and late autumn (

Hegyi 
1973
). In some southern localities, populations persist throughout the winter. Due to the existence of males, this species likely reproduces by cyclic parthenogenesis, but there is very little allozyme variation, suggesting that either this species engages in sexual reproduction infrequently or that variation has been trimmed due to a population bottleneck.

A note regarding 
<tp:taxon-name>H. groenlandicum</tp:taxon-name>

            </p>

While individuals from 
Greenland
were not included in the present study, the recently described species 
<tp:taxon-name>H. groenlandicum
(

Korovchinsky 
2005
)
</tp:taxon-name>
can purportedly be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
by its “dorsally low shell and jelly envelope, shorter row of valve marginal spinules which are subdivided in groups, and comparatively longer postabdominal claws.” However, shell shape is a highly variable feature, which may be environmentally influenced (

Røen 
1962
) and can depend upon the locality and presence/absence of fish (
CLR
pers. obs). The body lengths (
0.74 to 1.09mm
, mean 
1.45mm
), carapace heights (
0.80 to 1.57mm
, mean 
1.19mm
), and H:L ratios (
0.641 to 1.000
, mean 
0.814
) found by 

Korovchinsky (
2005
)

in the 
Greenland
populations fall within the ranges of values found in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
populations in the present study (the preceding ranges and means that were not published in 

Korovchinsky [
2005
]

were provided to 
CLR
by that author). Jelly coat shape may be influenced by preservation (
CLR
, pers. obs), and therefore this trait may not be a good feature for diagnosing species. Moreover, the degree of carapace margin spinulation is also a highly variable trait within species (present study), although the discontinuous nature of the spinulation in the 
Greenland
populations is noteworthy. Finally, the length of the postabdominal claws reported by 

Korovchinsky (
2005
, his 

)

is within the range of claw lengths observed for the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
populations studied here. Furthermore, the fact that we detected closely related lineages of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
in both northern Europe and North 
America
suggests that similar lineages may be found in intervening arctic areas.
</p>
            <p>
Individuals from 
India
were also not included in the present study. Consideration of the differences between either of the species in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
complex and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. ramasarmii
(

Rao 
et al.1998
)
</tp:taxon-name>
is not currently possible due to the poor description of the latter species, lacking in detail. 

Korovchinsky (
2004
)

labeled this species 
incertae sedis
.
</p>
            <p>
We suggest that genetic evidence is required to determine if 
<tp:taxon-name>H. groenlandicum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. ramasarmii</tp:taxon-name>
are distinct species or if they are synonymous with described taxa.

            <p>Morphological description.
FEMALE. Representative photomicrographs are shown in 

. The jelly coat is of the Z 
type
, in which the anterior jelly curl is relatively straight and ends in a short curve posteriorly toward the carapace, and the lateral lobes are divided (see 

Montvilo 
et al.1987
).
</p>
            <p>
Adult female carapace lengths range from 
0.68–1.30 mm
(mean 
0.98 mm
), while carapace heights range from 
0.75–1.82 mm
(mean 
1.26 mm
). The H/L ratios range from 
0.61–1.95
(mean 
1.30
). The ventral carapace margins usually have many, tightly-spaced spinules posteriorly, but are often smooth anteriorly.
</p>
            <p>
Anal spine number is less variable than in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
, ranging from 
11–20
(mean 
15.1
). 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
typically possesses at least one basal spine on each postabdominal claw. Each claw has a row of denticles running laterally from the base of the claw to its midpoint.

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="description">
            <p>
MALE. Males were encountered in autumn collections. The jelly coat is present and resembles that of the female of this species. Mature males are often half the size of adult females, with individuals ranging from 
0.40–0.63 mm
in length (
CLR
, pers. obs.). The ventral carapace margin is spinulated posteriorly, but is smooth anteriorly.
</p>
            <p>
The postabdomen is long and terminates posteriorly with two postabdominal claws. A single row of anal spines runs ventro-laterally on each side of the postabdomen (range 
13–17
). There is one basal spine on each postabdominal claw, and each claw invariably has a row of denticles running laterally from the base of the claw to its midpoint.
</p>
            <p>Differential diagnosis.<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
can be distinguished from all members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
species complex by its possession of at least one basal spine on each postabdominal claw. It is morphologically indistinguishable from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
, although they have largely allopatric distributions (

a,b). 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
can be biochemically distinguished from North American 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
at the 
Gpi
locus. 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
was never found to possess 

Gpi 
114
, while 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
was monomorphic for this allele. 
COI
mtDNA sequence divergence between 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
averages 
13.1
%. Based on current evidence, individuals showing less than 
4.3
% divergence from a representative 
COI
mtDNA sequence (GenBank 

AF 
245355
) belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>Distribution.<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
presumably occurs over most of the formerly glaciated regions of North 
America
(

a), from the Coastal and Rocky Mountain ranges in the west through to the Atlantic coast in the east, excepting the central Great Plains, where habitats with suitable water chemistry are absent (see 

Rowe 
2000
for a discussion of the ecological requirements of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
). It occurs as far south as the Sierra Nevada mountains of California and the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, but in the east there are no confirmed populations south of New York State. It occurs sympatrically with 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
in New Brunswick and Maine, with no evidence of hybridization. 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
is also present in the Canadian arctic, but not north of 
68.5
° N

latitude. The northernmost habitats were a few lakes on the Melville Peninsula, including three in which it was sympatric with 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
, again with no evidence of hybridization.
</p>
            <p>Breeding system.
Many populations were invariant, but 
43
of 
59
polymorphic populations were in H-W equilibrium, suggesting that at least these populations reproduce by cyclical parthenogenesis. Males were discovered in several populations in the spring and in larger numbers in the autumn. The few single-species populations in H-W disequilibrium were due to occasional heterozygote excesses or deficits, patterns that may result from extended bouts of asexual reproduction.

<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>

Males were not detected in populations collected throughout the summer in this study. In a life history study spanning two years, males were most abundant in early spring and late autumn (

Hegyi 
1973
). In some southern localities, populations persist throughout the winter. Due to the existence of males, this species likely reproduces by cyclic parthenogenesis, but there is very little allozyme variation, suggesting that either this species engages in sexual reproduction infrequently or that variation has been trimmed due to a population bottleneck.

While individuals from 
Greenland
were not included in the present study, the recently described species 
<tp:taxon-name>H. groenlandicum
(

Korovchinsky 
2005
)
</tp:taxon-name>
can purportedly be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
by its “dorsally low shell and jelly envelope, shorter row of valve marginal spinules which are subdivided in groups, and comparatively longer postabdominal claws.” However, shell shape is a highly variable feature, which may be environmentally influenced (

Røen 
1962
) and can depend upon the locality and presence/absence of fish (
CLR
pers. obs). The body lengths (
0.74 to 1.09mm
, mean 
1.45mm
), carapace heights (
0.80 to 1.57mm
, mean 
1.19mm
), and H:L ratios (
0.641 to 1.000
, mean 
0.814
) found by 

Korovchinsky (
2005
)

in the 
Greenland
populations fall within the ranges of values found in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
populations in the present study (the preceding ranges and means that were not published in 

Korovchinsky [
2005
]

were provided to 
CLR
by that author). Jelly coat shape may be influenced by preservation (
CLR
, pers. obs), and therefore this trait may not be a good feature for diagnosing species. Moreover, the degree of carapace margin spinulation is also a highly variable trait within species (present study), although the discontinuous nature of the spinulation in the 
Greenland
populations is noteworthy. Finally, the length of the postabdominal claws reported by 

Korovchinsky (
2005
, his 

)

is within the range of claw lengths observed for the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
populations studied here. Furthermore, the fact that we detected closely related lineages of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
in both northern Europe and North 
America
suggests that similar lineages may be found in intervening arctic areas.
</p>
            <p>
Individuals from 
India
were also not included in the present study. Consideration of the differences between either of the species in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
complex and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. ramasarmii
(

Rao 
et al.1998

</tp:taxon-name>
is not currently possible due to the poor description of the latter species, lacking in detail. 

Korovchinsky (

labeled this species 
incertae sedis
.
</p>
            <p>
We suggest that genetic evidence is required to determine if 
<tp:taxon-name>H. groenlandicum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. ramasarmii</tp:taxon-name>
are distinct species or if they are synonymous with described taxa.

            <p>Morphological description.
FEMALE. Representative photomicrographs are shown in 

. The jelly coat is of the Z 
type
, in which the anterior jelly curl is relatively straight and ends in a short curve posteriorly toward the carapace, and the lateral lobes are divided (see 

Montvilo 
et al.1987
).
</p>
            <p>
Adult female carapace lengths range from 
0.68–1.30 mm
(mean 
0.98 mm
), while carapace heights range from 
0.75–1.82 mm
(mean 
1.26 mm
). The H/L ratios range from 
0.61–1.95
(mean 
1.30
). The ventral carapace margins usually have many, tightly-spaced spinules posteriorly, but are often smooth anteriorly.
</p>
            <p>
Anal spine number is less variable than in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
, ranging from 
11–20
(mean 
15.1
). 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
typically possesses at least one basal spine on each postabdominal claw. Each claw has a row of denticles running laterally from the base of the claw to its midpoint.

         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="description">
            <p>
MALE. Males were encountered in autumn collections. The jelly coat is present and resembles that of the female of this species. Mature males are often half the size of adult females, with individuals ranging from 
0.40–0.63 mm
in length (
CLR
, pers. obs.). The ventral carapace margin is spinulated posteriorly, but is smooth anteriorly.
</p>
            <p>
The postabdomen is long and terminates posteriorly with two postabdominal claws. A single row of anal spines runs ventro-laterally on each side of the postabdomen (range 
13–17
). There is one basal spine on each postabdominal claw, and each claw invariably has a row of denticles running laterally from the base of the claw to its midpoint.
</p>
            <p>Differential diagnosis.<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
can be distinguished from all members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
species complex by its possession of at least one basal spine on each postabdominal claw. It is morphologically indistinguishable from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
, although they have largely allopatric distributions (

a,b). 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
can be biochemically distinguished from North American 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
at the 
Gpi
locus. 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
was never found to possess 

Gpi

<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>

COI
mtDNA sequence divergence between 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>

13.1

presumably occurs over most of the formerly glaciated regions of North

(

Rowe 
2000
for a discussion of the ecological requirements of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
). It occurs as far south as the Sierra Nevada mountains of California and the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, but in the east there are no confirmed populations south of New York State. It occurs sympatrically with 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
in New Brunswick and Maine, with no evidence of hybridization. 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
is also present in the Canadian arctic, but not north of 
68.5

latitude. The northernmost habitats were a few lakes on the Melville Peninsula, including three in which it was sympatric with 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
, again with no evidence of hybridization.
</p>
            <p>Breeding system.
Many populations were invariant, but 
43
of 
59
polymorphic populations were in H-W equilibrium, suggesting that at least these populations reproduce by cyclical parthenogenesis. Males were discovered in several populations in the spring and in larger numbers in the autumn. The few single-species populations in H-W disequilibrium were due to occasional heterozygote excesses or deficits, patterns that may result from extended bouts of asexual reproduction.

It occurred in three lakes and one pond on the west coast of Oregon, a small pond on the upper Michigan peninsula, and two bogs in southeastern New Brunswick. The eastern bog habitats were situated within a few kilometers of lake populations of both 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
, but there was no evidence of genetic exchange as indicated by distinctive allozyme and mtDNA profiles. In the west, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
was found in coastal lakes and ponds in Oregon, while the nearest populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
were in lakes in the Coastal Mountains.

Males were detected in the eastern populations in mid June and late September, indicating that members of these populations are cyclical parthenogens. Males were not detected in western and central populations, but this was likely because they were sampled in the summer.

MALE. Males have been found in small numbers in collections from sites in North Carolina in May and June; however, they are typically found in the highest abundance in the autumn (

<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
is distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
by the larger size and greater number of anal spines of the latter species. It differs from members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
complex by the absence of a basal spine on either postabdominal claw. 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
can be biochemically distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
at the 
Pgm
locus, as 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
produces an enzyme which migrates slower than that of the latter species.

<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
(formerly

<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>

Males were not detected in populations collected throughout the summer in this study. In a life history study spanning two years, males were most abundant in early spring and late autumn (

Hegyi 
1973
). In some southern localities, populations persist throughout the winter. Due to the existence of males, this species likely reproduces by cyclic parthenogenesis, but there is very little allozyme variation, suggesting that either this species engages in sexual reproduction infrequently or that variation has been trimmed due to a population bottleneck.

While individuals from 
Greenland
were not included in the present study, the recently described species 
<tp:taxon-name>H. groenlandicum
(

Korovchinsky

</tp:taxon-name>
can purportedly be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
by its “dorsally low shell and jelly envelope, shorter row of valve marginal spinules which are subdivided in groups, and comparatively longer postabdominal claws.” However, shell shape is a highly variable feature, which may be environmentally influenced (

Røen 
1962
) and can depend upon the locality and presence/absence of fish (
CLR
pers. obs). The body lengths (
0.74 to 1.09mm
, mean 
1.45mm
), carapace heights (
0.80 to 1.57mm

1.19mm

0.641 to 1.000
, mean 
0.814
) found by 

Korovchinsky (

in the 
Greenland
populations fall within the ranges of values found in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
populations in the present study (the preceding ranges and means that were not published in 

Korovchinsky [
2005
]

were provided to 
CLR
by that author). Jelly coat shape may be influenced by preservation (
CLR
, pers. obs), and therefore this trait may not be a good feature for diagnosing species. Moreover, the degree of carapace margin spinulation is also a highly variable trait within species (present study), although the discontinuous nature of the spinulation in the 
Greenland
populations is noteworthy. Finally, the length of the postabdominal claws reported by 

Korovchinsky (
2005
, his 

)

is within the range of claw lengths observed for the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
populations studied here. Furthermore, the fact that we detected closely related lineages of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
in both northern Europe and North 
America
suggests that similar lineages may be found in intervening arctic areas.
</p>
            <p>

were also not included in the present study. Consideration of the differences between either of the species in the

complex and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. ramasarmii
(

Diversity of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
         </p>
         <p>
Many past investigations have failed to recognize more than two species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
. In fact, due to their limited geographic scale, most studies only recognized a single species. Early studies that did cover a larger scale focused mainly on morphological criteria, and the lack of such variation did little to advance understanding of the taxonomic diversity in the genus. Initial genetic surveys were also geographically restricted and therefore were unable to critically examine the diversity of the genus on a large scale.
</p>
         <p>
Thier (
1994
)

was the first to examine the patterning of genetic diversity in 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
. He found marked heterozygote deficiencies in several New 
England
populations, but he did not consider that the two common homozygote classes might be different species. A larger scale allozyme study encompassing lakes from Thier’s study area provided clear evidence for the co-occurrence of two 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
species in eastern North 
America
(

Hebert &amp; Finston 
1997
). Even this study was limited, however, in that it did not include samples from 
type
localities, so species identification remained uncertain.
</p>
         <p>
In the present study, 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
was collected from across North 
America
and from a few sites in Europe and South 
America
. In order to validate species identifications, comparisons were made with individuals collected from regions near the 
type
localities of the two species that are generally recognized (since the precise 
type
locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
is unknown and that for 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
is subject to seasonal flooding of the Amazon). Patterns of variation in both biochemical and sequence markers provided support for the presence of two major lineages of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
that corresponded with the presumed geographic distribution of the two initially-described species, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
. However, the results also revealed further genetic divergence within each of these lineages.
</p>
         <p>
Allozyme and mtDNA results indicated that the North American populations in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
complex were divided into two divergent groups. One was distributed throughout temperate North 
America
, while the other was found in arctic North 
America
, and along the west coast of British 
Columbia
. Individuals from European populations, which are much nearer to the 
type
locality for 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
, consistently fell within the arctic 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
group, suggesting that this clade is 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
Its sister taxon, found throughout temperate North 
America
, is apparently an undescribed taxon. This species is described above as 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
, due to its distribution across many formerly glaciated regions.
</p>
         <p>
Allozyme and 
COI
results showed that the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
complex consisted of two highly distinctive groups in North 
America
. Due to their mtDNA divergence from individuals belonging to a third cluster, collected from the region of the 
type
locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
, these North American taxa apparently represent unknown species. 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
, described above, occupies bogs, ponds, and lakes across middle latitudes of North 
America
, while 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
is found along eastern North 
America
. 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
is apparently restricted to the Amazon basin.
</p>
         <p>Undescribed species or conspecific populations?</p>
         <p>
Molecular and biochemical data indicate that there are five distinct evolutionary lineages among our collections of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
. Several lines of evidence suggest that these clades merit recognition as distinct species. First, the clades meet the phylogenetic species criterion of diagnosability (

Davis &amp; Nixon 
1992
) as each can be distinguished from all other in-group taxa.
</p>
         <p>
Secondly, the extent of genetic divergence between clades is substantially greater than that within clades, on average by nine-fold for the allozymes and twelve-fold for mtDNA. Moreover, the entire range of mtDNA divergences observed within species is completely non-overlapping with the interspecies range. The allozyme results are similar but with a lone exception. Large allozyme divergences are observed between allopatric groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
, but jointly considered morphological, habitat, and genetic data do not currently justify the splitting of this taxon, although the different groups might be considered incipient species. The patterns of genetic variability within and amongst the five main clades identified here thus substantiate the view that they are distinct phylogenetic species rather than just genetically divergent populations of a single species. Such disjunctions between intra- and interspecific genetic diversity are found in other crustaceans as well. Following large-scale surveys and further methodological development, this pattern is expected to be a highly useful tool for species identification (

Costa et al. 
2007
).
</p>
         <p>
Third, three of the allozyme loci are diagnostic, exhibiting fixed allelic differences. Allelic variation at 
Pgm
, 
Gpi
, and 
sMdh
provide diagnostic markers that allow discrimination of at least the four species which occur in North 
America
. Moreover, several of the clades maintain this genetic divergence despite their neighbouring or actual sympatry. For example, the ranges of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
overlap in the North American arctic, with the two species co-occuring at three sites with no evidence of hybridization. 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
were similarly found to coexist in three lakes in eastern North 
America
without hybridization. Finally, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
occurs within the range of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
but never interbreeds with them. Therefore, these clades clearly have unique evolutionary histories and appear to be reproductively isolated. Thus, these concordant pieces of evidence support the conclusion that the five genetic lineages of 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
represent five non-hybridizing species.
</p>
         <p>Morphologically intermediate forms revisited</p>
         <p>
The present study establishes that the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
species groups can be easily distinguished with morphological criteria. In fact, they are reliably separated by the presence or absence of basal spines on the postabdominal claw, and by the divergent morphologies of their jelly coat (

Tessier 
1986
). Past suggestions that there is only a single 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
species, due to the presence of morphologically intermediate individuals in eastern North 
America
, were due to flawed taxonomy. The recognition that separate species in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
complex have ventral carapace margin spinulation, and vary considerably in the number of anal spines, eliminates the taxonomic puzzle associated with most of these intermediates. In addition, the ranges of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticum</tp:taxon-name>
overlap extensively in eastern North 
America
, and these species coexist in several habitats. Although they did not recognize it, descriptions given by several authors suggest they may have also encountered these two species in sympatry (e.g., 

Carpenter 
1931
; 

Coker 
1938
; 

Bunting 
1970
; 

Hegyi 
1973
; 

Korovchinsky 
1992
; 

Thier 
1994
).
</p>
         <p>
By contrast, species within each of these groups are largely morphologically cryptic, with the exception of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. acidophilum</tp:taxon-name>
in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
group. However, both species in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. gibberum</tp:taxon-name>
cluster occur in sympatry without evidence of hybridization. Similarly, two species in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
group occur in neighbouring sympatry in eastern North 
America
without hybridization. The third species in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
cluster (
<tp:taxon-name>H. amazonicum</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">s.s.</named-content>
) has an allopatric geographic range, reducing the probability of genetic exchange, and contributing to the marked mitochondrial divergence from all other species. Therefore, despite the lack of clear, diagnostic morphological differences, we suggest that the five genetic species warrant recognition as species, described above. We present both biochemical and morphological/ distributional keys to these five species below in Appendix B. Future morphological work, perhaps involving scanning electron miscroscopy on the fine structure of limbs, may yet reveal subtle diagnostic traits and will contribute to a greater understanding of the evolutionary divergence of these species.
</p>
         <p>Summary and future directions</p>
         <p>
This study presents the first broad, genetics-based assessment of species boundaries in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
. Discontinuity in the amounts of within- and between-clade genetic differentiation, as well as the presence of diagnostic molecular characters (despite their adjacent and overlapping ranges), indicate that the five clades found in this study are genetically distinct and represent evolutionarily independent groups. The identification of lineages by both mitochondrial sequence data and multiple allozyme loci indicates that they are not simply a reflection of the history of a single gene, but rather represent separate species.
</p>
         <p>
Such genetic surveys may help to elucidate both the extent and the origins of biological diversity. Previous researchers have proposed that surveys of both highly diverse and species-poor cladoceran groups will be necessary to enhance our understanding of cladoceran diversity and evolutionary history (Hebert &amp; Taylor 
1997
). This study has indeed revealed that taxonomic diversity was greater than previously supposed for the low-diversity genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
, similar to findings for other branchiopod crustaceans whose diversity has been evaluated from a genetic perspective (reviewed in 

Adamowicz &amp; Purvis 
2005
; 

Korn &amp; Hundsdoerfer 
2006
). With a ratio of total species: morphologically known species of at least 
5
: 
2
among our samples, 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
is among those branchiopod groups most poorly known from morphology alone (

Adamowicz &amp; Purvis 
2005
). However, interestingly, 
<tp:taxon-name>Daphnia</tp:taxon-name>
had quite similar levels of undescribed species diversity prior to genetic investigation (such as a ratio of 
2.33
: 
1
for North 
America
). Thus, levels of (in)completeness of taxonomic knowledge were similar between these genera, both of which are widely distributed but which have very different levels of global species diversity. Therefore, while these genetic surveys have advanced our understanding of taxonomic diversity, and of the ubiquity of (nearly) cryptic diversity in the branchiopods, they have not yet revealed reasons for differing levels of species diversity among branchiopod groups.

         <p>
Additional research, taking a phylogenetic perspective, will be required to address diversity patterns among cladocerans. Two avenues that may be fruitful would be to compare the propensity for dispersal and allopatric divergence across groups and to investigate whether there are different potentials for habitat transitions. Habitat shifts between lake and pond environments appear to be an important mechanism of speciation in 
<tp:taxon-name>Daphnia</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g. 

Taylor 
et al.1996
; 

Schwenk 
et al.2000
) and possibly in 
<tp:taxon-name>Bosmina
(DeMelo and 

Hebert 
1994
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, but do not seem to be operating to the same extent in 
<tp:taxon-name>Sida</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Holopedium</tp:taxon-name>
. Multidisciplinary surveys including genetic analyses, such as the present one, provide a solid taxonomic foundation for such further studies of distribution and evolutionary patterns that should aid in our understanding of diversification in the freshwater realm.

All allelic mobilities employed in this key are relative to the dominant allele in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. glacialis</tp:taxon-name>
from the reference site Prospect Lake, Ontario (see Methods), with allozymes analyzed on cellulose acetate gels in a Tris glycine (pH 
8.5

thus indicates an allozyme product with the same mobility as that of the reference population, while 
113
indicates an allele having 
13
% greater mobility. Note that

was not included in the allozyme analysis and is therefore excluded from this key.
