Three barracudina species are recognized in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
species complex, which includes 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis rothschildiRichards, 1967</tp:taxon-name>
, and two new species described herein. 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis multifasciatus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
is described based on five specimens collected off northwestern 
Australia
and 
Myanmar
, Eastern Indian Ocean. It is characterized by having 16 brownish blotches on dorsum (10 before dorsal-fin origin); 49–51 caudal vertebrae; 93–95 total vertebrae; dorsal-fin origin relatively forward in position, distance between origins of pelvic and dorsal fins 52.3–63.0% of distance between origins of pelvic and anal fins; and combination of body proportions. 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis retrodorsalis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
is described based on 
15 specimens
collected from off the 
Philippines
, 
Indonesia
and northwestern 
Australia
. It is characterized by having dorsal-fin origin at about vertical through anal-fin origin, insertion of anal fin relatively forward, preanal length 71.5–79.5% SL; 6 blotches on dorsum before DFO and 4 on abdominal ridge before VFO and unique combination of body proportions. A redescription of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
, based on specimens collected from off Dongsha (Pratas) Islands, 
Australia
and West Indies, is also included.

         <p>
The slender barracudina genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
currently comprises 12 valid species, although there may be some changes in the validity or generic assignment of some species (Ho, unpub. data). 
Ege (1933
, 
1957
) described many new species under the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Macroparalepis</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Harry (1951)
established the new genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
(
type
species 
<tp:taxon-name>Macroparalepis intermediusEge, 1933</tp:taxon-name>
), which includes all the species in the group II of 
<tp:taxon-name>Macroparalepis</tp:taxon-name>
recognized by 
Ege (1933
, 
1957
).
</p>
         <p>Rofen (1966)
provided a key to all 10 species recognized at that time, many of them based on juveniles and other data provided by 
Ege (1933
, 
1957
). Two species, 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis rothschildiRichards, 1967</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis siliquiventerPost, 1970</tp:taxon-name>
, were described subsequently to 
Rofen (1966)
.
</p>
         <p>Post (1982)
documented a specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
(
BMNH
1981.11.30.1, 
146.4 mm
SL, off eastern 
Java
) with the dorsal fin far posterior, its origin only slightly before the anal fin, a unique condition for paralepidids. He concluded that “ 
it might be that a backward progression of dorsal fin is part of ontogeny….Therefore, the value of dorsal fin position as an indicator of a specific difference seems doubtful.
” By contrast, the first author examined a large number of specimens, including the 
type
series of those species described by Ege, and found that the positions of the dorsal, pelvic and anal fins in the same taxon are quite stable in paralepidids, not shifting greatly in distance.
</p>
         <p>
Recently, 12 well-preserved specimens collected off the 
Philippines
(
Sulu
Sea) and one poorly preserved specimen collected from off northwestern 
Australia
(the latter collected together with 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
) were found in col- lections. These were identical to the description provided by 
Post (1982)
. A detailed examination on them showed they are distinct from 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
in having different body proportions and vertebral formula, and are therefore described herein as a new species.
</p>
         <p>
Seven specimens of another 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
species with many saddles on the dorsal and ventral margins of the body, were collected off northwestern 
Australia
, 
Myanmar
and 
Indonesia
during trawl surveys. These specimens differ from all congeners and were an undescribed species that closely resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
but differed in having many more blotches on the body, more vertebrae and different body proportions.
</p>
         <p>
In addition, a large number of specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
collected off Dongsha (Pratas) Islands, 
Australia
and West Indies were also examined. Together with the two new species described, these three are recognized as the 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
species complex in sharing several common characters.
</p>
         <p>
The purposes of the present study are to provide a redescription of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
based on newly collected specimens, to describe two new species, and to provide additional useful diagnostic characteristics for identifying all three species.

</p>
            <p>Distinguishing features.
A genus of the subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Paralepidinae</tp:taxon-name>
with body generally relatively slender; anus clearly situated before dorsal-fin origin; jaws slender; nostrils above posterior the end of maxilla (but unknown in some species because of a lack of adult specimens), and some are slightly further forward (i.e. three species treated in present study); ventral adipose fin well-developed between anus and origin of anal fin; anal-fin rays 34–50 (except 
<tp:taxon-name>S. molesta</tp:taxon-name>
with 30); vertebrae more than 84 (usually more than 90).

            <p>Remarks.
Prior to the present study, total of 12 nominal species were recognized in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
. The two new species described herein raise the number to 14. However, based on the examination of the 
type
specimens of most of species, some may be reassigned to other genera, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>Harry (1951
, 
1953
) listed many characters in his diagnosis of 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
. However, most of them are commonly shared by other genera. 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>Macroparalepis
Ege, 
1933</tp:taxon-name>
in having a very slender body, but 
<tp:taxon-name>Macroparalepis</tp:taxon-name>
has the anus well behind the tip of the anal fin, no ventral adipose fin and 24–28 anal-anal fin rays, whereas 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
has the anus just situated above posterior tip of pelvic fin, ventral adipose fin well-developed between anus and AFO, and more than 34 anal-fin rays (except for one species with 30).
</p>
            <p>
Of all the other genera in the Lestidiinae, 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>DolichosudisPost, 1969</tp:taxon-name>
. Based on observations by the first author, no distinguishable character has been found between these two genera, except for the uniformly blackish color in adults of 
<tp:taxon-name>Dolichosudis</tp:taxon-name>
, compared with an uneven color pattern, such as saddles, in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
. These two genera are likely to be synonyms.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
also shares most characters with members of 
<tp:taxon-name>LestidiopsHubbs, 1916</tp:taxon-name>
. The two genera can be separated mainly by body shape (much more slender and narrow in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
than in 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
), shapes of jaws (more slender in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
than in 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
), and position of nostrils (above or behind posterior end of maxilla in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
and well in front in 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
). However, the three species treated here have moderately slender bodies and jaws and their nostrils are slightly in front of the end of the maxilla, conditions that are “intermediate” between these of the two genera. Further studies are needed in order to assess the validity of the two genera, and the species assigned to them may change.

DFO about 1/4 SL before caudal fin, well behind VFO and midpoint of V–A. VFO well behind middle of body. Very small axial scale, mostly embedded, behind pelvic-fin base. Anal fin originating at about 1/5 SL before caudal fin.</p>
            <p>Premaxilla with 2 or 3 small canines, followed by row of many small, closely-spaced, fixed, retrose teeth along upper jaw, gradually smaller posteriorly. Vomerine teeth absent. Mandible with 3 depressible fangs at front, followed by two rows of large broadly-spaced teeth, forming 5–8 tooth pairs, those in inner row long, with knife-like tip, and depressible; those in outer row much shorter, recurved and fixed. Two rows of teeth on each palatine, anterior 5–7 forming widely-spaced tooth pairs, those in inner two depressible and long, those in outer row short and fixed, followed by single row of short and fixed teeth. Tongue fleshy, spatulate anteriorly, with two parallel longitudinal rows of teeth extending length of glossohyal, each row with several small teeth. Basihyal without teeth.</p>

<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
in having relatively few anal-fin rays (32–35, vs. 35 or more in other 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
, except for one species which has 30) and more blotches on dorsum anterior to DFO (5 or more, vs. 0–3). It differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
mainly in having 10 blotches on dorsum before DFO (vs. 
5 in<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
), 93–95 total vertebrae (vs. 89–92). The two species also differ in: head depth 3.9–4.6% SL (vs. 4.6–5.3% SL); predorsal length 71.8–73.6% SL (vs. 73.3–75.3% SL); D–A 6.8–8.7% SL (vs. 4.4–6.5% SL), dorsal-fin base 2.0–2.4% SL (vs. 2.8–3.1% SL); snout length 9.3–10.8% SL (vs. 10.7–11.6% SL); upper-jaw length 7.5–9.2% SL (vs. 9.6–10.8% SL); lower-jaw length 10.4–12.0% SL (vs. 12.8–13.5% SL); V–D 52.3–63.0% V–A (vs. 64.7–75.7% V–A) (see 
Table 1
). However, as only a few specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. multifasciata</tp:taxon-name>
were available, these ranges may increase and overlap, when more material is caught.
</p>
            <p>
The gill rakers in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. multifasciatus</tp:taxon-name>
are relatively weakly-developed (

) compared to the two other species in the complex (

). Ho &amp; Duhamel (2019) documented that the adults of some members in the subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Paralepidinae</tp:taxon-name>
had reduced jaw teeth and gill rakers. However, no member of Lestidiinae has been observed with reduction of teeth or gill rakers. Because all our specimens are relativly large (
248–280 mm
SL), and no small specimens were available, the condition of the gill rakers in juveniles awaits further investagation.

) somewhat rudimentary and not easy to observe without staining; well developed in outer the two arches and poorly developed on the two inner arches. Each raker with 2 or 3 (mainly 2) short teeth. First arch with 3 small rakers on epibranchial, 15 on ceratobranchial, and several on posterior half of hypobranchial, those on anterior half with their bases fused to each other (

). Single row of small teeth on fifth cerotobrachial. Four gill arches, filament present on the first to fourth arches. The fourth mostly connected to the gill wall by membrane. Pseudobranches present, inside a deep pocket above first gill arch.
</p>
            <p>Body devoid of scales, except for lateral-line scales originating from above pectoral girdle and running to above about posterior third of anal-fin base. Anterior lateral-line scales slightly wider than high, gradually becoming smaller and becoming narrower posteriorly; those in anterior half of lateral line with concave on upper and lower margins; each scale with 3 pores above and below the posterior portions, the anteriormost one largest; posterior scales with only 1 pore in general.</p>
            <p>No luminescent duct in abdominal cavity. Peritoneal sections well developed and clearly separated in adults.</p>
            <p>Coloration.
Fresh coloration translucent with similar, but much paler pigmentation than in preservation (

). Coloration of preserved specimens (

) with dorsal half of body generally brownish, with relatively large and scattered chromatophores and darker saddles consisting of numerous tiny and dense chromatophores. Ventral half of body mostly devoid of pigment, except for blotches similar to dorsal surface and a narrow stripe of chromatophores on submargin of abdominal ridge.
</p>
            <p>Anterior half of snout and lower jaw densely covered with chromatophores, somewhat blackish; other parts of head with unevenly and loosely scattered chromatophores. Top of head brownish. All fins blackish, except for pale pectoral fin sometimes with few chromatophores.</p>
            <p>Dorsal saddles alternating with ventral saddles before AFO. Eight saddles on dorsum, 4 before VFO, fifth slightly before midpoint of V–A, sixth just in front of DFO, 7th relatively wide, above about middle of anal fin base, posterior portion connected to 8th saddles of ventral margin, and last fused with ventral saddle, forming broad band.</p>
            <p>Nine saddles on ventral margin; 4 on abdomen before VFO, 5th at pelvic fin base; 6th at midpoint of V–A, 7th right at anterior quarter of anal-fin base, its base much longer than others; 8th right above posterior 1/3 of anal-fin base; and the last on caudal peduncle, fused with the last saddle of dorsum, forming a wide band.</p>
            <p>Peritoneal membranes divided into 11 sections, 1st at pectoral-fin base; 8 between pectoral and pelvic fins, 1 at pelvic fin base and 1 behind pelvic fin base.</p>
            <p>Size.
The largest specimen examined in this study is 
161 mm
SL.

               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
is unique for the family in having the dorsal fin originated far back, at about same vertical as AFO. It is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
in coloration, body proportions, and fin and vertebral formulae. Characters related to the backward position of dorsal fin are V–D = 96.3–105.3% V–A (vs. 64.3–73.1%); vertebrae before DFO 57–58 (vs. 50–53); lateral-line scales before DFO 56–68 (vs. 50–52); vertebrae between VFO and DFO 17–19 (vs. 9–12). It is notable that the predorsal length of both species are strongly over- lapped, but the preanal length is relatively short in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. retrodorsalis</tp:taxon-name>
(73.2–79.9% SL; vs. 79.1–80.0%), so that the position of the anal fin in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. retrodorsalis</tp:taxon-name>
is relatively forward compared to that of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
.

            <p>
Other useful characters that distinguish 
<tp:taxon-name>S. retrodorsalis</tp:taxon-name>
from 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
are smaller head, length 16.8– 19.1% (vs. 19.7–22.4% SL); larger eye, diameter 16.5–18.3% HL (vs. 12.7–15.5% HL), a broader interorbital width 11.7–13.0% (vs. 8.7–11.4% HL); a shorter snout, length 8.9–10.3% SL (vs. 11.2–11.6% SL) and 51.3–53.9% HL (vs. 53.5–57.5% HL); and both jaws relatively short, upper jaw 8.2–9.3% SL (vs. 9.9–10.8% SL) and lower jaw 11.1–12.0% SL (vs. 12.8–13.5% SL).

            <p>Distinguishing features.
A genus of the subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Paralepidinae</tp:taxon-name>
with body generally relatively slender; anus clearly situated before dorsal-fin origin; jaws slender; nostrils above posterior the end of maxilla (but unknown in some species because of a lack of adult specimens), and some are slightly further forward (i.e. three species treated in present study); ventral adipose fin well-developed between anus and origin of anal fin; anal-fin rays 34–50 (except 
<tp:taxon-name>S. molesta</tp:taxon-name>
with 30); vertebrae more than 84 (usually more than 90).

            <p>Remarks.
Prior to the present study, total of 12 nominal species were recognized in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
. The two new species described herein raise the number to 14. However, based on the examination of the 
type
specimens of most of species, some may be reassigned to other genera, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>Harry (1951
, 
1953
) listed many characters in his diagnosis of 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
. However, most of them are commonly shared by other genera. 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>Macroparalepis
Ege, 
1933</tp:taxon-name>
in having a very slender body, but 
<tp:taxon-name>Macroparalepis</tp:taxon-name>
has the anus well behind the tip of the anal fin, no ventral adipose fin and 24–28 anal-anal fin rays, whereas 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
has the anus just situated above posterior tip of pelvic fin, ventral adipose fin well-developed between anus and AFO, and more than 34 anal-fin rays (except for one species with 30).
</p>
            <p>
Of all the other genera in the Lestidiinae, 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>DolichosudisPost, 1969</tp:taxon-name>
. Based on observations by the first author, no distinguishable character has been found between these two genera, except for the uniformly blackish color in adults of 
<tp:taxon-name>Dolichosudis</tp:taxon-name>
, compared with an uneven color pattern, such as saddles, in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
. These two genera are likely to be synonyms.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
also shares most characters with members of 
<tp:taxon-name>LestidiopsHubbs, 1916</tp:taxon-name>
. The two genera can be separated mainly by body shape (much more slender and narrow in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
than in 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
), shapes of jaws (more slender in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
than in 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
), and position of nostrils (above or behind posterior end of maxilla in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
and well in front in 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
). However, the three species treated here have moderately slender bodies and jaws and their nostrils are slightly in front of the end of the maxilla, conditions that are “intermediate” between these of the two genera. Further studies are needed in order to assess the validity of the two genera, and the species assigned to them may change.

<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
in having relatively few anal-fin rays (32–35, vs. 35 or more in other 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
, except for one species which has 30) and more blotches on dorsum anterior to DFO (5 or more, vs. 0–3). It differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
mainly in having 10 blotches on dorsum before DFO (vs. 
5 in<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
), 93–95 total vertebrae (vs. 89–92). The two species also differ in: head depth 3.9–4.6% SL (vs. 4.6–5.3% SL); predorsal length 71.8–73.6% SL (vs. 73.3–75.3% SL); D–A 6.8–8.7% SL (vs. 4.4–6.5% SL), dorsal-fin base 2.0–2.4% SL (vs. 2.8–3.1% SL); snout length 9.3–10.8% SL (vs. 10.7–11.6% SL); upper-jaw length 7.5–9.2% SL (vs. 9.6–10.8% SL); lower-jaw length 10.4–12.0% SL (vs. 12.8–13.5% SL); V–D 52.3–63.0% V–A (vs. 64.7–75.7% V–A) (see 
Table 1
). However, as only a few specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. multifasciata</tp:taxon-name>
were available, these ranges may increase and overlap, when more material is caught.
</p>
            <p>
The gill rakers in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. multifasciatus</tp:taxon-name>
are relatively weakly-developed (

) compared to the two other species in the complex (

). Ho &amp; Duhamel (2019) documented that the adults of some members in the subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Paralepidinae</tp:taxon-name>
had reduced jaw teeth and gill rakers. However, no member of Lestidiinae has been observed with reduction of teeth or gill rakers. Because all our specimens are relativly large (
248–280 mm
SL), and no small specimens were available, the condition of the gill rakers in juveniles awaits further investagation.

It is notable that the predorsal length of both species are strongly over- lapped, but the preanal length is relatively short in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. retrodorsalis</tp:taxon-name>
(73.2–79.9% SL; vs. 79.1–80.0%), so that the position of the anal fin in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. retrodorsalis</tp:taxon-name>
is relatively forward compared to that of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
.

            <p>
Other useful characters that distinguish 
<tp:taxon-name>S. retrodorsalis</tp:taxon-name>
from 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
are smaller head, length 16.8– 19.1% (vs. 19.7–22.4% SL); larger eye, diameter 16.5–18.3% HL (vs. 12.7–15.5% HL), a broader interorbital width 11.7–13.0% (vs. 8.7–11.4% HL); a shorter snout, length 8.9–10.3% SL (vs. 11.2–11.6% SL) and 51.3–53.9% HL (vs. 53.5–57.5% HL); and both jaws relatively short, upper jaw 8.2–9.3% SL (vs. 9.9–10.8% SL) and lower jaw 11.1–12.0% SL (vs. 12.8–13.5% SL).

            <p>Distinguishing features.
A genus of the subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Paralepidinae</tp:taxon-name>
with body generally relatively slender; anus clearly situated before dorsal-fin origin; jaws slender; nostrils above posterior the end of maxilla (but unknown in some species because of a lack of adult specimens), and some are slightly further forward (i.e. three species treated in present study); ventral adipose fin well-developed between anus and origin of anal fin; anal-fin rays 34–50 (except 
<tp:taxon-name>S. molesta</tp:taxon-name>
with 30); vertebrae more than 84 (usually more than 90).

            <p>Remarks.
Prior to the present study, total of 12 nominal species were recognized in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
. The two new species described herein raise the number to 14. However, based on the examination of the 
type
specimens of most of species, some may be reassigned to other genera, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>Harry (1951
, 
1953
) listed many characters in his diagnosis of 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
. However, most of them are commonly shared by other genera. 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>Macroparalepis
Ege, 
1933</tp:taxon-name>
in having a very slender body, but 
<tp:taxon-name>Macroparalepis</tp:taxon-name>
has the anus well behind the tip of the anal fin, no ventral adipose fin and 24–28 anal-anal fin rays, whereas 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
has the anus just situated above posterior tip of pelvic fin, ventral adipose fin well-developed between anus and AFO, and more than 34 anal-fin rays (except for one species with 30).
</p>
            <p>
Of all the other genera in the Lestidiinae, 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>DolichosudisPost, 1969</tp:taxon-name>
. Based on observations by the first author, no distinguishable character has been found between these two genera, except for the uniformly blackish color in adults of 
<tp:taxon-name>Dolichosudis</tp:taxon-name>
, compared with an uneven color pattern, such as saddles, in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
. These two genera are likely to be synonyms.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
also shares most characters with members of 
<tp:taxon-name>LestidiopsHubbs, 1916</tp:taxon-name>
. The two genera can be separated mainly by body shape (much more slender and narrow in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
than in 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
), shapes of jaws (more slender in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
than in 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
), and position of nostrils (above or behind posterior end of maxilla in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
and well in front in 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
). However, the three species treated here have moderately slender bodies and jaws and their nostrils are slightly in front of the end of the maxilla, conditions that are “intermediate” between these of the two genera. Further studies are needed in order to assess the validity of the two genera, and the species assigned to them may change.

            <p>Body devoid of scales, except for single row of lateral-line scales originating above pectoral girdle and running to above about posterior third to fourth of anal-fin base. Lateral-line scales as high as wide, becoming gradually smaller and narrower posteriorly; a cluster of 3–5 pores on each side of scale, outermost pore largest.</p>
            <p>No luminescent duct in abdominal cavity. Peritoneal sections well-developed and separated in adults.</p>
            <p>Coloration.
Body translucent to light dusty when fresh, yellowish to grayish brown in preservation. Upper fourth of body covered with small chromatophores; lateral line densely covered with chromatophores, gradually becoming scattered on ventral half of body. Dense chromatophores on snout, both lips and abdominal ridge; scattered chromatophores on top of head, nape, and around eye. Very fine chromatophores forming large saddles on dorsum and ventral margin; 9 or 10 on dorsum, 5 before DFO, 1 at dorsal-fin base, 2 between dorsal and adipose fins, 1 or 2 on caudal peduncle; 8 saddles on ventral margin, 
3 in
front of VFO, 1 at pelvic-fin base, 1 near AFO, 1 on middle of anal-fin base and 1 or 2 on caudal peduncle; the last 2 or 3 pairs of dorsal and ventral saddles usually fused to each other at mid-flank. Peritoneal membranes divided into 9 to 11 (mostly 10) sections, visible through belly. Pectoral and pelvic fin transparent to slightly hyaline; upper half of dorsal fin black; posterior portion of anal-fin blackish; caudal fin black.

<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
in having relatively few anal-fin rays (32–35, vs. 35 or more in other 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
, except for one species which has 30) and more blotches on dorsum anterior to DFO (5 or more, vs. 0–3). It differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
mainly in having 10 blotches on dorsum before DFO (vs. 
5 in<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
), 93–95 total vertebrae (vs. 89–92). The two species also differ in: head depth 3.9–4.6% SL (vs. 4.6–5.3% SL); predorsal length 71.8–73.6% SL (vs. 73.3–75.3% SL); D–A 6.8–8.7% SL (vs. 4.4–6.5% SL), dorsal-fin base 2.0–2.4% SL (vs. 2.8–3.1% SL); snout length 9.3–10.8% SL (vs. 10.7–11.6% SL); upper-jaw length 7.5–9.2% SL (vs. 9.6–10.8% SL); lower-jaw length 10.4–12.0% SL (vs. 12.8–13.5% SL); V–D 52.3–63.0% V–A (vs. 64.7–75.7% V–A) (see 
Table 1
). However, as only a few specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. multifasciata</tp:taxon-name>
were available, these ranges may increase and overlap, when more material is caught.
</p>
            <p>
The gill rakers in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. multifasciatus</tp:taxon-name>
are relatively weakly-developed (

) compared to the two other species in the complex (

). Ho &amp; Duhamel (2019) documented that the adults of some members in the subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Paralepidinae</tp:taxon-name>
had reduced jaw teeth and gill rakers. However, no member of Lestidiinae has been observed with reduction of teeth or gill rakers. Because all our specimens are relativly large (
248–280 mm
SL), and no small specimens were available, the condition of the gill rakers in juveniles awaits further investagation.

is unique for the family in having the dorsal fin originated far back, at about same vertical as AFO. It is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
in coloration, body proportions, and fin and vertebral formulae. Characters related to the backward position of dorsal fin are V–D = 96.3–105.3% V–A (vs. 64.3–73.1%); vertebrae before DFO 57–58 (vs. 50–53); lateral-line scales before DFO 56–68 (vs. 50–52); vertebrae between VFO and DFO 17–19 (vs. 9–12). It is notable that the predorsal length of both species are strongly over- lapped, but the preanal length is relatively short in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. retrodorsalis</tp:taxon-name>
(73.2–79.9% SL; vs. 79.1–80.0%), so that the position of the anal fin in

</p>
            <p>Distinguishing features.
A genus of the subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Paralepidinae</tp:taxon-name>
with body generally relatively slender; anus clearly situated before dorsal-fin origin; jaws slender; nostrils above posterior the end of maxilla (but unknown in some species because of a lack of adult specimens), and some are slightly further forward (i.e. three species treated in present study); ventral adipose fin well-developed between anus and origin of anal fin; anal-fin rays 34–50 (except 
<tp:taxon-name>S. molesta</tp:taxon-name>
with 30); vertebrae more than 84 (usually more than 90).

            <p>Remarks.
Prior to the present study, total of 12 nominal species were recognized in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
. The two new species described herein raise the number to 14. However, based on the examination of the 
type
specimens of most of species, some may be reassigned to other genera, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>Harry (1951
, 
1953
) listed many characters in his diagnosis of 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
. However, most of them are commonly shared by other genera. 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>Macroparalepis
Ege, 
1933</tp:taxon-name>
in having a very slender body, but 
<tp:taxon-name>Macroparalepis</tp:taxon-name>
has the anus well behind the tip of the anal fin, no ventral adipose fin and 24–28 anal-anal fin rays, whereas 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
has the anus just situated above posterior tip of pelvic fin, ventral adipose fin well-developed between anus and AFO, and more than 34 anal-fin rays (except for one species with 30).
</p>
            <p>
Of all the other genera in the Lestidiinae, 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>DolichosudisPost, 1969</tp:taxon-name>
. Based on observations by the first author, no distinguishable character has been found between these two genera, except for the uniformly blackish color in adults of 
<tp:taxon-name>Dolichosudis</tp:taxon-name>
, compared with an uneven color pattern, such as saddles, in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
. These two genera are likely to be synonyms.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
also shares most characters with members of 
<tp:taxon-name>LestidiopsHubbs, 1916</tp:taxon-name>
. The two genera can be separated mainly by body shape (much more slender and narrow in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
than in 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
), shapes of jaws (more slender in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
than in 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
), and position of nostrils (above or behind posterior end of maxilla in 
<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>
and well in front in 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops</tp:taxon-name>
). However, the three species treated here have moderately slender bodies and jaws and their nostrils are slightly in front of the end of the maxilla, conditions that are “intermediate” between these of the two genera. Further studies are needed in order to assess the validity of the two genera, and the species assigned to them may change.

<tp:taxon-name>Stemonosudis</tp:taxon-name>

mainly in having 10 blotches on dorsum before DFO (vs. 
5 in<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
), 93–95 total vertebrae (vs. 89–92). The two species also differ in: head depth 3.9–4.6% SL (vs. 4.6–5.3% SL); predorsal length 71.8–73.6% SL (vs. 73.3–75.3% SL); D–A 6.8–8.7% SL (vs. 4.4–6.5% SL), dorsal-fin base 2.0–2.4% SL (vs. 2.8–3.1% SL); snout length 9.3–10.8% SL (vs. 10.7–11.6% SL); upper-jaw length 7.5–9.2% SL (vs. 9.6–10.8% SL); lower-jaw length 10.4–12.0% SL (vs. 12.8–13.5% SL); V–D 52.3–63.0% V–A (vs. 64.7–75.7% V–A) (see 
Table 1
). However, as only a few specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. multifasciata</tp:taxon-name>
were available, these ranges may increase and overlap, when more material is caught.
</p>
            <p>
The gill rakers in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. multifasciatus</tp:taxon-name>
are relatively weakly-developed (

) compared to the two other species in the complex (

). Ho &amp; Duhamel (2019) documented that the adults of some members in the subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Paralepidinae</tp:taxon-name>
had reduced jaw teeth and gill rakers. However, no member of Lestidiinae has been observed with reduction of teeth or gill rakers. Because all our specimens are relativly large (
248–280 mm
SL), and no small specimens were available, the condition of the gill rakers in juveniles awaits further investagation.

</p>
            <p>Anterior half of snout and lower jaw densely covered with chromatophores, somewhat blackish; other parts of head with unevenly and loosely scattered chromatophores. Top of head brownish. All fins blackish, except for pale pectoral fin sometimes with few chromatophores.</p>
            <p>Dorsal saddles alternating with ventral saddles before AFO. Eight saddles on dorsum, 4 before VFO, fifth slightly before midpoint of V–A, sixth just in front of DFO, 7th relatively wide, above about middle of anal fin base, posterior portion connected to 8th saddles of ventral margin, and last fused with ventral saddle, forming broad band.</p>
            <p>Nine saddles on ventral margin; 4 on abdomen before VFO, 5th at pelvic fin base; 6th at midpoint of V–A, 7th right at anterior quarter of anal-fin base, its base much longer than others; 8th right above posterior 1/3 of anal-fin base; and the last on caudal peduncle, fused with the last saddle of dorsum, forming a wide band.</p>

is unique for the family in having the dorsal fin originated far back, at about same vertical as AFO. It is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
in coloration, body proportions, and fin and vertebral formulae. Characters related to the backward position of dorsal fin are V–D = 96.3–105.3% V–A (vs. 64.3–73.1%); vertebrae before DFO 57–58 (vs. 50–53); lateral-line scales before DFO 56–68 (vs. 50–52); vertebrae between VFO and DFO 17–19 (vs. 9–12). It is notable that the predorsal length of both species are strongly over- lapped, but the preanal length is relatively short in 
<tp:taxon-name>S. retrodorsalis</tp:taxon-name>
(73.2–79.9% SL; vs. 79.1–80.0%), so that the position of the anal fin in

is relatively forward compared to that of 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
.

Other useful characters that distinguish 
<tp:taxon-name>S. retrodorsalis</tp:taxon-name>
from 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
are smaller head, length 16.8– 19.1% (vs. 19.7–22.4% SL); larger eye, diameter 16.5–18.3% HL (vs. 12.7–15.5% HL), a broader interorbital width 11.7–13.0% (vs. 8.7–11.4% HL); a shorter snout, length 8.9–10.3% SL (vs. 11.2–11.6% SL) and 51.3–53.9% HL (vs. 53.5–57.5% HL); and both jaws relatively short, upper jaw 8.2–9.3% SL (vs. 9.9–10.8% SL) and lower jaw 11.1–12.0% SL (vs. 12.8–13.5% SL).

All other paralepidids have the dorsal fin situated well in front of AFO, and only the three species treated herein and 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidium blanciKartha, 1971</tp:taxon-name>
(= 
<tp:taxon-name>Lestidiops blanci</tp:taxon-name>
) have their dorsal fin situated clearly behind mid-point of V–A, but the fin still distinctly before the AFO, except for 
<tp:taxon-name>S. retrodorsalis</tp:taxon-name>
. Another departure from the norm is 
<tp:taxon-name>Uncisudis posteropelvis</tp:taxon-name>Fukui
&amp; Ozawa, 2004

which has the pelvic fin situated well behind DFO and very closed to AFO.
</p>
         <p>
The first author has examined large numbers of specimens across most genera and species, and can confirmed that the position of dorsal, pelvic and anal fins remains fairly consistent in the same species across all size classes in all paralepidids. On that basis, the proposal by 
Post (1982)
that 
<tp:taxon-name>S. rothschildi</tp:taxon-name>
have a “ 
backward progression of dorsal fin
” is not supported and can be a valuable means of differentiating species.
