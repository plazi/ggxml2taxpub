A new species, 
<tp:taxon-name>Echiniscus madonnae</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, is described from moss samples collected in 
Peru
. So far it is the only species within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Echiniscus bigranulatus</tp:taxon-name>
group that does not have true pores in the dorsal plate cuticle. This paper contains also a redescription of 
<tp:taxon-name>Echiniscus bigranulatus
Richters
</tp:taxon-name>
and updated descriptions of 
<tp:taxon-name>Echiniscus ollantaytamboensis
Nickel

and 
<tp:taxon-name>Echiniscus ranzii
Ramazzotti. In
</tp:taxon-name>
this paper we also provide a 
SEM
analysis of the dorsal plate cuticle structure.

         <p>
The number of described tardigrade species is nearing one thousand (

Guidetti &amp; Bertolani 
2005
). Around 
15
% of all known species belong to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Echiniscus
Schultze
</tp:taxon-name>
which makes it currently the most species rich genus within the phylum.
</p>
         <p>
In this paper we provide a redescription of 
<tp:taxon-name>Echiniscus bigranulatus
Richters, 
1908</tp:taxon-name>
, updated descriptions on 
<tp:taxon-name>Echiniscus ollantaytamboensis

, 
2001</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Echiniscus ranzii

and a description of a new species 
<tp:taxon-name>Echiniscus madonnae</tp:taxon-name>

We have examined

material of 
<tp:taxon-name>E. madonnae</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>E. ollantaytamboensis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>E. ranzii</tp:taxon-name>
and 
neotype
material of 
<tp:taxon-name>E. bigranulatus</tp:taxon-name>
(detailed information on the examined specimens is provided in sections concerning the particular species). All species have been observed in Light Microscopes (LM): Phase Contrast Microscope (
PCM
) and Nomarski Differential Interference Contrast Microscope (DIC). All species except for 
<tp:taxon-name>E. ranzii</tp:taxon-name>
have been analysed using Scanning Electron Microscope (
SEM
). After the first 
SEM
session some specimens were delicately torn using a fine needle and then coated with platinum once again. This technique enabled a three dimensional observation of cuticle internal structure. Schemes of the cuticle sections were based on 
SEM
photomicrographs made using this technique.
</p>
         <p>All measurements are given in micrometers [µm]. Structures were measured only if they were undamaged and their orientation was suitable. Body length was measured from the anterior margin to the end of the body, excluding the hind legs. Only external claws were measured.</p>
         <p>
Microphotographs were made using and 
SEM
, 
PCM
and DIC.
</p>
         <p>Species descriptions are in alphabetical order.</p>

            <p>Redescription</p>
            <p>
Adult female (measurements of the 
neotype
): Body length 
202.4
(

). Body red. Red eyes visible in living specimens only. Internal cirrus 
13.8
long, external cirrus 
18.1
long; internal/external cirrus ratio = 
0.76
. Cephalic papilla 
7.6
long. Apart from head cirri and cirrus A no other appendices present. Cirrus A 
47.5
long, ending in a point. Cirrus A/body ratio = 
0.23
. Clava 
6.7
long.
</p>
            <p>
Dorsal (plate) cuticle with true pores and without granulation (

). Cuticle appearance in 
SEM
: surface smooth without granules, strongly porous. Pores large (1.0 in diameter) (

), smaller on the anterior portion of median plate II (
0.5 in
diameter).
</p>
            <p>
‘Sponge layer’ absent, large pillars present (

, 

). Undeveloped pillars in shape of blunt projections visible under pores. Cuticle visible in 
PCM
: pores visible as bright fields, cuticular pillars appear as dark dots. Pores on the same focus level as pillars (

). Both pores and cuticular pillars very well focusable. Ventral cuticle with very fine, dense and regular granulation.
</p>
            <p>
All plates well developed with the same sculpture, but anterior part of median plate II with smaller pores (
ca.0.5 in
diameter) (

). Head and scapular plates not faceted. In LM lateral portions of scapular plate seem to be detached from the dorsal plate and form small shoulder plates (one on each side of the body) divided from the scapular plate by a thin bright stripe. This false division is caused by a bend of plate where cuticle is thinner; in 
SEM
this division is not visible. Third median plate present and well developed (

). Terminal plate faceted. Notches 19.0 long.
</p>
            <p>
Spine on legs I in shape of narrow triangle, 
2.9
long. Papilla on legs IV finger­like, 
4.8
long (

). Dentate collar with fine granulation in LM (small, shallow depressions in

Plates well developed. Head and scapular plates not faceted. In LM lateral portions of scapular plate seem to be detached from the dorsal plate and form small shoulder plates (one on each side of the body) divided from the scapular plate by a thin bright stripe. This false division is caused by a bend of the plate where cuticle is thinner; in 
SEM
this division is not visible. Third median plate absent, area between second paired plates and terminal plate covered with granules which merge in anterior portion and form a narrow ridge (

Results of simple statistical analysis of measurements of selected morphological structures for

randomly chosen adult specimens are given in 

Table

, for all found juvenile specimens in 

Table

, and for all found larvae in

. One exuvium with three round eggs was found (eggs 
ca.

            <p>
The anterior portion of the second median plate is granulated in smaller individuals (

) and in larger specimens apart from the granules there are also pseudopores present (

).
</p>
            <p>
There are some discrepancies regarding the occurrence of the third median plate between the original description (

Nickel 
et al.2001
), photomicrographs in the original description and our observations on the 
type
material and specimens found in Puno. The authors of the description state that the third median plate is absent, however it can be noted on the photomicrographs which they provided in the paper. From our observations we conclude that larvae and juvenile specimens do not have the third median plate, but the area between the second paired plates and the terminal plate is covered with granules (

). In adults the third median plate is present (

), however in smaller specimens it may be not fully developed and limited to the anterior portion.
</p>
            <p>
The authors of the original description state also yellow colour of the body and that the body length varies between 180.0 and 275.0. In the population from Puno (including larvae) body length extremes are 
147.3
and 
467.4
. and colour was more reddish. These differences are probably due to different environmental conditions in which two population have lived.

Since we were able to examine only one

            <p>Redescription</p>
            <p>
Adult female (measurements of the 
neotype
): Body length 
202.4
(

). Body red. Red eyes visible in living specimens only. Internal cirrus 
13.8
long, external cirrus 
18.1
long; internal/external cirrus ratio = 
0.76
. Cephalic papilla 
7.6
long. Apart from head cirri and cirrus A no other appendices present. Cirrus A 
47.5
long, ending in a point. Cirrus A/body ratio = 
0.23
. Clava 
6.7
long.
</p>
            <p>
Dorsal (plate) cuticle with true pores and without granulation (

). Cuticle appearance in 
SEM
: surface smooth without granules, strongly porous. Pores large (1.0 in diameter) (

), smaller on the anterior portion of median plate II (
0.5 in
diameter).
</p>
            <p>
‘Sponge layer’ absent, large pillars present (

, 

). Undeveloped pillars in shape of blunt projections visible under pores. Cuticle visible in 
PCM
: pores visible as bright fields, cuticular pillars appear as dark dots. Pores on the same focus level as pillars (

). Both pores and cuticular pillars very well focusable. Ventral cuticle with very fine, dense and regular granulation.
</p>
            <p>
All plates well developed with the same sculpture, but anterior part of median plate II with smaller pores (
ca.0.5 in
diameter) (

). Head and scapular plates not faceted. In LM lateral portions of scapular plate seem to be detached from the dorsal plate and form small shoulder plates (one on each side of the body) divided from the scapular plate by a thin bright stripe. This false division is caused by a bend of plate where cuticle is thinner; in 
SEM
this division is not visible. Third median plate present and well developed (

). Terminal plate faceted. Notches 19.0 long.
</p>
            <p>
Spine on legs I in shape of narrow triangle, 
2.9
long. Papilla on legs IV finger­like, 
4.8
long (

). Dentate collar with fine granulation in LM (small, shallow depressions in 
SEM
), and with 
12
sharp, triangular teeth (

).
</p>
            <p>
Claws of legs IV 11.0 long. External claws of all legs without spurs, internal claws of all legs with spur, directed downwards, growing out of claw at 
ca.35
o (

). Spur on claws of legs IV relatively large (
2.7
long; spur/claw ratio = 
0.25
). Claws of legs I–III slightly shorter.

            <p>
All of the specimens found across South and Central

are very similar, therefore we have assumed that the intraspecific variability in

is low.
</p>
            <p>According to the original description claws are devoid of the spurs, while all specimens that we have examined had spurs on internal claws of all legs. We think that spurs could have been overlooked, due to a relatively low angle in which they grow out of the claw. Sometimes, when claws are very closely arranged to each other, spurs are difficult to identify.</p>

Dorsal (plate) cuticle with pseudopores (hollows) and with true granulation (

). Granules (true granulation, on cuticle surface) present between scapular and first paired plates, on stripes in anterior portions of paired plates, in anterior part of second median plate, and between second paired plates and terminal plate (

). Granules variable in size (
0.5–1.5 in
diameter). Cuticle appearance in 
SEM
: pseudopores large (1.0 in diameter) and up to 1.0 deep (

, 

). ‘Sponge layer’ very well developed, small pillars present (

, 

). Cuticle visible in 
PCM
: Pseudopores visible as bright, unfocusable fields; when focusing down through cuticle cuticular pillars appear as small dark focusable dots (

). Ventral cuticle with very fine, dense and regular granulation. This granulation is caused by dense cuticular pillars (

).
</p>
            <p>
Plates well developed. Head and scapular plates not faceted. In LM lateral portions of scapular plate seem to be detached from the dorsal plate and form small shoulder plates (one on each side of the body) divided from the scapular plate by a thin bright stripe. This false division is caused by a bend of the plate where cuticle is thinner; in 
SEM
this division is not visible. Third median plate absent, area between second paired plates and terminal plate covered with granules which merge in anterior portion and form a narrow ridge (

). Terminal plate faceted. Notches 
21.9
long.

Spine on legs I in shape of narrow triangle, 
4.3
long. Papilla on legs IV finger­like,

Results of simple statistical analysis of measurements of selected morphological structures for 
24
randomly chosen adult specimens are given in 

Table

and for all found juvenile specimens in 

Table

            <p>
The third median plate is never present in juvenile specimens, but area between the second paired plates and terminal plate is covered with granules. In most adults third median plate is also absent, however in larger specimens granules tend to merge (usually in the area close to the second paired plates and/or close to the terminal plate) and form a ridge/two ridges which could be classified as a partially developed third median plate (

).

): body length 
375.3
(

14.3
long, external cirrus 
41.8
long; internal/external cirrus ratio = 
0.34
. Cephalic papilla 
9.5

87.4
long, ending in a point. Cirrus A/body ratio =

9.5
long.
</p>
            <p>
Dorsal (plate) cuticle with true pores, pseudopores (hollows) and with true granulation (

). Granules (true granulation, on cuticle surface) present between scapular and first paired plate (small granules, 
ca.0.3–0.5 in
diameter), on stripes in anterior portions of paired plates, in anterior part of second median plate, and between third median plate and terminal plate (larger granules, 
ca.0.5–1.5 in
diameter). Granules often connected by strips of cuticle, so spaces between granules and stripes form shallow pseudopores (hollows) (

, 

). Granulated areas change smoothly into areas with pores and pillars (

, 

). Cuticle appearance in 
SEM
: pores large (1.0–2.0 in diameter) (

). ‘Sponge layer’ narrow, large pillars present (

, 

). Cuticle visible in 
PCM
: Pores and pseudopores visible as bright, fields; when focusing down through cuticle, cuticular pillars appear as dark dots (

). Pores, pseudopores and cuticular pillars very well focusable. Ventral cuticle with very fine, dense and regular granulation.
</p>
            <p>
All plates well developed. Head and scapular plates not faceted. In LM lateral portions of scapular plate seem to be detached from the dorsal plate and form small shoulder plates (one on each side of the body) divided from the scapular plate by a thin bright stripe. This false division is caused by a bend of the plate where cuticle is thinner; in 
SEM
this division is not visible. Third median plate present and developed anteriorly (

). Terminal plate faceted. Notches 
23.8
long.
</p>
            <p>
Spine on legs I in shape of short triangle, 
4.8
long. Papilla on legs IV finger­like, 
5.7
long (

). Dentate collar with fine granulation and faint pseudopores in LM (small, shallow pseudopores in 
SEM
), and with 
9
sharp, triangular teeth with wide bases (

).
</p>
            <p>
Claws of legs IV 
24.7
long. External claws of all legs without spurs, internal claws of all legs with a relatively small spur, curved downwards, growing out of claw at 
ca.90
o (

). Spur on claws of legs IV 
2.9
long; spur/claw ratio = 
0.12
. Claws of legs I– III slightly shorter.

            <p>Remarks</p>
            <p>
Results of simple statistical analysis of measurements of selected morphological structures for 
13
randomly chosen adult specimens are given in 

Table 
4
, for all found juvenile specimens in 

Table 
5
, and for all found larvae in 

Table 
6
. One exuvium with three round eggs was found (eggs 
ca.
100.0 in diameter).
</p>
            <p>
The anterior portion of the second median plate is granulated in smaller individuals (

) and in larger specimens apart from the granules there are also pseudopores present (

).
</p>
            <p>
There are some discrepancies regarding the occurrence of the third median plate between the original description (

Nickel 
et al.2001
), photomicrographs in the original description and our observations on the 
type
material and specimens found in Puno. The authors of the description state that the third median plate is absent, however it can be noted on the photomicrographs which they provided in the paper. From our observations we conclude that larvae and juvenile specimens do not have the third median plate, but the area between the second paired plates and the terminal plate is covered with granules (

). In adults the third median plate is present (

), however in smaller specimens it may be not fully developed and limited to the anterior portion.
</p>
            <p>
The authors of the original description state also yellow colour of the body and that the body length varies between 180.0 and 275.0. In the population from Puno (including larvae) body length extremes are 
147.3
and 
467.4
. and colour was more reddish. These differences are probably due to different environmental conditions in which two population have lived.

            <p>Remarks</p>
            <p>
Since we were able to examine only one 
syntype
and the original description was written forty years ago, the description of this species is relatively poor in comparison to other species within the 
<tp:taxon-name>bigranulatus</tp:taxon-name>
group. However a set of characters makes this species very easily recognisable among other known members of the group (
e.g.
, a very high Cirrus 
A
/body ratio and the presence of spurs on external claws).

            <p>
Adult female (measurements of the 
neotype
): Body length 
202.4
(

). Body red. Red eyes visible in living specimens only. Internal cirrus 
13.8
long, external cirrus 
18.1
long; internal/external cirrus ratio = 
0.76
. Cephalic papilla 
7.6
long. Apart from head cirri and cirrus A no other appendices present. Cirrus A 
47.5
long, ending in a point. Cirrus A/body ratio = 
0.23
. Clava 
6.7
long.
</p>
            <p>
Dorsal (plate) cuticle with true pores and without granulation (

). Cuticle appearance in 
SEM
: surface smooth without granules, strongly porous. Pores large (1.0 in diameter) (

), smaller on the anterior portion of median plate II (
0.5 in
diameter).
</p>
            <p>
‘Sponge layer’ absent, large pillars present (

, 

). Undeveloped pillars in shape of blunt projections visible under pores. Cuticle visible in 
PCM
: pores visible as bright fields, cuticular pillars appear as dark dots. Pores on the same focus level as pillars (

). Both pores and cuticular pillars very well focusable. Ventral cuticle with very fine, dense and regular granulation.
</p>
            <p>
All plates well developed with the same sculpture, but anterior part of median plate II with smaller pores (
ca.0.5 in
diameter) (

). Head and scapular plates not faceted. In LM lateral portions of scapular plate seem to be detached from the dorsal plate and form small shoulder plates (one on each side of the body) divided from the scapular plate by a thin bright stripe. This false division is caused by a bend of plate where cuticle is thinner; in 
SEM
this division is not visible. Third median plate present and well developed (

). Terminal plate faceted. Notches 19.0 long.
</p>
            <p>
Spine on legs I in shape of narrow triangle, 
2.9
long. Papilla on legs IV finger­like, 
4.8
long (

). Dentate collar with fine granulation in LM (small, shallow depressions in 
SEM
), and with 
12
sharp, triangular teeth (

).
</p>
            <p>
Claws of legs IV 11.0 long. External claws of all legs without spurs, internal claws of all legs with spur, directed downwards, growing out of claw at 
ca.35
o (

). Spur on claws of legs IV relatively large (
2.7

</p>
            <p>According to the original description claws are devoid of the spurs, while all specimens that we have examined had spurs on internal claws of all legs. We think that spurs could have been overlooked, due to a relatively low angle in which they grow out of the claw.

ca.0.3–0.5 in
diameter), on stripes in anterior portions of paired plates, in anterior part of second median plate, and between third median plate and terminal plate (larger granules, 
ca.0.5–1.5 in
diameter). Granules often connected by strips of cuticle, so spaces between granules and stripes form shallow pseudopores (hollows) (

, 

). Granulated areas change smoothly into areas with pores and pillars (

, 

). Cuticle appearance in 
SEM
: pores large (1.0–2.0 in diameter) (

            <p>
Results of simple statistical analysis of measurements of selected morphological structures for 
13
randomly chosen adult specimens are given in 

Table 
4
, for all found juvenile specimens in 

Table 
5
, and for all found larvae in 

Table

. One exuvium with three round eggs was found (eggs 
ca.
100.0 in diameter).
</p>
            <p>
The anterior portion of the second median plate is granulated in smaller individuals (

) and in larger specimens apart from the granules there are also pseudopores present (

).
</p>
            <p>
There are some discrepancies regarding the occurrence of the third median plate between the original description (

Nickel 
et al.2001
), photomicrographs in the original description and our observations on the 
type
material and specimens found in Puno. The authors of the description state that the third median plate is absent, however it can be noted on the photomicrographs which they provided in the paper. From our observations we conclude that larvae and juvenile specimens do not have the third median plate, but the area between the second paired plates and the terminal plate is covered with granules (

). In adults the third median plate is present (

), however in smaller specimens it may be not fully developed and limited to the anterior portion.
</p>
            <p>
The authors of the original description state also yellow colour of the body and that the body length varies between 180.0 and 275.0. In the population from Puno (including larvae) body length extremes are 
147.3
and 
467.4
. and colour was more reddish. These differences are probably due to different environmental conditions in which two population have lived.

            <p>Remarks</p>
            <p>
Since we were able to examine only one 
syntype
and the original description was written forty years ago, the description of this species is relatively poor in comparison to other species within the 
<tp:taxon-name>bigranulatus</tp:taxon-name>
group. However a set of characters makes this species very easily recognisable among other known members of the group (
e.g.
, a very high Cirrus 
A
/body ratio and the presence of spurs on external claws).

13.8
long, external cirrus 
18.1
long; internal/external cirrus ratio =

            <p>
Dorsal (plate) cuticle with true pores and without granulation (

). Cuticle appearance in 
SEM
: surface smooth without granules, strongly porous. Pores large (1.0 in diameter) (

), smaller on the anterior portion of median plate II (
0.5 in
diameter).
</p>
            <p>
‘Sponge layer’ absent, large pillars present (

, 

). Undeveloped pillars in shape of blunt projections visible under pores. Cuticle visible in 
PCM
: pores visible as bright fields, cuticular pillars appear as dark dots. Pores on the same focus level as pillars (

). Both pores and cuticular pillars very well focusable. Ventral cuticle with very fine, dense and regular granulation.
</p>
            <p>
All plates well developed with the same sculpture, but anterior part of median plate II with smaller pores (
ca.0.5 in
diameter) (

). Head and scapular plates not faceted. In LM lateral portions of scapular plate seem to be detached from the dorsal plate and form small shoulder plates (one on each side of the body) divided from the scapular plate by a thin bright stripe. This false division is caused by a bend of plate where cuticle is thinner; in 
SEM
this division is not visible. Third median plate present and well developed (

). Terminal plate faceted. Notches 19.0 long.
</p>
            <p>
Spine on legs I in shape of narrow triangle, 
2.9
long. Papilla on legs IV finger­like, 
4.8
long (

). Dentate collar with fine granulation in LM (small, shallow depressions in 
SEM
), and with 
12
sharp, triangular teeth (

).
</p>
            <p>
Claws of legs IV 11.0 long. External claws of all legs without spurs, internal claws of all legs with spur, directed downwards, growing out of claw at 
ca.35
o (

). Spur on claws of legs IV relatively large (

</p>
            <p>According to the original description claws are devoid of the spurs, while all specimens that we have examined had spurs on internal claws of all legs. We think that spurs could have been overlooked, due to a relatively low angle in which they grow out of the claw.

randomly chosen adult specimens are given in 

Table

, for all found juvenile specimens in 

Table

. One exuvium with three round eggs was found (eggs

            <p>
The anterior portion of the second median plate is granulated in smaller individuals (

) and in larger specimens apart from the granules there are also pseudopores present (

).
</p>
            <p>
There are some discrepancies regarding the occurrence of the third median plate between the original description (

Nickel 
et al.2001
), photomicrographs in the original description and our observations on the 
type
material and specimens found in Puno. The authors of the description state that the third median plate is absent, however it can be noted on the photomicrographs which they provided in the paper. From our observations we conclude that larvae and juvenile specimens do not have the third median plate, but the area between the second paired plates and the terminal plate is covered with granules (

). In adults the third median plate is present (

), however in smaller specimens it may be not fully developed and limited to the anterior portion.
</p>
            <p>
The authors of the original description state also yellow colour of the body and that the body length varies between 180.0 and 275.0. In the population from Puno (including larvae) body length extremes are 
147.3
and 
467.4
. and colour was more reddish. These differences are probably due to different environmental conditions in which two population have lived.

The 
<tp:taxon-name>Echiniscus bigranulatus</tp:taxon-name>
group can be characterised as follows: terrestrial species with ‘double granulation’ on most of the dorsal plates, besides head appendages and lateral cirri 
A
lacking any other appendages, yellow­red body colour, inhabiting South and Central 
America
. 
SEM
observations concluded that the term ‘double granulation’ is not appropriate to describe the sculpture of known species within the group, since the characteristic appearance of the cuticle in LM is caused by the co­presence of pores (or pseudopores) and cuticular pillars (see 

).
