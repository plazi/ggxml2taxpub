Our understanding of the earliest stages of crown bird evolution is hindered by an 
exceedingly sparse avian fossil record from the Mesozoic era. The most ancient
phylogenetic divergences among crown birds are known to have occurred in the 
Cretaceous period1
– 
3, but stem-lineage representatives of the deepest subclades ofcrown birds—Palaeognathae (ostriches and kin), Galloanserae (landfowl andwaterfowl) and Neoaves (all other extant birds)—are unknown from the Mesozoic era.As a result, key questions related to the ecology4

5, biogeography3

7and divergencetimes1

– 
10of ancestral crown birds remain unanswered. Here we report a newMesozoic fossil that occupies a position close to the last common ancestor ofGalloanserae and fills a key phylogenetic gap in the early evolutionary history ofcrown birds10

, from the Maastrichtian
age of Belgium (66.8–66.7 million years ago), is represented by a nearly complete,three-dimensionally preserved skull and associated postcranial elements. The fossilrepresents one of the only well-supported crown birds from the Mesozoic era12, and isthe first Mesozoic crown bird with well-represented cranial remains.<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornismaastrichtensis</tp:taxon-name>exhibits a previously undocumented combination of galliform(landfowl)-like and anseriform (waterfowl)-like features, and its presence alongside apreviously reportedIchthyornis-like taxon from the same locality13provides directevidence of the co-occurrence of crown birds and avialan stem birds. Its occurrence inthe Northern Hemisphere challenges biogeographical hypotheses of a Gondwananorigin of crown birds3, and its relatively small size and possible littoral ecology maycorroborate proposed ecological filters4

that influenced the persistence of crown birds through the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. By any measure,crown birds (
<tp:taxon-name>Neornithes</tp:taxon-name>
) are among the most diverse and conspicuous of the extant tetrapods,yet their early evolutionary history is poorly understood. Apart from birds,all major groups of extant tetrapods—lissamphibians 
14, squamates15, turtles16, mammals17
and crocodylians 
18
—are well-known from pre-Cenozoic crown-group fossils. By contrast, the Mesozoic record of well-supported crown birds is restricted to a single latest Maastrichtian taxon, 
Vegavis iaai12
. Several fragmentary Mesozoic fossils have at times been referred to 
<tp:taxon-name>Neornithes</tp:taxon-name>19, although the justifications for such assignments arequestionable and these records have not unambiguously withstoodre-evaluation20
, 
21.</p>
      <p>We report a new crown bird from the Late Cretaceous of Belgium.
The fossil is between 66.8 and 66.7 million years old—making it the oldest unambiguous crown bird fossil yet discovered—and provides important insight into the extent of Mesozoic neornithine diversifica- tion before the end-Cretaceous mass-extinction event,66.02 million 
years ago (Ma)22. Uniquely among crown birds from the Mesozoic andearliest Palaeocene, the new fossil includes a nearly complete, three-
dimensionally preserved skull,yielding direct insights into the nature of the crown bird skull early in neornithine evolutionary history.The 

specimen exhibits a previously unseen combination of features that are diagnostic of 
<tp:taxon-name>Galliformes</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Anseriformes</tp:taxon-name>
,which together form the crown cladeGalloanserae—one of the most deeply diverging clades of
crown birds and the sister group to the hyperdiverse extant clade Neo-<tp:taxon-name>aves</tp:taxon-name>1
– 
3. Our most parsimonious phylogenetic hypothesis suggests that the fossil sits on the stem lineage of Galloanserae,which would makeit the only stem galloanseran yet known and would fill a conspicuous phylogenetic gap in the neornithine fossil record.</p>

Most major cranial components are in their original anatomical positions.The general appearance of the premaxillary beak resembles that of extant 
<tp:taxon-name>Galliformes</tp:taxon-name>
,particularly in its gently down-curved tip and delicate construction,with no ossified joints among the rostral components
26. The contralateral frontal processes of the premaxillae are unfused along their length,and the premaxillae and nasals are unfused at both their tomial and narial contacts. The beak tip is unhooked, which distinguishes<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>
from most Galloanserae except certain 
<tp:taxon-name>Anatidae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Presbyornithidae</tp:taxon-name>

</p>
            <p>
The skull lacks a distinct nasofrontal hinge.As such,the architecture of this region more closely resembles that of extant 
<tp:taxon-name>Galliformes</tp:taxon-name>
than 
<tp:taxon-name>Anseriformes</tp:taxon-name>

            <p>The left quadrate is well-preserved in three dimensions and is generally similar to the quadrate of the fossil pan-anseriform<tp:taxon-name>Presbyornis</tp:taxon-name>27</p>
            <p>
(

, Extended Data 

). The prootic and squamosal heads are divided by a well-developed incisure,as in almost all Neognathae;this contrasts with the condition in crownward stem birds such as
Ichthyornis
, 
in which the division between these condyles is poorly marked,and Palaeognathae,in which the condyles merge into a single head.Two pneumatic foramina pierce the quadrate:the foramen pneumaticum rostromediale and the foramen pneumaticum basiorbitale.A tuberculum subcapitulare is moderately developed on the lateral face of the otic process.This characteristic has been considered a derived feature of Galloanserae27; however,it is present in many Neoaves,and given its absence in Palaeognathae andIchthyornisit might instead represent a synapomorphy of Neognathae.The cotyla quadratojugalis of the quadrate is fairly deep,with a complete,un-notched rim.The pterygoid articulation is more widely separated dorsally from the mandibular condyle than in most extant Galloanserae,and is very similar to that of<tp:taxon-name>Presbyornis</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>As in all known Galloanserae,the mandible of<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>exhibits two cotylae for articulation with the bicondylar quadrate and a bladelike retroarticular process.This process is strongly hooked,and in its shape and proportions bears a strong resemblance to the condition in the pan-anseriformAnatalavis oxfordi
(

, Extended Data 

). An elongate,slightly dorsally oriented processus medialis is preserved on the right jaw,as in all Galloanserae.
</p>
            <p>The left distal femur is well-preserved,exhibiting a medial condyle with a bluntly angular profile between the articular surface of the condyle and its cranial margin. A detailed anatomical description of the skull and postcranium is provided in the Supplementary Information.</p>

29
(

Protodontopteryx30, and revised the scorings for several taxa,includingAnatalavis
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Presbyornis</tp:taxon-name>andConflicto
. 
Our analyses were uniformly consistent with a position of<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>near the last common ancestor of Galloanserae.Under parsimony we recovered a single most parsimonious tree with<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>as the sister taxon to crown Galloanserae,and analyses under a tip-dated Bayesian framework recovered<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>as the stemward-most pan-galliform.We are cautious in the interpretation of this result because few unambiguous synapomorphies can be optimized in support of a sister group relationship between<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Galliformes</tp:taxon-name>
to the exclusion of 
<tp:taxon-name>Anseriformes</tp:taxon-name>
. The few potential synapomorphies for such a clade that are observable in
<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>also occur in early pan-anseriforms such asConflicto(see Methods and Supplementary Information).Likewise,only one or two steps are required to move<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>to an alternate placement as a stem anseriform or stem galliform,respectively,in the parsimony analysis.The difficulty in resolving the precise placement of the fossil, as well as its notable combination of anseriform- and galliform-like anatomical features, is consistent with<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>occupying a short phylogenetic branch proximal to the most recent common ancestor of Galloanserae—one of the deepest nodes in the neornithine tree of life31.</p>

         <p>The latest Cretaceous fossil record of crown birds is extremely sparse.</p>
         <p>
Other than 
<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis
, 
Vegavis iaai</tp:taxon-name>(dated to around 66.5 Ma32) is the only Cretaceous neornithine known from a partial skeleton to have been thoroughly examined12. However, its phylogenetic position is debated33—studies have suggested variable positions within Neognathae12

– 
35
and even outside 
<tp:taxon-name>Neornithes</tp:taxon-name>36—emphasizing the importance of obtaining new information onVegavisand Mesozoic crown birds in general. Under parsimony,we recoveredVegavis
as the sister taxon to 
<tp:taxon-name>Neornithes</tp:taxon-name>
(that is,the crownward-most stem bird),whereas under a Bayesian framework
Vegaviswas recovered in an unresolved position at the base of Neognathae.</p>
         <p>Galloanseran cranial anatomy</p>
         <p>All discernible character evidence is consistent with neornithine (crown</p>
         <p>
bird) affinities for 
<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>
, 

and supports its hierarchical placement within 
<tp:taxon-name>Neornithes</tp:taxon-name>
(local synapomorphies such as a toothless beak;no coronoid bone;a bony mandibular symphysis), crown Neognathae (for example, palatine–premaxilla contact;an incisure between the prootic and squamosal cotylae of the quadrate) and Pangalloanserae (for example,a dorsoventrally deep and lateromedially compressed maxillary process of the premaxilla;palatines that are long, thin and widely separated rostrally;a bicondylar mandibular process of the quadrate;a long, dorsally oriented internal articular process of the mandible;a retroarticular process that is long, curving and strongly compressed lateromedially)

). Given the scarcity of threedimensional skulls from the earliest stages of the crown bird radiation,
<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>provides a key reference point for understanding how the marked variability of the crown bird skull came to be, and will inform estimates of early neornithine cranial disparity and rates of phenotypic evolution40
, 
41.</p>
         <p>With the exception of the autapomorphic morphology of the posterior nasals,almost none of the discernible cranial anatomy of<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>
falls outside of the range of variation that is exhibited by extant galloanserans,despite the widely differing cranial morphology of extant 
<tp:taxon-name>Galliformes</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Anseriformes</tp:taxon-name>26. Although galloanseran monophyly is now widely accepted(and was first suggested on the basis of basicranial morphology as early as the mid-nineteenth century42), the validity of this clade has been questioned26
, 
43,with some authors listing numerous anatomical dissimilarities between these groups26.Notably,<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>
reveals a previously undocumented combination of ‘galliform’ features,such as weakly fused rostral elements and rostrally forked nasals, and ‘anseriform’ features,such as a rostrally projecting postorbital process and a tall and strongly hooked retroarticular process (

, Extended Data 

)—revealing the plesiomorphic condition of the galloanseran skull.The fact that such distinctive features of extant galloanseran anatomy are observable in this approximately66.7-millionyear-old fossil corroborates the hypothesis of beak shape canalization arising early in,or predating,crown bird evolutionary history
44
, 
45, emphasizing the modular nature of the skull and bill of crown birds40.</p>
         <p>
Biogeography and the origin of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neornithes</tp:taxon-name>
         </p>
         <p>Much of the species-level and higher clade diversity of extant birds is confined to vestiges of Gondwana,which suggests that crown birds originated in the Southern Hemisphere3
. Reports of Mesozoic crown 
<p>
birds in Antarctica appear to support this hypothesis 
12
, 
34. However,the Palaeogene fossil record provides many examples of crown bird fossils that are well outside of the ranges of their closest extant relatives6
, 
21
, 
46
, 
47, which casts some doubt on the hypothesis of a Gondwanan cradle for crown bird evolution and suggests that factors such as Cenozoic climate shifts may have overprinted ancestral neornithine biogeographical patterns7
, 
48. As the oldest and one of the most deeply diverging crown birds yet identified,<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>
provides conclusive Mesozoic evidence of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neornithes</tp:taxon-name>
in the Northern Hemisphere,emphasizing that the discovery of further Mesozoic fossils will be necessary to convincingly identify the neornithine centre of origin.
</p>
         </p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>provides a firm calibration point for the minimum age of divergence of the major bird clades Galloanserae and Neoaves.We recommend that a minimum age of66.7 million years is assigned to this pivotal neornithine node in future divergence time studies,reflecting the youngest possible age of the<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>holotype including geochronological uncertainty.The paucity of crown bird remains from the Mesozoic is such that our current understanding of the deepest stages of the neornithine evolutionary timescale depends on the outcome of molecular divergence time analyses9. However,molecular-clock-based estimates for the deepest divergences of crown birds differ markedly depending on factors such as node calibration decisions and alternative parameterizations of statistical probability distributions8
, 
10. Furthermore, such estimates could be affected by the interplay of nucleotide substitution rates and deep-time directional selectivity on life history variables and body size, leading to disagreement as to the extent of neornithine survivorship across the end-Cretaceous mass-extinction event8
– 
10. We suggest that the terminal-Cretaceous age and rootward phylogenetic position of<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>are consistent with a limited diversification of crown birds in the Late Cretaceous, and restricted survivorship of crown birds across the end-Cretaceous mass-extinction event.This interpretation is in line with the emerging consensus from molecular divergence time studies1
, 
2
, 
8
– 
10, as well as evidence for a mass extinction of stem birds at the K–Pg boundary20. Furthermore, the oldest credible occurrences of crown birds in both the Northern(this study) and Southern Hemispheres12derive from terminal Mesozoic sediments,which might confirm the recently proposed null expectation of a rapid evolutionary transition between stem birds and crown birds31. The occurrence of a largeIchthyornis-like avialan13from the same horizon and quarry as the<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>holotype (with temporal separation amounting to no more than tens of thousands of years;see Supplementary Information) provides evidence of crown birds and avialan stem birds occurring in the same environment in the immediate lead-up to the K–Pg mass extinction.</p>
         <p>Considerable discussion has focused on hypothetical scenarios of neornithine survivorship across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction4. A consensus hypothesis is emerging in which survivors are thought to have exhibited a suite of features that proved selectively beneficial through the extinction event,including a relatively small body size to limit total metabolic requirements9, flying ability and a non-arboreal ecology4
, 
11; an advanced digestive system49; and dietary flexibility to capitalize on sparse resources that might have included insects and seeds5. However, owing to the scarcity of latest Cretaceous and earliest Palaeocene neornithine fossils,little direct fossil evidence can be applied to this question.<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>could therefore provide the best direct insight into the probable biology of neornithine K–Pg survivors, and—notably—no discernible aspects of its palaeobiology are inconsistent with these hypothetical expectations. Indeed, its relatively small size (less than50% of the median body size of known latest Maastrichtian avialans9
), narrow and elongate hindlimbs (Supplementary 
<p>
Information)and provenance from nearshore marine sediments might indicate a littoral ecology,which could validate an ecological—though not a phylogenetic—prediction of the hypothesis of ‘shorebird’-like origins for much of crown bird diversity 
50.</p>
         </p>
         <p>Fossils that clarify the Mesozoic origins of the extant bird radiation are among the rarest and most sought-after palaeontological discoveries.<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>helps to fill a phylogenetic and stratigraphic gap between the most crownward-known stem birds and the rich Cenozoic neornithine fossil record.This record of a Mesozoic neornithine from Europe provides key insights into the origin of extant bird diversity, and shows that future discoveries of even earlier Cretaceous neornithines could be as likely to derive from the Northern as the Sourthern Hemisphere.</p>

         <p>Preparation and imaging of specimens</p>
         <p>Owing to the fragility of the<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>holotype,only minor mechanical preparation was performed to reduce the volume of rock matrix for improved computed tomography(CT)scans.Scans of NHMM 2013 008, UW<tp:taxon-name>Presbyornis</tp:taxon-name>specimens and all extant taxa were performed at the Cambridge Biotomography Centre (CBC).<tp:taxon-name>Presbyornis</tp:taxon-name>UMNH.VP.29030 and UMNH.VP.29031 were scanned at the small-animal-imaging core research facilities of the University of Utah Health Science Cores.Anatalavis oxfordiNHMUK PV A5922 was scanned at the Natural History Museum London.All scanned material was digitally segmented and rendered using VGStudio Max 3.3.0. Full CT scanning details are provided in the Supplementary Information.</p>
         <p>Phylogenetic analyses</p>
         <p>To assess the phylogenetic position of<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>
, 
we scored it into a considerably modified version of a recent phylogenetic matrix that targets deep neornithine divergences and focuses on Galloanserae29, which in turn was modified from a previous study28. We also added the crownward stem birdIchthyornis disparas an outgroup taxon to improve the inference of character polarity at the base of crown birds,on the basis of direct examination of specimens and previously published literature51,52. We scored the stem galliform<tp:taxon-name>Gallinuloides wyomingensis</tp:taxon-name>through direct examination and reference to published descriptions53,54, and scored the pelagornithidsProtodontopteryx ruthae30and<tp:taxon-name>Pelagornis chilensis</tp:taxon-name>55
on the basis of published literature. The phylogenetic position of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelagornithidae</tp:taxon-name>
is debated,and they have been posited as early-diverging pan-neognaths or pan-galloanserans in previous studies
56,57. A right humerus and ulna associated with theProtodontopteryxholotype are of questionable assignment to the taxon30and were therefore disregarded for the purposes of scoring.Additional details of matrix modifications and taxon sampling are presented in the Supplementary Information.</p>
         <p>Maximum parsimony analyses were conducted in TNT v.1.558. After increasing the maximum number of trees to 10,000,a new technology search was run in which a minimum length tree was found in 10 replicates and default parameters were set for sectorial search,ratchet, tree drift and tree fusion.After this,the maximum number of trees was set to 100 and a traditional search with default parameters was run on the trees in RAM to explore treespace more extensively.Absolute bootstrap frequencies were obtained from 1,000 replicates under a traditional search with default parameters.The tree length induced by alternative phylogenetic topologies was evaluated by unchecking the ‘lock trees’ option in TNT and manually moving branches to alternative phylogenetic positions.</p>
         <p>Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MrBayes59using the CIPRES Science Gateway60. Data were analysed under the Mkv model61, taking into account the absence of invariant characters in our dataset.To allow for variation in evolutionary rate across different characters,gamma-distributed rate variation was assumed.Analyses were conducted using four chains and two independent runs,with a tree sampled every 4,000generations and a burn-in of 25%.We performed Bayesian tip-dating under the fossilized birth–death model62, implemented in MrBayes following established procedures63. An independent-gamma rates (IGR) clock model was used.The clock rate prior was set at a diffuse,uninformative rate,whereas the IGR variation,speciation,extinction and fossilization priors were set at the MrBayes default distributions:exp(10) for the former two parameters and beta(1,1) for the latter two.These settings follow other recent tip-dating studies64,65. Given that our extant taxon sample did not reflect the relative diversity of extant bird groups—focusing primarily on galloanserans (which represent 72% of our extant taxon sample,in contrast with around 4% of extant bird diversity based on recent species counts66
)—we assumed a random instead of a diversified sampling strategy.Taxon sampling 
<p>
probability was assigned a value of 0.0023,based on the fact that our extant taxon sample covers roughly 0.23% of extant bird diversity 
66.
To account for ongoing controversies about the timing of crown bird diversification,two tip-dating analyses were run, each with different 
<p>
prior age probability distributions. In one analysis,a soft-maximum upper bound was set at 86.5 Ma for crown birds, following previous justifications 
1. This represents the age of the Niobrara Formation,a well-sampled Upper Cretaceous fossil-bearing formation from which no crown bird fossils have been recovered despite an abundance of small vertebrates and crownward stem-bird fossils52,67.A previous study9
found evidence for increased nucleotide substitution rates at the base of 
<tp:taxon-name>Neornithes</tp:taxon-name>
.The authors suggested that this phenomenon might be partially responsible for the older ages estimated by other studies
68,69and outlined criteria under which the use of “appropriately conservative” age priors are justified,concluding that crownbirds—like placental mammals70—are one clade for which such conservative treatment could be warranted9. As such,a more restrictive soft maximum of 72.72 Ma was used for the second tip-dating analysis, based on the estimated age of crown birds in a previous study1. For both tip-dating analyses, a soft maximum of 120 Ma was assigned to the root (the divergence betweenIchthyornis
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Neornithes</tp:taxon-name>
) reflecting the minimum age of the Jiufotang Formation,the youngest phase of the Jehol Biota
71. This assemblage preserves an abundance of Lower Cretaceous avialan fossils, but none that are phylogenetically crownward ofIchthyornis72
. Given that no fossil crown neoavians were included in our dataset, a prior age probability distribution was assigned to the neoavian clade 
<tp:taxon-name>Gruiformes</tp:taxon-name>
,with a minimum age of 53.95 million years (the age of
<tp:taxon-name>Pellornis mikkelseni</tp:taxon-name>
, 
the oldest well-established crown gruiform73) and a soft maximum of 66million years (the age of the K–Pg boundary,prior to which no well-corroborated crown neoavian fossils have been identified74). An exponential distribution was used for all of these age priors, allowing for a5%prior probability of each clade having originated earlier than its specified soft maximum.</p>
            </p>
         </p>
         <p>The ages of fossil taxa were fixed at the minimum age constraints for the specimens that were used to score our morphological dataset, in line with best practices75and the results of experimentally testing alternative calibrations on an empirical dataset76.<tp:taxon-name>Asteriornis</tp:taxon-name>was accordingly assigned a minimum age of 66.7 million years.Most minimum age calibrations for taxa previously included in our dataset follow published ages28.Following the recommended ages of relevant fossil-bearing localities,<tp:taxon-name>Gallinuloides</tp:taxon-name>from the Green River Formation was assigned an age of51.57 million years andAnatalavisfrom the London Clay Formation was assigned an age of 53.5 million years32. Despite being known from younger strata,<tp:taxon-name>Presbyornis</tp:taxon-name>was also assigned an age of 51.57 million years because it had been scored into the dataset on the basis of specimens held at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington,DC77, which had primarily been collected from the Green River Formation.Ichthyorniswas assigned an age of 86.5 million years78,Conflictowas assigned an age of 61 million years29,<tp:taxon-name>Pelagornis</tp:taxon-name>was assigned an age of 4.8 million years55andProtodontopteryxwas assigned an age of 61.5 million years30.</p>
         <p>Undated Bayesian analyses were run for 30,000,000 generations, whereas tip-dated analyses were run for 60,000,000generations.Analytical convergence was assessed using standard diagnostics provided in MrBayes (average standard deviation of split frequencies &lt;0.02, potential scale reduction factors = 1, effective sample sizes&gt; 200). Results of independent runs of the same analyses were summarized using the sump and sumt commands in MrBayes.Morphological synapomorphies were optimized under parsimony onto resulting tree topologies using TNT. Molecular scaffolds followed the consensus from previous phylogenomic studies1,2,79–81.</p>
         <p>Estimation of body size</p>
         <p>The minimum mediolateral cross-sectional diameter of the tarsometatarsus shaft (3.32 mm) was taken from high-resolution CT scans.</p>
         <p>
This measurement was incorporated into a published scaling equa- tion for estimating the body masses of volant birds 
25(R2= 0.93) and compared with a published compilation of the body sizes of extant galloanserans82.</p>
