         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>
The archipelago of Azores is situated in the North Atlantic Ocean and is considered the most recently formed archipelago of Macaronesian islands; the oldest island, Santa Maria, has a geological age of 
8.12
M.y. and the most recent island, Pico, of 
0.3
M.y. (

Serralheiro &amp; Madeira 
1993
; 
Françaet al.2003
). The dominant natural habitat dominant in the Azorean islands, prior to human colonization about 
600
years ago, was mainly composed of laurel forest and other native shrub vegetation (

Frutuoso 
1963
). This particular 
type
of relictual forest can nowadays be found only in Macaronesia. Currently, only about 
2.5
% of the total area of Azores is occupied by patches of native forest (Triantis 
et al.2010
), and it is thought that man-caused extinctions played a major role in shaping the current patterns in the archipelago’s spider assemblages (

Cardoso 
et al.2010
a

). In addition, biological invasions are severely altering the original arthropod communities (Cardoso 
et al.2013
; 

Florencio 
et al.2013
), with invasive species replacing natives and the functions they perform in ecosystems (

Cardoso 
et al.2014
). This loss of natural habitat and its respective communities has been most intensive in the smallest islands, Graciosa and Corvo, which have lost all primary native terrestrial forest habitat, but it is also massive in most of the other islands.
</p>
         <p>
The Azorean spider fauna has received little attention before the 
20
th century. Brief reports were made by 

Simon (
1883
)

, 
Machado (1944
, 
1982
) and 

Denis (
1964
)

, and it was only by the end of the 
1980
’s that the endemic fauna of the Azorean archipelago attracted considerable attention. Joerg Wunderlich made the first intensive effort to describe Azorean spiders (
1992
), listing 
10
new endemic species. More recently, the complementary work of 

Borges &amp; Wunderlich (
2008
)

containing the description of eight additional endemic species and a first checklist of 

Cardoso 
et al.
(
2010
b)

were published. These studies were possible due to the intensive sampling effort conducted by Borges and colleagues in the scope of several projects in both native (see 

Borges 
et al.2005
and a review in Borges 
et al.2011
) and exotic (

Cardoso 
et al.
2009

, 2013, 
2014
; 

Florencio 
et al.2013
; 

Meijer 
et al.2011
) habitats.
</p>
         <p>
The large genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Lepthyphantes
Menge, 
1866</tp:taxon-name>
has recently suffered large-scale splitting, mainly due to the works of 
Saaristo &amp; Tanasevitch (1993
, 
1996
, 
1999
, 
2000
, 
2001
, 
2003
), who performed detailed comparative analyses of the genitalic features of micronetine spiders, for both males and females, which resulted in the creation of many genera. These authors also revised the diagnoses of already described genera.
</p>
         <p>
One Azorean endemic species described by 

Wunderlich (
1992
)

was 
<tp:taxon-name>Lepthyphantes acoreensis
Wunderlich, 
1992</tp:taxon-name>
. This micronetine species was originally placed in 
<tp:taxon-name>Lepthyphantes</tp:taxon-name>
but with an uncertain status (

Wunderlich 
1992
: 
374
). Since the original species description, specimens of both sexes have been captured in high abundance throughout the central group of islands, none from the eastern or western groups. The newly captured material also included specimens from two new, undescribed endemic species, closely related with 
<tp:taxon-name>L. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
. These new species were found in the western and eastern groups of islands, complementing the distribution of the previously described related species (
<tp:taxon-name>L. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
) in the archipelago.

         <p>
Most specimens were collected using pitfall traps spread through transects of roughly 
150 m
.

Half of these traps were filled with monoethyleneglicol and half with an attractive solution composed of dark beer and some preservatives (

Turquin 
1973
). Details of the sampling protocol can be found in 

Borges 
et al.
(
2005
)

. In Santa Maria Island, additional specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. relictus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were collected directly, with the use of an entomological aspirator. In the laboratory, specimens and their genitalia were studied using a Leica MZ 
9.5
, a Leica MZ 
16
or a Zeiss Stemi 
2000
. The second was used for photography, with a 
ZVCKY
–F 
1030
camera. Images were mounted with the software Auto–Montage Pro (

Syncroscopy 
1997
).
</p>
         <p>Embolic divisions were dissected from the male palps with the aid of a small scalpel and hypodermic needles. These were observed in ethanol and in methyl salicylate, and stored in ethanol.</p>
         <p>Epigyna were cleared using methyl salicylate, after being dissected from the specimen, and put back into ethanol. For simplicity, only one of the entrance grooves was drawn in the illustrations of the lateral view of cleared epigyna.</p>
         <p>
For illustrations, photos of the copulatory structures were taken and printed to A 
4
size. A drawing was made on a superimposed paper, through transparency.
</p>
         <p>
Two males and two females of 
<tp:taxon-name>L. junipericola</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
and five males and five females of 
<tp:taxon-name>L. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>L. relictus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were used for measurements. These were taken with an ocular with a ruler imbedded in it. All measurements are in mm.

            <p>Diagnosis.
Males of 
<tp:taxon-name>Canariphantes acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
can be diagnosed from all other congeners by the combination of the following palpal characters: absence of Fickert’s gland, paracymbium with a bifurcated tip (

) and terminal apophysis with several apical digitiform processes (

). Females are more difficult to diagnose because the epigynum is very similar to that of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. zonatus</tp:taxon-name>
(see 

Bosmans 
2006
), but it can be distinguished from it (and all other congeners) by the short and rounded proximal part of scape (

).

            <p>Comments.
In the original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
by 

Wunderlich (
1992
: 
567
, Fig. 
407
)

illustrated an epigynum with coiled entrance grooves and a wide stretcher. This morphology was not consistent with the genital structure of recently collected females together with males of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
from nearly all the Azorean islands of the central group (Terceira, São Jorge and Pico). All collected females appeared to have an epigynum differing from Wunderlich’s description, except for one single female from 
Flores
. The first author studied the 
type
material deposited by Wunderlich at 
ULT
and 
SNM
. All males and females of the central group of islands appeared to be identical to our specimens, but this could not be confirmed for a female from 
Flores
islands with the missing epigynum. Since none of the females of the 
type
series of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
has an epigynum resembling Wunderlich’s figures, the female with the missing excised epigynum must be the one used by Wunderlich to describe the female of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
. Both females from 
Flores
belong in fact to a new species described below.

The central group of islands with native forest patches (Terceira, São Jorge, Pico and Faial) (

). Although 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
was cited from Faial (

Wunderlich

This species builds small sheet-webs at ground level, exclusively in patches of native laurel forest. Adults were collected from May to September, but sampling outside this period was not performed.

</p>
            <p>Natural history.
This species is yet to be collected by direct hand sampling, having appeared solely through the use of pitfall trapping. Although several sites in 
Flores
Island were sampled covering a wide area in the two main native forest areas and other habitat 
types
spread through the island, the site where this species occurs is a small native forest fragment and the only one sampled in this island devoid of abundant 
<tp:taxon-name>Sphagnum</tp:taxon-name>
mosses covering the ground. In this small patch of 
<tp:taxon-name>Juniperus brevifolia</tp:taxon-name>
dominated forest, the ground has few or little herbaceous cover, due to a closed canopy. We can safely assume that 
<tp:taxon-name>C. junipericola</tp:taxon-name>
builds its webs on the ground layer of the shady 
<tp:taxon-name>J. brevifolia</tp:taxon-name>
forest. In other sites with 
<tp:taxon-name>J. brevifolia</tp:taxon-name>
cover but no extensive shade or with abundant moss cover, 
<tp:taxon-name>C. junipericola</tp:taxon-name>
is yet to be found. Adults were collected solely in June and July.

            <p>Natural history.
This species builds typical sheet-webs at ground level. The site where the majority of these spiders were caught is a marginal forest patch on Pico Alto Nature Reserve, and it was mainly composed of the exotic 
<tp:taxon-name>Cryptomeria japonica</tp:taxon-name>
and the invasive species 
<tp:taxon-name>Acacia</tp:taxon-name>
sp. and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pittosporum undulatum</tp:taxon-name>
, with a residual presence of native trees. Adults were collected from June to August, but the absence of sampling outside this period might obscure the complete phenology of this species.

            <p>Diagnosis.
Males of 
<tp:taxon-name>Canariphantes acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
can be diagnosed from all other congeners by the combination of the following palpal characters: absence of Fickert’s gland, paracymbium with a bifurcated tip (

) and terminal apophysis with several apical digitiform processes (

). Females are more difficult to diagnose because the epigynum is very similar to that of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. zonatus</tp:taxon-name>
(see 

Bosmans 
2006
), but it can be distinguished from it (and all other congeners) by the short and rounded proximal part of scape (

).

            <p>Comments.
In the original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
by 

Wunderlich (
1992
: 
567
, Fig. 
407
)

illustrated an epigynum with coiled entrance grooves and a wide stretcher. This morphology was not consistent with the genital structure of recently collected females together with males of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
from nearly all the Azorean islands of the central group (Terceira, São Jorge and Pico). All collected females appeared to have an epigynum differing from Wunderlich’s description, except for one single female from 
Flores
. The first author studied the 
type
material deposited by Wunderlich at 
ULT
and 
SNM
. All males and females of the central group of islands appeared to be identical to our specimens, but this could not be confirmed for a female from 
Flores
islands with the missing epigynum. Since none of the females of the 
type
series of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
has an epigynum resembling Wunderlich’s figures, the female with the missing excised epigynum must be the one used by Wunderlich to describe the female of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
. Both females from 
Flores
belong in fact to a new species described below.

The central group of islands with native forest patches (Terceira, São Jorge, Pico and Faial) (

). Although 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
was cited from Faial (

Wunderlich

This species builds small sheet-webs at ground level, exclusively in patches of native laurel forest. Adults were collected from May to September, but sampling outside this period was not performed.

</p>
            <p>Natural history.
This species is yet to be collected by direct hand sampling, having appeared solely through the use of pitfall trapping. Although several sites in 
Flores
Island were sampled covering a wide area in the two main native forest areas and other habitat 
types
spread through the island, the site where this species occurs is a small native forest fragment and the only one sampled in this island devoid of abundant 
<tp:taxon-name>Sphagnum</tp:taxon-name>
mosses covering the ground. In this small patch of 
<tp:taxon-name>Juniperus brevifolia</tp:taxon-name>
dominated forest, the ground has few or little herbaceous cover, due to a closed canopy. We can safely assume that 
<tp:taxon-name>C. junipericola</tp:taxon-name>
builds its webs on the ground layer of the shady 
<tp:taxon-name>J. brevifolia</tp:taxon-name>
forest. In other sites with 
<tp:taxon-name>J. brevifolia</tp:taxon-name>
cover but no extensive shade or with abundant moss cover, 
<tp:taxon-name>C. junipericola</tp:taxon-name>
is yet to be found. Adults were collected solely in June and July.

            <p>Natural history.
This species builds typical sheet-webs at ground level. The site where the majority of these spiders were caught is a marginal forest patch on Pico Alto Nature Reserve, and it was mainly composed of the exotic 
<tp:taxon-name>Cryptomeria japonica</tp:taxon-name>
and the invasive species 
<tp:taxon-name>Acacia</tp:taxon-name>
sp. and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pittosporum undulatum</tp:taxon-name>
, with a residual presence of native trees. Adults were collected from June to August, but the absence of sampling outside this period might obscure the complete phenology of this species.

            <p>Diagnosis.
Males of 
<tp:taxon-name>Canariphantes acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
can be diagnosed from all other congeners by the combination of the following palpal characters: absence of Fickert’s gland, paracymbium with a bifurcated tip (

) and terminal apophysis with several apical digitiform processes (

). Females are more difficult to diagnose because the epigynum is very similar to that of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. zonatus</tp:taxon-name>
(see 

Bosmans 
2006
), but it can be distinguished from it (and all other congeners) by the short and rounded proximal part of scape (

).

            <p>Comments.
In the original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
by 

Wunderlich (
1992
: 
567
, Fig. 
407
)

illustrated an epigynum with coiled entrance grooves and a wide stretcher. This morphology was not consistent with the genital structure of recently collected females together with males of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
from nearly all the Azorean islands of the central group (Terceira, São Jorge and Pico). All collected females appeared to have an epigynum differing from Wunderlich’s description, except for one single female from 
Flores
. The first author studied the 
type
material deposited by Wunderlich at 
ULT
and 
SNM
. All males and females of the central group of islands appeared to be identical to our specimens, but this could not be confirmed for a female from 
Flores
islands with the missing epigynum. Since none of the females of the 
type
series of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
has an epigynum resembling Wunderlich’s figures, the female with the missing excised epigynum must be the one used by Wunderlich to describe the female of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
. Both females from 
Flores
belong in fact to a new species described below.

The central group of islands with native forest patches (Terceira, São Jorge, Pico and Faial) (

). Although 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
was cited from Faial (

Wunderlich

This species builds small sheet-webs at ground level, exclusively in patches of native laurel forest. Adults were collected from May to September, but sampling outside this period was not performed.

</p>
            <p>Natural history.
This species is yet to be collected by direct hand sampling, having appeared solely through the use of pitfall trapping. Although several sites in 
Flores
Island were sampled covering a wide area in the two main native forest areas and other habitat 
types
spread through the island, the site where this species occurs is a small native forest fragment and the only one sampled in this island devoid of abundant 
<tp:taxon-name>Sphagnum</tp:taxon-name>
mosses covering the ground. In this small patch of 
<tp:taxon-name>Juniperus brevifolia</tp:taxon-name>
dominated forest, the ground has few or little herbaceous cover, due to a closed canopy. We can safely assume that 
<tp:taxon-name>C. junipericola</tp:taxon-name>
builds its webs on the ground layer of the shady 
<tp:taxon-name>J. brevifolia</tp:taxon-name>
forest. In other sites with 
<tp:taxon-name>J. brevifolia</tp:taxon-name>
cover but no extensive shade or with abundant moss cover, 
<tp:taxon-name>C. junipericola</tp:taxon-name>
is yet to be found. Adults were collected solely in June and July.

            <p>Natural history.
This species builds typical sheet-webs at ground level. The site where the majority of these spiders were caught is a marginal forest patch on Pico Alto Nature Reserve, and it was mainly composed of the exotic 
<tp:taxon-name>Cryptomeria japonica</tp:taxon-name>
and the invasive species 
<tp:taxon-name>Acacia</tp:taxon-name>
sp. and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pittosporum undulatum</tp:taxon-name>
, with a residual presence of native trees. Adults were collected from June to August, but the absence of sampling outside this period might obscure the complete phenology of this species.

            <p>Diagnosis.
Males of 
<tp:taxon-name>Canariphantes acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
can be diagnosed from all other congeners by the combination of the following palpal characters: absence of Fickert’s gland, paracymbium with a bifurcated tip (

) and terminal apophysis with several apical digitiform processes (

). Females are more difficult to diagnose because the epigynum is very similar to that of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. zonatus</tp:taxon-name>
(see 

Bosmans 
2006
), but it can be distinguished from it (and all other congeners) by the short and rounded proximal part of scape (

).

            <p>Comments.
In the original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
by 

Wunderlich (
1992
: 
567
, Fig. 
407
)

illustrated an epigynum with coiled entrance grooves and a wide stretcher. This morphology was not consistent with the genital structure of recently collected females together with males of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
from nearly all the Azorean islands of the central group (Terceira, São Jorge and Pico). All collected females appeared to have an epigynum differing from Wunderlich’s description, except for one single female from 
Flores
. The first author studied the 
type
material deposited by Wunderlich at 
ULT
and 
SNM
. All males and females of the central group of islands appeared to be identical to our specimens, but this could not be confirmed for a female from 
Flores
islands with the missing epigynum. Since none of the females of the 
type
series of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
has an epigynum resembling Wunderlich’s figures, the female with the missing excised epigynum must be the one used by Wunderlich to describe the female of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
. Both females from 
Flores
belong in fact to a new species described below.

The central group of islands with native forest patches (Terceira, São Jorge, Pico and Faial) (

). Although 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
was cited from Faial (

Wunderlich

This species builds small sheet-webs at ground level, exclusively in patches of native laurel forest. Adults were collected from May to September, but sampling outside this period was not performed.

            <p>Natural history.
This species is yet to be collected by direct hand sampling, having appeared solely through the use of pitfall trapping. Although several sites in 
Flores
Island were sampled covering a wide area in the two main native forest areas and other habitat 
types
spread through the island, the site where this species occurs is a small native forest fragment and the only one sampled in this island devoid of abundant 
<tp:taxon-name>Sphagnum</tp:taxon-name>
mosses covering the ground. In this small patch of 
<tp:taxon-name>Juniperus brevifolia</tp:taxon-name>
dominated forest, the ground has few or little herbaceous cover, due to a closed canopy. We can safely assume that 
<tp:taxon-name>C. junipericola</tp:taxon-name>
builds its webs on the ground layer of the shady 
<tp:taxon-name>J. brevifolia</tp:taxon-name>
forest. In other sites with 
<tp:taxon-name>J. brevifolia</tp:taxon-name>
cover but no extensive shade or with abundant moss cover, 
<tp:taxon-name>C. junipericola</tp:taxon-name>
is yet to be found. Adults were collected solely in June and July.

This species builds typical sheet-webs at ground level. The site where the majority of these spiders were caught is a marginal forest patch on Pico Alto Nature Reserve, and it was mainly composed of the exotic 
<tp:taxon-name>Cryptomeria japonica</tp:taxon-name>
and the invasive species 
<tp:taxon-name>Acacia</tp:taxon-name>
sp. and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pittosporum undulatum</tp:taxon-name>
, with a residual presence of native trees. Adults were collected from June to August, but the absence of sampling outside this period might obscure the complete phenology of this species.

         <p>Systematics.
The problem of genus assignment whenever new micronetines are found can sometimes be puzzling, and this case is not an exception. Although some recent genera are now well known and distinct, due to the works of 
Saaristo &amp; Tanasevitch (1993
, 
1996
, 
1999
, 
2000
, 
2001
, 
2003
), others remain somewhat obscure, and the discovery of new species in these obscure genera tends to broaden their limits. While searching for affinities within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Micronetinae</tp:taxon-name>
, the first two authors noticed some special features of these Azorean endemics. First, their embolic divisions lack a Fickert’s gland. Wunderlich had illustrated a Fickert’s gland in 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
(

Wunderlich 
1992
: 
566
, Fig. 
402
) but, after many observations, the authors failed to find one in the three species accounted for; in all three species described here the sperm duct descends from the embolus and coils into the column and then into the suprategulum without any enlargement along its way. Second, the males of the species described here have an embolus with a terminal retrolateral thumb, and that does not fit into 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lepthyphantes 
sensu</tp:taxon-name>
stricto

, because as defined by 

Saaristo &amp; Tanasevitch (
1996
: 
177
)

, the embolus of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lepthyphantes 
sensu</tp:taxon-name>
stricto

is “massive and sickleshaped with tight sulcus and large carina.” Remarkable similarities are found with the embolus of the genera 
<tp:taxon-name>Bolyphantes</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Agnyphantes</tp:taxon-name>
and 
Bolepthyphantes
(

Saaristo &amp; Tanasevitch 
2000
), but unlike the species of these genera, the new species do not present dorsal cymbial modifications. Third, all of the hereby described species show epigyna with short scapes, like that reported for the 
Bolyphantes-Poeciloneta
division of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Micronetinae</tp:taxon-name>
. For these reasons we have decided to place the two new species in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Canariphantes</tp:taxon-name>
. The genitalia of the 
type
species, 
<tp:taxon-name>C. alpicola</tp:taxon-name>
, is very similar to the species described here: the embolic division presents a lobed thumb, a simple lamella characteristica, a relatively simple terminal apophysis and no projections in the cymbium; and the epigyna have a very short scape. We also add that this genus has representatives on the Macaronesia and Mediterranean, which from a biogeographical standpoint, is congruent with this conjecture. Until large-scale cladistic studies are done within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lepthyphantes 
sensu</tp:taxon-name>
lato

, 
<tp:taxon-name>Canariphantes</tp:taxon-name>
seems to be the closest to the natural placement of these endemic spiders of the Azores.
</p>
         <p>Conservation and protection measures.
Both new species described here are restricted to single forest patches in single Azorean islands (

), and were not found in disturbed habitats sampled for other projects, such as semi-natural grasslands or pastures (

Meijer 
et al.2011
; Cardoso 
et al.
2013, 2014; 

Florencio 
et al.2013
). 
<tp:taxon-name>C. junipericola</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
is found in a single forest of 
2.4 km2
, Caldeira Funda e Rasa Nature Reserve in 
Flores
Island. This forest is highly disturbed, dominated by many invasive species (

Cardoso 
et al.2007
; Gaspar 
et al.2011
). Nevertheless, it is extremely difficult to know the current population trend of the species (the Prestonian shortfall, see 

Cardoso 
et al.2011
b

), since it was not found in several collecting trips made before 
2010
or in the neighboring and more pristine forest of Morro Alto and Pico da Sé. We hypothesize that this could be explained by the fact that most of Morro Alto and Pico da Sé is composed of open 
<tp:taxon-name>Sphagnum</tp:taxon-name>
peat bogs with the ground of forest patches being entirely covered by several meters depth of this moss, and these spiders might prefer secluded havens of shady 
<tp:taxon-name>Juniperus brevifolia</tp:taxon-name>
forest with little moss cover. These two Nature Reserves are the only remaining native forest fragments of 
Flores
. The absence of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. junipericola</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
in the dominant 
<tp:taxon-name>Sphagnum</tp:taxon-name>
covered 
<tp:taxon-name>Juniperus</tp:taxon-name>
forest in 
Flores
and its restricted distribution to a small disturbed and isolated fragment makes its conservation a priority.
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>C. relictus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
is found only in an equally highly disturbed, minute forest with 
0.09 km2
, Pico Alto in Santa Maria Island (

Cardoso 
et al.2007
; Gaspar 
et al.2011
; 

Meijer 
et al.2011
), the only remaining native forest patch of the island. As with the previous species, it is hard to know the current population trends since before 
2010
most specimens found were juveniles in pitfall traps and few adult females or males.
</p>
         <p>
Both islands were covered by forest before human settlement almost 
600
years ago. Loss of native forest is a major cause of past and future extinctions of spiders (

Cardoso 
et al.2010
a

) and arthropods (Triantis 
et al.2010
) in this archipelago. However, in the view of the present data, we cannot suggest that any of these species is in decline, and possibly have populations elsewhere in undisturbed exotic forests (see 

Meijer 
et al.2011
).
</p>
         <p>
The current knowledge allows us however to suggest a classification according to the 
IUCN
criteria (
IUCN2001
; 

Cardoso 
et al.2011
a

). With an Area Of Occupancy &lt;
20 km2
, and presence in a single location, a category of Vulnerable is currently suggested for both species. If continuing decline or extreme fluctuations are found then a status of Critically Endangered could eventually be suggested for both.
</p>
         <p>
It should be noted that the Pico Alto Nature Reserve is an extremely small fragment of native habitat in the oldest island of the Azores, but can be considered a hotspot of diversity with 
57
endemic species, 
i.e.21
% of the Azorean endemic arthropods occur in less than 
0.25
% of the current area of native forest (Borges 
et al.2011
). Due to its age (
8.12
M.y.), Santa Maria is home for a number of single-island endemic arthropod species (

Borges &amp; Hortal 
2009
) that survive in precarious situation either in this forest fragment or in surrounding, surrogate, habitat (

Meijer 
et al.2011
). Yet, 
<tp:taxon-name>C. relictus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
is the only spider considered as single island endemic in Santa Maria, as probably many species in this island were driven to extinction before description (

Cardoso 
et al.2010
a

). Concerning the widespread species 
<tp:taxon-name>C. acoreensis</tp:taxon-name>
,

most areas in Terceira and Pico are well preserved, but in São Jorge and Faial are very disturbed. The only way to guarantee the survival of the island’s many endemic arthropod species would be to recover the native forest in a large area.
