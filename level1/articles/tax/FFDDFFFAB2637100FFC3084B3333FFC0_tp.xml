The atyid genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya
Bouvier, 
1913</tp:taxon-name>
was previously considered to be monotypic. The area in which the genus is distributed is limited to the islands of the Antilles and Central 
America
, with the 
type
locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
being in 
Cuba
. A recent molecular phylogenetic analysis of atyid shrimps from the Caribbean indicated the probable existence of a second species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
from samples collected in 
Puerto Rico
. Here it is described as the new species 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya cooki</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, differing from its congener in the armature of the dactyli on the fifth pereiopod, the uropodal diaeresis, the distal margin of the telson and by the spinulation of the appendix masculina in male specimens. Because the 
type
specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
are most probably lost, a 
neotype
for 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
was designated.

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>
The atyid genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
was previously monospecific, with the single species 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
. Originally, the species was only known from 
Cuba
(Bouvier 
1909
a, 
1913
), but later 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
was also found on other islands of the Antilles. F.A. Chace &amp; H.H. Hobbs (
1969
) reported 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Dominica
, 
Jamaica
, 
Puerto Rico
, 
Martinique
, and mentioned a single ovigerous specimen from 
Costa Rica
, which had been collected by D.P. Kelso in Tortuguero. Holthuis (
1977
) reported 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Curaçao
, 
Grenada
, 
Barbados
, and Abele &amp; Kim (
1989
) and Torati 
et al.
(
2011
) both reported it from 
Panama
.
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
was originally described by Guérin-Méneville as 
<tp:taxon-name>Atya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
with only a few sentences. The exact date of the first description of 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
was not very clear for a long time and varying dates of publication were given by several authors: Bouvier 
1925
: 
1857
; Schmitt &amp; Shoemaker 
1935
: 
1856
(
1857
); Chace &amp; Hobbs 
1969
: 
1855
.
</p>
         <p>
The first description of the species was published in the great work on 
Cuba
“Historie Physique, Politique et Natuerelle de L´Ile de 
Cuba
” Volume VII and VIII by Ramon de la Sagra. The publication of Volume VII was delayed by disputes with the scientist Lefebvre. Therefore, Volume VIII "Atlas de Zoologica" was already published with the drawings of the descriptions in Volume VII in 
1855
. Volume VII was later published in two editions. One copy of the French edition of "Crustacés" of 
1857
includes additional comments by F. E. Guèrin- Méneville dated 
10
.X. 
1857
(Guèrin-Méneville, F.E. (
1857
b)). Another Spanish edition of "Crustaceos" of 
1856
(MDCCCLVI) contains an introduction by R. de la Sagra with date 
20
.IX. 
1857
(Guèrin-Méneville, F.E. (
1857
a)). This edition was also published 
1857
, with the delay of the publication explained in the introduction. The first valid mention is therefore 
1855 in
the Volume VIII, Atlas de Zoologica, Plate 7, 7a and 
7
b (Articulata 

Tab. 
2
) with the drawings of 
<tp:taxon-name>Atya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
. The issue of publication date was recently discussed and explained in detail by De Grave &amp; Fransen (
2011
): “Thus, for the species mentioned in both the French and Spanish editions, for instance 
<tp:taxon-name>Atya Poeyi
Guérin-Méneville, 
1855</tp:taxon-name>
[in Guérin-Méneville, 
1855-1856
] we employ 
1855
as their description date, corresponding to the date on the frontispiece of Tomo VIII (Atlas de Zoologia), with the corresponding text in Tomo VII (Crustáceos, Aragnides é Insectos) with 
1856
on the frontispiece.”
</p>
         <p>
In 
1909
E.-L. Bouvier (
1909
b) erected a new genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Calmania</tp:taxon-name>
for this species on the basis of the branchial formula. But because this name was already occupied by a brachyuran crab, he subsequently renamed the genus as 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
in 
1913
due to its resemblance to the major species of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Atya</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
In the course of a molecular phylogeny of atyid shrimps of the Caribbean, it was realized that mitochondrial DNA sequences of specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Puerto Rico
clearly fell into two distinct clusters (see Page 
et al.2008
), implying the presence of a second species. The addition of nuclear DNA sequence data in Von Rintelen 
et al.
(
2012
) further confirmed the distinction. Subsequent investigations revealed morphological differences between the putative new species and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
and thus represents a good case of the taxonomic feedback loop (
sensu
Page 
et al.2005
) in operation, with independent datasets agreeing on a common conclusion.

February 
2006
in 
Puerto Rico
(

The historical material was collected by Paul Serre in 
1909 inCuba
. A 
neotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
was selected from this collection, which is deposited in the crustacean collection of the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle Paris.

         <p>
The abbreviation cl is used for carapace length, measured from the postorbital margin to the posterior margin of the carapace and expressed in mm. The length of the antennular peduncle was measured from the orbital margin to the distodorsal margin of the third segment. Because this genus has been monotypic for a long time, records in the literature of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
could potentially represent either this species or 
<tp:taxon-name>M. cooki</tp:taxon-name>
.

Species of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
show a reduced branchial formula (

), lacking pleurobranchies on fifth pereiopod. There are also no epipods on the fourth pereiopod. For these characters 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
is similar to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Halocaridina</tp:taxon-name>
from Hawaii, but 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
has one well developed and one reduced arthrobranch at third maxilliped and podobranchies on second maxilliped. This character combination resembles the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Limnocaridella</tp:taxon-name>
, but the latter lacks podobranchies at second maxilliped.

            <p>Remarks.
The original 
type
specimen described by Guérin-Méneville originated from a collection of Cuban material without further specification. The description as 
<tp:taxon-name>Atya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
by Guérin-Méneville comprises only a few sentences without accurate information on body proportions or details on spinulation of appendages. Most of the collections described by F.E. Guérin-Méneville are deposited in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia but 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
is not cataloged here (Spamer &amp; Bogan, 
1994
). In the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, where a part of the collections are also deposited, no specimen of this species could be found (S. De Grave, personal communication). Two attempts to locate this 
type
material at the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle Paris were also unsuccessful (Laure Corbari &amp; Paula Martin Lefevre, personal communication). Thus the 
type
series seem to be lost. To stabilize taxonomy, a 
neotype
was designated here for a specimen selected from the Cuban collections of P. Serre, deposited in the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle Paris. Specimens from this collection had also been used by E.-L. Bouvier for his studies, which resulted in the description of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The examined specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
indicate a sexual dimorphism. In addition to the smaller body size of males (cl. 
3.65–4.1 in
males vs. 
6.2–6.7 in
females), the two sexes differ in proportions of propodus on third pereiopod (
7.86
times as long as wide in males vs. 
5.29
–6.00 in females); dactylus on third pereiopod (
3.17
times as long as wide in males vs. 
1.85–2.27
times in female) and the propodus on fifth pereiopod (
11.14
times as long as wide vs. 
7.80–9.36
). This is the first time that a sexual dimorphism in 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
has been reported.

</tp:taxon-name>
. It can be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
in the armature of the dactyli on the fifth pereiopod (with 
17–30
spinules on flexor margin vs. 
24–43 in<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
), the armature of the uropodal diaeresis (
16–18
movable spinules vs. 
20–23 in<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
) and a different armature of the distal margin of the telson (
10–12
distal spines vs. 
14–16
distal spines in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
). The armature of the rostrum is more variable in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. cooki</tp:taxon-name>
which lacks teeth on carapace posterior to orbital margin (
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
with 
0–2

3–9
teeth (
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
with 
7–9
), ventral teeth with 
0–4
vs. 
1–4 in<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
. Male specimens can distinghuished by the spinulation of the appendix masculina (

). In 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
the spines are located near distal end of appendix masculina, the tip of appendix interna does not reach to the spinulated part of the appendix masculina. In 
<tp:taxon-name>M. cooki</tp:taxon-name>
the spines extend more proximally, the tip of appendix interna reaches into the spinulated part of the appendix masculina. In living specimens, 
<tp:taxon-name>M
. 
poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
has 
3
distinct white vertical color bands on a dark body (see Karge &amp; Klotz 
2008

120
), while the living color patterns of 
<tp:taxon-name>M
. 
cooki</tp:taxon-name>
are not yet clear but may resemble one of the two other color patterns recognized by Chace &amp; Hobbs (
1969
). Although both species are very similar in morphological characteristics, they can be clearly distinguished by molecular data.

Species of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
show a reduced branchial formula (

), lacking pleurobranchies on fifth pereiopod. There are also no epipods on the fourth pereiopod. For these characters 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
is similar to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Halocaridina</tp:taxon-name>
from Hawaii, but 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
has one well developed and one reduced arthrobranch at third maxilliped and podobranchies on second maxilliped. This character combination resembles the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Limnocaridella</tp:taxon-name>
, but the latter lacks podobranchies at second maxilliped.

            <p>Remarks.
The original 
type
specimen described by Guérin-Méneville originated from a collection of Cuban material without further specification. The description as 
<tp:taxon-name>Atya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
by Guérin-Méneville comprises only a few sentences without accurate information on body proportions or details on spinulation of appendages. Most of the collections described by F.E. Guérin-Méneville are deposited in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia but 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
is not cataloged here (Spamer &amp; Bogan, 
1994
). In the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, where a part of the collections are also deposited, no specimen of this species could be found (S. De Grave, personal communication). Two attempts to locate this 
type
material at the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle Paris were also unsuccessful (Laure Corbari &amp; Paula Martin Lefevre, personal communication). Thus the 
type
series seem to be lost. To stabilize taxonomy, a 
neotype
was designated here for a specimen selected from the Cuban collections of P. Serre, deposited in the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle Paris. Specimens from this collection had also been used by E.-L. Bouvier for his studies, which resulted in the description of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The examined specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
indicate a sexual dimorphism. In addition to the smaller body size of males (cl. 
3.65–4.1 in
males vs. 
6.2–6.7 in
females), the two sexes differ in proportions of propodus on third pereiopod (
7.86
times as long as wide in males vs. 
5.29
–6.00 in females); dactylus on third pereiopod (
3.17
times as long as wide in males vs. 
1.85–2.27
times in female) and the propodus on fifth pereiopod (
11.14
times as long as wide vs. 
7.80–9.36
). This is the first time that a sexual dimorphism in 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
has been reported.

is known from some streams in 
Puerto Rico
. The small egg size, suggesting prolonged larval development similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
, and lack of phylogeographic structure across the large island of 
Puerto Rico
(Cook 
et al.2009
), both indicate that it probably has a wider distributional range in the Caribbean.

            <p>Remarks.<tp:taxon-name>Micratya cooki</tp:taxon-name>
is very similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi
(F.E. Guèrin-Méneville, 
1855
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. It can be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
in the armature of the dactyli on the fifth pereiopod (with 
17–30
spinules on flexor margin vs. 
24–43 in<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
), the armature of the uropodal diaeresis (
16–18
movable spinules vs. 
20–23 in<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
) and a different armature of the distal margin of the telson (
10–12
distal spines vs. 
14–16
distal spines in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
). The armature of the rostrum is more variable in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. cooki</tp:taxon-name>
which lacks teeth on carapace posterior to orbital margin (
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
with 
0–2
) and armed dorsally with 
3–9
teeth (
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
with 
7–9
), ventral teeth with 
0–4
vs. 
1–4 in<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
. Male specimens can distinghuished by the spinulation of the appendix masculina (

). In 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
the spines are located near distal end of appendix masculina, the tip of appendix interna does not reach to the spinulated part of the appendix masculina. In 
<tp:taxon-name>M. cooki</tp:taxon-name>
the spines extend more proximally, the tip of appendix interna reaches into the spinulated part of the appendix masculina. In living specimens, 
<tp:taxon-name>M
. 
poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
has 
3
distinct white vertical color bands on a dark body (see Karge &amp; Klotz 
2008
, p 
120
), while the living color patterns of 
<tp:taxon-name>M
. 
cooki</tp:taxon-name>
are not yet clear but may resemble one of the two other color patterns recognized by Chace &amp; Hobbs (
1969
). Although both species are very similar in morphological characteristics, they can be clearly distinguished by molecular data.

Species of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
show a reduced branchial formula (

), lacking pleurobranchies on fifth pereiopod. There are also no epipods on the fourth pereiopod. For these characters 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
is similar to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Halocaridina</tp:taxon-name>
from Hawaii, but 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
has one well developed and one reduced arthrobranch at third maxilliped and podobranchies on second maxilliped. This character combination resembles the genus

, but the latter lacks podobranchies at second maxilliped.

            <p>Remarks.
The original 
type
specimen described by Guérin-Méneville originated from a collection of Cuban material without further specification. The description as 
<tp:taxon-name>Atya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
by Guérin-Méneville comprises only a few sentences without accurate information on body proportions or details on spinulation of appendages. Most of the collections described by F.E. Guérin-Méneville are deposited in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia but 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
is not cataloged here (Spamer &amp; Bogan, 
1994
). In the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, where a part of the collections are also deposited, no specimen of this species could be found (S. De Grave, personal communication). Two attempts to locate this 
type
material at the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle Paris were also unsuccessful (Laure Corbari &amp; Paula Martin Lefevre, personal communication). Thus the 
type
series seem to be lost. To stabilize taxonomy, a 
neotype
was designated here for a specimen selected from the Cuban collections of P. Serre, deposited in the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle Paris. Specimens from this collection had also been used by E.-L. Bouvier for his studies, which resulted in the description of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The examined specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
indicate a sexual dimorphism. In addition to the smaller body size of males (cl. 
3.65–4.1 in
males vs. 
6.2–6.7 in
females), the two sexes differ in proportions of propodus on third pereiopod (
7.86
times as long as wide in males vs. 
5.29
–6.00 in females); dactylus on third pereiopod (
3.17
times as long as wide in males vs. 
1.85–2.27
times in female) and the propodus on fifth pereiopod (
11.14
times as long as wide vs. 
7.80–9.36
). This is the first time that a sexual dimorphism in 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
has been reported.

, and lack of phylogeographic structure across the large island of

(Cook

(F.E. Guèrin-Méneville,

)
</tp:taxon-name>
. It can be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
in the armature of the dactyli on the fifth pereiopod (with 
17–30
spinules on flexor margin vs. 
24–43 in<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
), the armature of the uropodal diaeresis (
16–18
movable spinules vs. 
20–23 in<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
) and a different armature of the distal margin of the telson (
10–12
distal spines vs. 
14–16
distal spines in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
). The armature of the rostrum is more variable in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. cooki</tp:taxon-name>
which lacks teeth on carapace posterior to orbital margin (
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
with 
0–2
) and armed dorsally with 
3–9
teeth (
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
with 
7–9
), ventral teeth with 
0–4
vs. 
1–4 in<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
. Male specimens can distinghuished by the spinulation of the appendix masculina (

). In 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
the spines are located near distal end of appendix masculina, the tip of appendix interna does not reach to the spinulated part of the appendix masculina. In 
<tp:taxon-name>M. cooki</tp:taxon-name>
the spines extend more proximally, the tip of appendix interna reaches into the spinulated part of the appendix masculina. In living specimens, 
<tp:taxon-name>M
. 
poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
has 
3
distinct white vertical color bands on a dark body (see Karge &amp; Klotz 
2008
, p 
120
), while the living color patterns of 
<tp:taxon-name>M
. 
cooki</tp:taxon-name>
are not yet clear but may resemble one of the two other color patterns recognized by Chace &amp; Hobbs (
1969
). Although both species are very similar in morphological characteristics, they can be clearly distinguished by molecular data.

Species of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
show a reduced branchial formula (

), lacking pleurobranchies on fifth pereiopod. There are also no epipods on the fourth pereiopod. For these characters 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
is similar to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Halocaridina</tp:taxon-name>
from Hawaii, but 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
has one well developed and one reduced arthrobranch at third maxilliped and podobranchies on second maxilliped. This character combination resembles the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Limnocaridella</tp:taxon-name>
, but the latter lacks podobranchies at second maxilliped.

            <p>Remarks.
The original 
type
specimen described by Guérin-Méneville originated from a collection of Cuban material without further specification. The description as 
<tp:taxon-name>Atya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
by Guérin-Méneville comprises only a few sentences without accurate information on body proportions or details on spinulation of appendages. Most of the collections described by F.E. Guérin-Méneville are deposited in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia but 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
is not cataloged here (Spamer &amp; Bogan, 
1994
). In the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, where a part of the collections are also deposited, no specimen of this species could be found (S. De Grave, personal communication). Two attempts to locate this 
type
material at the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle Paris were also unsuccessful (Laure Corbari &amp; Paula Martin Lefevre, personal communication). Thus the 
type
series seem to be lost. To stabilize taxonomy, a 
neotype
was designated here for a specimen selected from the Cuban collections of P. Serre, deposited in the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle Paris. Specimens from this collection had also been used by E.-L. Bouvier for his studies, which resulted in the description of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The examined specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
indicate a sexual dimorphism. In addition to the smaller body size of males (cl. 
3.65–4.1 in
males vs. 
6.2–6.7 in
females), the two sexes differ in proportions of propodus on third pereiopod (
7.86
times as long as wide in males vs. 
5.29
–6.00 in females); dactylus on third pereiopod (
3.17
times as long as wide in males vs. 
1.85–2.27
times in female) and the propodus on fifth pereiopod (
11.14
times as long as wide vs. 
7.80–9.36
). This is the first time that a sexual dimorphism in 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
has been reported.

is known from some streams in 
Puerto Rico
. The small egg size, suggesting prolonged larval development similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
, and lack of phylogeographic structure across the large island of 
Puerto Rico
(Cook 
et al.2009
), both indicate that it probably has a wider distributional range in the Caribbean.

is very similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi
(F.E. Guèrin-Méneville, 
1855
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. It can be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
in the armature of the dactyli on the fifth pereiopod (with 
17–30
spinules on flexor margin vs. 
24–43 in<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
), the armature of the uropodal diaeresis (
16–18
movable spinules vs. 
20–23 in<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
) and a different armature of the distal margin of the telson (
10–12
distal spines vs. 
14–16
distal spines in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
). The armature of the rostrum is more variable in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. cooki</tp:taxon-name>
which lacks teeth on carapace posterior to orbital margin (
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
with 
0–2
) and armed dorsally with 
3–9
teeth (
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
with 
7–9
), ventral teeth with 
0–4
vs. 
1–4 in<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
. Male specimens can distinghuished by the spinulation of the appendix masculina (

). In 
<tp:taxon-name>M. poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
the spines are located near distal end of appendix masculina, the tip of appendix interna does not reach to the spinulated part of the appendix masculina. In 
<tp:taxon-name>M. cooki</tp:taxon-name>
the spines extend more proximally, the tip of appendix interna reaches into the spinulated part of the appendix masculina. In living specimens, 
<tp:taxon-name>M
. 
poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
has 
3
distinct white vertical color bands on a dark body (see Karge &amp; Klotz 
2008
, p 
120
), while the living color patterns of 
<tp:taxon-name>M
. 
cooki</tp:taxon-name>
are not yet clear but may resemble one of the two other color patterns recognized by Chace &amp; Hobbs (
1969
). Although both species are very similar in morphological characteristics, they can be clearly distinguished by molecular data.

There are five gene regions which have been sequenced for both 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya poeyi</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. cooki</tp:taxon-name>
, all of which show a species-level divergence. Page 
et al.
(
2008
) showed a deep split between the two putative 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
species using two mitochondrial genes, the 
3
’ portion of cytochrome 
c
oxidase I (COI) and 
16
S ribosomal DNA (
16
S). Cook 
et al.
(
2009
) used the 
5
’ portion of COI (the “DNA barcode” 
sensu
Costa 
et al.2007
) in their within-species study of the two 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
taxa. Von Rintelen 
et al.
(
2012
) used mitochondrial 
16
S and two nuclear genes, 
28
S ribosomal DNA (
28
S) and Histone (H 
3
), and found the two species distinct. We have listed all of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Micratya</tp:taxon-name>
sequences currently available on GenBank (as of 0 
7
January

, 
2013
) by species (

Table 
2
) and compared the levels of divergence (using Kimura 
2
-parameter distance model) of each of these gene regions between the two taxa. As expected, the least divergent gene was the nuclear H 
3
fragment (
0.93
% between the species), followed by nuclear 
28
S (
2.39
%). The 
16
S fragment was 
8.33
% different (EF 
489991
vs. EF 
489994
). The two COI fragments were a similar level of divergence to each other, with 
3
’ COI 
16.69
% divergent (EF 
489979
vs. EF 
489981
) and 
5
’ COI 
15.95
% divergent (FJ 
348827
vs. FJ 
348928
), using the “barcode” portion equivalent to positions 
132 to 699
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Halocaridina rubra
Holthuis, 
1963</tp:taxon-name>
mitochondrial genome (Ivey 
et al.2007

(
