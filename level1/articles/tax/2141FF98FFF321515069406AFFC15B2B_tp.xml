A new genus, 
<tp:taxon-name>Arktourella</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
, is proposed to accommodate a new member of the harpacticoid family 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. margarethae</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
, from a polluted estuary in north-western 
Mexico
. The new genus was attributed to the laophontoidean family 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
on account of the lack of outer spinous processes on the second antennulary segment, one abexopodal seta on the antennary allobasis, four setae on the one-segmented antennary exopod, endopod of first swimming leg two-segmented with first segment elongated and with two distal elements on second segment, endopods of second to fourth legs two-segmented, distal setae on the male second endopodal segment of second and third legs reduced, and outer spine of the male second endopodal segment of third leg fused to segment. The new, so far monotypic genus, differs from the other normanellid genera in the presence of four elements on the third exopodal segment of the first leg, and two outer spines on the third exopodal segment of second to fourth legs. No synapomorphies were observed for 
<tp:taxon-name>Arktourella</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
, but they are unique within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
in that the mandibular basis and endopod are not fused. Maximum parsimony analysis and Bayesian inference using 59 morphological characters to assess the relationships between the genera of the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
confirmed the affinity of 
<tp:taxon-name>Arktourella</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
, and their sister group relationship with

. 
<tp:taxon-name>Paranaiara</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudocletodes</tp:taxon-name>
were shown consistently to be closely related and are the sister taxa of

share the presence of a large spinulose spine on the fifth and sixth segments of the female antennule, but its significance is not clear. Additionally, we propose a key to the genera of the

The family 
<tp:taxon-name>
Normanellidae 
Lang, 1944</tp:taxon-name>
is one of the smallest families in 
<tp:taxon-name>Harpacticoida</tp:taxon-name>
, but its establishment as a monophyletic group has been a long and complicated process. The history of the family began with the creation of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella
Brady 1880
</tp:taxon-name>
for 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophonte dubia
Brady &amp; Robertson 1876
</tp:taxon-name>
, and with the subsequent inclusion of that genus in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontidae Scott T. 1905</tp:taxon-name>
(
Lang 1934
). Since then, several authors have contributed importantly towards narrowing the boundaries of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontidae</tp:taxon-name>
through the removal of 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>CletopsyllusWilley 1935</tp:taxon-name>
from the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontidae</tp:taxon-name>
to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Canthocamptidae Brady 1880</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g. 
Nicholls 1941
) and trough the removal of the Donsiellinae 
Lang 1944
from the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontidae</tp:taxon-name>
to the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thalestridae 
Sars 1905</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g. Hicks 1988; Huys 1988), through the consolidation of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
as a monophyletic taxon (e.g. 
Lang 1944
, 
1948
; 
Nicholls 1945
; 
Huys &amp; Willems 1989
; Huys 1990; Huys &amp; Lee 1998; 
Lee &amp; Huys (1999)
, and proposal of new normanellid genera (e.g. 
Lee &amp; Huys 1999
; 
Kihara &amp; Huys 2009
). At present, the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
is regarded as the sister taxon of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontidae</tp:taxon-name>
and the most basal taxon of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontoidea Scott T. 1905</tp:taxon-name>
(Huys &amp; Lee 1998), and is currently composed of four genera, 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudocletodes
Scott T. &amp; Scott A. 1893
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>SagamiellaLee &amp; Huys 1999</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>ParanaiaraKihara &amp; Huys 2009</tp:taxon-name>
.

         <p>
Several laophontoidean copepods were gathered during a short-term project on the effects of organic pollution on the distribution and diversity of meiofauna from a coastal estuary in north-western 
Mexico
. The collected specimens fit the latest diagnoses for the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
by 
Lee &amp; Huys (1999)
and 
Kihara &amp; Huys (2009)
, and the diagnosis for 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
by 
Lee &amp; Huys (1999)
, except for the armature complement of P1 
EXP
3, and outer armature complement of P2–P4 
EXP
3. The inclusion of the new Mexican species into 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
would imply the expansion of the generic diagnosis of 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
, and the new material is here attributed to a new genus instead. Here we propose 
<tp:taxon-name>Arktourella</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
for the new Mexican normanellid species, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. margarethae</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
, based on maximum parsimony analysis and Bayesian inference. Also, we give some comments on the relationships amongst the genera of 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
and propose an updated key to the genera of the family.

         <p>Sample processing and taxonomy</p>
         <p>
Sediment samples were taken from ten sampling stations along Urías system, a polluted coastal system in northwestern 
Mexico
. The sediment samples were taken with an Eckman grab (sampling area 
625 cm2
). Triplicate cores were taken with acrylic tubes (sampling area 
24.6 cm2
) and the upper 
3 cm
layer of each tube was retrieved. Sediment samples were fixed in pure ethanol and sieved through 500 and 38 µm sieves. Meiofauna (the material retained in the 38 µm sieve) was extracted through centrifugation with Ludox 
®
HS-40 following Burgess (2001) and 

Rohal 
et al.
(2016)

, and preserved in pure ethanol. Meiofauna was separated manually from the fine grains of sediment using an Olympus SZX12 stereomicroscope equipped with DF PLAPO 1X objective and WHS10X eyepieces, at a magnification of 40x. Harpacticoid copepods were stored separately in 1 ml vials with pure ethanol. Illustrations and figures of the material presented herein were made from undissected individuals and dissected parts using a Leica DMLB microscope equipped with L PLAN 10X eyepieces, N PLAN 100X oil immersion objective, and drawing tube. The dissected parts were mounted on separate slides using lactophenol as mounting medium and sealed with Neo-Mount®.

         <title>Phylogenetic analyses</title>
         <p>
Fifty-nine characters were used for the phylogenetic analyses (
Table 1
). A general data matrix (Table 2) was prepared with Mesquite v. 3.61 (
Maddison &amp; Maddision 2019
; http://www.mesquiteproject.org), based on the characters lists in 
Huys &amp; Lee (1999)
and 
Kihara &amp; Huys (2009)
, and in the descriptions by 
Huys &amp; Willems (1989)
, 
Huys (1990a
, 
1990b
) and 
Lee &amp; Huys (1999)
. Oligomerization was considered the dominant trend in copepod evolution for character coding (
Huys &amp; Boxshall 1991
). Plesiomorphic character states inferred from out-group taxa were coded “0”; derived character states were coded “1” to “4” (see table 1). 
<tp:taxon-name>Canthocamptus mirabilisSterba 1968</tp:taxon-name>
as described by 
Itô &amp; Takashio (1980)
was chosen as outgroup (
Huys &amp; Lee 1999
). The position of the new genus within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontoidea</tp:taxon-name>
and within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
was assessed through a maximum parsimony analysis and Bayesian inference.
</p>
         <p>
The maximum parsimony analysis was performed using the Willi Hennig Society edition of Tree analysis using New Technology (TNT) v. 1.5 (Goloboff 
et al.
2008; Goloboff &amp; Catalano 2016). Characters were considered to be non-additive and with equal weights (default), and the collapsing rule zero was followed (any branch with a minimum possible length of 0 was eliminated); missing data and gaps were coded ‘?’. With these settings, a traditional search was carried out using tree bisection and reconnection (TBR) branch swapping of Wagner trees, with random seed set 100; random addition sequence (RAS) was 
set 1000
; trees were collapsed after the search. Photoshop was used for final editing of the trees.
</p>
         <p>
The Bayesian inference-based phylogenetic analysis was performed using MrBayes (v. 3.2.5; 

Ronquist 
et al.
2012

). All characters were unordered and with equal weights; unknown and missing data were coded as “?”; inapplicable data were coded as “–“. The analysis was performed using the default options of the program except for rates which was set gamma (rates=gamma); posterior probabilities were set 3 000 000 generations (ngen=3 000 000; with which an average standard deviation of split frequencies of 0.004 was reached) with four Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains (nchains=4) with every 100 
th
three saved (samplefreq=100), and “burn-in” was set 0.25% (burninfrac=0.25); default values were used for other parameters of the MCMC. Clades with around 95% posterior probability were accepted. A consensus tree was constructed with the “sumt” command using the “contype=allcompat” option with “burn-in” as for the MCMC. FIGTREE v.1.4.4 (
Rambaut 2018
; http://tree.bio. ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) was used to visualize and to edit the resulting tree, and Photoshop was used for final editing.

            <p>Etymology.
The generic name derives from the Greek given name Αρκτοῦρος, Arktouros (from ἄρκτος, arktos, bear, and οὖρος, ouros, guardian, meaning the Guardian of the Great Bear or Ursa Major constellation; Arktouros derived into the Latin given name Arcturus), and the Latin diminutive suffix 
-ella
. The species is dedicated to the senior author’s godfather Arturo Villanueva Robertson for his 74 
th
birthday and for his 49 
th
wedding anniversary with the senior author’s godmother Margarita Noguera Farfán. It is to be treated as a noun in the nominative singular, gender feminine.

            <p>Etymology.
The generic name derives from the Greek given name Αρκτοῦρος, Arktouros (from ἄρκτος, arktos, bear, and οὖρος, ouros, guardian, meaning the Guardian of the Great Bear or Ursa Major constellation; Arktouros derived into the Latin given name Arcturus), and the Latin diminutive suffix 
-ella
. The species is dedicated to the senior author’s godfather Arturo Villanueva Robertson for his 74 
th
birthday and for his 49 
th
wedding anniversary with the senior author’s godmother Margarita Noguera Farfán. It is to be treated as a noun in the nominative singular, gender feminine.

            <p>Etymology.
The generic name derives from the Greek given name Αρκτοῦρος, Arktouros (from ἄρκτος, arktos, bear, and οὖρος, ouros, guardian, meaning the Guardian of the Great Bear or Ursa Major constellation; Arktouros derived into the Latin given name Arcturus), and the Latin diminutive suffix 
-ella
. The species is dedicated to the senior author’s godfather Arturo Villanueva Robertson for his 74 
th
birthday and for his 49 
th
wedding anniversary with the senior author’s godmother Margarita Noguera Farfán. It is to be treated as a noun in the nominative singular, gender feminine.

The parsimony analysis yielded two equally parsimonious trees (

the most basal family and the sister taxon of

. The superfamily was supported by a high bootstrap value (100%) (

); the Laophontidae-Cristacoxidae clade (see

         <p>Historical background</p>
         <p>
The history of the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
can be traced back to the creation of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
by Brady (1880) to reallocate 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophonte dubia</tp:taxon-name>
. He (Brady 1880) placed 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
in his newly proposed subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Cathocamptinae Brady 1880</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Lang (1934)
included 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
into the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontidae</tp:taxon-name>
, but 
Monard (1935a)
believed that 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
was not related to 
<tp:taxon-name>LaophontePhilippi 1840</tp:taxon-name>
, but to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Canthocamptidae</tp:taxon-name>
¸ and proposed to allocate 
<tp:taxon-name>Mesochra minuta
Boeck 1872
</tp:taxon-name>
(= 
<tp:taxon-name>N. minuta
(Boeck 1872))
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>N. mucronataSars 1909</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>N. tenuifurcaSars 1909</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>N. incertaLang 1934</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>N. quartaMonard 1935b</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>N. semiticaMonard 1935a</tp:taxon-name>
in a separate subfamily for which he did not give a name nor a diagnosis. In an attempt to narrow the boundaries of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Laophontidae, 
Nicholls (1941)</tp:taxon-name>
believed that 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
occupied an intermediate position between the 
<tp:taxon-name>Cletodidae Scott T. 1905</tp:taxon-name>
and the 
<tp:taxon-name>Canthocamptidae</tp:taxon-name>
, and proposed to remove 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Cletopsyllus</tp:taxon-name>
from the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontidae</tp:taxon-name>
and to reallocate them into the 
<tp:taxon-name>Canthocamptidae</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Lang (1944)
did not follow Nicholls’ (1941) view and subdivided the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontidae</tp:taxon-name>
into three subfamilies, Laophontinae 
Lang 1944
, Donsiellinae 
Lang 1944
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellinae</tp:taxon-name>Lang 1944
, the latter for 
<tp:taxon-name>Cleta
Claus 1863
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cletopsyllus</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>PseudocletaLang 1944</tp:taxon-name>
. Probably unaware of 
Lang’s (1944)
proposal of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellinae</tp:taxon-name>
, and inspired in the similarity of the first leg of 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Cletopsyllus</tp:taxon-name>
noted by 
Willey (1935)
, 
Nicholls (1945)
proposed and diagnosed the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
for 
<tp:taxon-name>Cletopsyllus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Lang (1948)
did not add Nicholls’ (1945) paper in his monograph, and followed his own scheme of 1944 regarding the subdivision of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontidae</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Lang (1948)
believed that 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Cletopsyllus</tp:taxon-name>
are closely related, and that 
<tp:taxon-name>Cleta</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudocleta</tp:taxon-name>
can be regarded as more specialized forms within 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
. The Donsiellinae was recognized as the closest relative of the Pseudotachidiinae 
Lang 1936
and was reallocated into the 
<tp:taxon-name>Thalestridae</tp:taxon-name>
(Hicks 1988; Huys 1988). At the time of publication of 
Lang’s (1948)
monograph, the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellinae</tp:taxon-name>
included the genera 
<tp:taxon-name>Cleta</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudocleta</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Cletopsyllus</tp:taxon-name>
. The taxonomic concept of the subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellinae</tp:taxon-name>
was revised by 
Huys &amp; Willems (1989)
who proposed the family 
<tp:taxon-name>
Laophontopsidae 
Huys &amp; Willems 1989</tp:taxon-name>
for 
<tp:taxon-name>LaophontopsisSars 1908</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>AculeopsisHuys &amp; Willems 1989</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>TelodocusHuys &amp; Willems 1989</tp:taxon-name>
, and revised 
Lang’s (1948)
subdivision of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellinae</tp:taxon-name>
into the 
<tp:taxon-name>Cleta</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
groups on the basis of the armature of P1 and P2 
ENP
. As a result, they (
Huys &amp; Willems 1989
) upgraded provisionally the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellinae</tp:taxon-name>
to family level to further narrow the diagnosis of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontidae</tp:taxon-name>
, and subdivided the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
into two subfamilies, 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellinae</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
) and Cletopsyllinae 
Huys &amp; Willems 1989
(
<tp:taxon-name>Cletopsyllus</tp:taxon-name>
–
<tp:taxon-name>PseudocletopsyllusVervoort 1964</tp:taxon-name>
; the latter considered as 
incertae sedis
within the Cletopsyllinae), and relegated 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudocleta</tp:taxon-name>
to 
incertae sedis
within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontoidea</tp:taxon-name>
. At this point, 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
(with 13 species, and one species inquirenda) was the only genus within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Normanellidae (
Huys &amp; Willems 1989
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. One year later, Huys (1990) gave a list of apomorphies for the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontoidea</tp:taxon-name>
, excluded the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Cletopsyllidae</tp:taxon-name>
from that superfamily, and recognized the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontidae</tp:taxon-name>
as the first offshoot within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontoidea</tp:taxon-name>
. Huys &amp; Lee (1998) re-assessed the phylogenetic relationships of the families of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontoidea</tp:taxon-name>
and noted that the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
actually bears a sister-group relationship with the other laophontoidean genera as evidenced by several synapomorphies (Huys &amp; Lee 1998: 270–271), and re-incorporated the former into the latter. Additionally, Huys &amp; Lee (1998) relegated the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudocletopsyllus</tp:taxon-name>
as 
genus inquirendum
, and formally gave full family rank to Cletopsyllinae. In their review of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella,Lee &amp; Huys (1999)</tp:taxon-name>
recognized five evolutionary lineages within the genus, and created the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Sagamiella</tp:taxon-name>
for 
<tp:taxon-name>S. latirostrataLee &amp; Huys 1999</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>S. aberrans
(
Bodin 1968
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. More recently, 
Kihara &amp; Huys (2009)
added the monotypic genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Paranaiara</tp:taxon-name>
, removed 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudocletodes</tp:taxon-name>
from the 
<tp:taxon-name>Nannopodidae Brady 1880</tp:taxon-name>
and reallocated it into the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
, and presented an amended diagnosis for the latter family. At this point, the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
included the 
type
genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanella</tp:taxon-name>
(18 valid species;

was attributed to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Laophontoidea</tp:taxon-name>
and to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
in particular on account of the lack of outer spinous processes on the second antennulary segment, antennary allobasis with one abexopodal seta, one-segmented antennary exopod armed with four setae, P1 
ENP
two-segmented with elongate 
ENP
1 and with two distal elements on 
ENP
2, two-segmented P2–P4 endopods, distal setae on the male P2 
ENP
2 and P3 
ENP

ENP
2 fused to segment (the two latter autapomorphic for 
<tp:taxon-name>Normanellidae</tp:taxon-name>
; 
Lee &amp; Huys 1999
). However, the Mexican specimens could not be attributed to any of the known normanellid genera due to the presence of four elements on the P1 
EXP

            <p>Etymology.
The generic name derives from the Greek given name Αρκτοῦρος, Arktouros (from ἄρκτος, arktos, bear, and οὖρος, ouros, guardian, meaning the Guardian of the Great Bear or Ursa Major constellation; Arktouros derived into the Latin given name Arcturus), and the Latin diminutive suffix 
-ella
. The species is dedicated to the senior author’s godfather Arturo Villanueva Robertson for his 74 
th
birthday and for his 49 
th
wedding anniversary with the senior author’s godmother Margarita Noguera Farfán. It is to be treated as a noun in the nominative singular, gender feminine.
