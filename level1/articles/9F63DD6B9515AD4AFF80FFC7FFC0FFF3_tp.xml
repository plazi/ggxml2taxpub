In this study, four new Brazilian species are described for the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>AdelosgryllusMesa &amp; Zefa, 2004</tp:taxon-name>
, occurring in 
Minas Gerais
, 
Tocantins
and 
Pará
states. Three of these species were found in caves and one was found in endogenous habitats, representing the first record of species form this genus for such habitats. The morphology of the phallic complex was used as the main criterion for distinguishing the new species, the copulatory papilla was also described for one of the new species. Finally, we bring a brief discussion about the ecology, distribution, and conservation of these species.

The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>AdelosgryllusMesa &amp; Zefa, 2004</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Orthoptera</tp:taxon-name>
: 
<tp:taxon-name>Phalangopsidae</tp:taxon-name>
:Adelosgryllina) presents seven described species (

Cigliano 
et al.
, 2021

), namely: 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus rubricephalusMesa &amp; Zefa, 2004</tp:taxon-name>
, from 
Paraná state
, southern 
Brazil
; 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus spuriusGorochov, 2011</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus phaeocephalusGorochov 2011</tp:taxon-name>
, from the Atalaya Province, 
Peru
; 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus similis
Corrêa &amp; Zefa, 2018
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus cruscastaneus
Corrêa &amp; Zefa, 2018
</tp:taxon-name>
, from 
Ceará state
, northeastern 
Brazil
; 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus parasimilisGorochov, 2019</tp:taxon-name>
, from the Province of Satipo, 
Peru
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus lucifugus
Merlo 
et al.
, 2021
</tp:taxon-name>
, from 
Piauí state
, northeastern 
Brazil
. The genus exhibits a discontinuous geographic distribution along different biomes (e.g., Amazon Forest, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado and Caatinga) and South American countries (e.g., 
Brazil
and 
Peru
) (

Cigliano 
et al.
, 2021

; 

Merlo 
et al.
, 2021

). Therefore, the few observations portrayed in the literature and the small number of species described so far may eventually indicate that several species still await to be discovered.
</p>
         <p>
Species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus</tp:taxon-name>
, like many other phalangopsids, are nocturnal and can be found in humid forests, leaf litter, holes and crevices in the ground, under fallen logs, rodent burrows, termite mounds, caves, and some places close to urban areas (
Mesa &amp; Zefa, 2004
; 
Gorochov, 2011
; 
Corrêa, 2017
; 

Corrêa 
et al.
, 2018

; 
Gorochov, 2019
; 

Merlo 
et al.
, 2021

).
</p>
         <p>
Due to their dark color and small size (e.g., ~ 
8 mm
– 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus rubricephalusMesa &amp; Zefa, 2004</tp:taxon-name>
; ~ 
7.8 mm
– 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus spurius
Gorocov, 2011
</tp:taxon-name>
; ~ 
12.8 mm
– 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus lucifugus
Merlo 
et al.
, 2021
</tp:taxon-name>
), the detection of these organisms in nature is difficult. Therefore, the actual number of species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus</tp:taxon-name>
is probably underestimated. However, after analyzing specimens sampled in cave environments in the recent years in 
Brazil
, we detected new records for the genus, bringing new information about the distribution and taxonomy of this group, still poorly studied.
</p>
         <p>
Thus, in the present study, we describe four new species for the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>AdelosgryllusMesa &amp; Zefa, 2004</tp:taxon-name>
, of which three occur in caves and the fourth is associated with endogenous habitats (SSH - Shallow subterranean habitats), representing the first record of species from the genus in such habitats. Additionally, we discuss aspects of the ecology, distribution and conservation of the new species.

         <p>Study area</p>
         <p>
All the species described in this work were collected in 
Brazil
. The first species was collected in the caverna da Explosão Cave located in Xambioá municipality, 
Tocantins state
, Northern 
Brazil
(

, white star). The cave is associated to metamorphosed limestones from the Xambioá formation (

Auler 
et al.
, 2019

). Such region belongs to the Amazon Forest biome domain (

Olson 
et al.
, 2001

).
</p>
         <p>
The second species was collected on 
Pará state
, municipality of Curionópolis, in SL-94, SL-109 and SL-110 caves (

, black star) with additional specimens observed in SL-79, SL-82 and SL-121 caves, all inserted in the ferruginous region of Carajás. The predominant biome in the region is the Amazon Forest (

Olson 
et al.
, 2001

).
</p>
         <p>
The third and fourth species were collected in 
Minas Gerais state
, being one of them observed in Conceição do Mato Dentro municipality, in Resgate cave (

, water-green star). This cave is inserted in the Espinhaço Supergroup and the main biome is the Atlantic Forest. The fourth species was found in the Pains municipality, and it is associated to endogenous habitats. Specimens were sampled through subterranean traps installed near one cave (

, purple star). The area is inserted within the Bambuí carbonate group, and represents an ecotonal area between the Cerrado (Brazilian Savannah) and the Atlantic Forest domains.
</p>
         <p>Collection and examination</p>
         <p>
The specimens were collected by active searching inside the caves, except for the endogenous species found in Pains municipality, which was sampled with subterranean traps with a solution of 4% formalin as described by 
Rendoš (2012)
. Immediately after collection, the specimens were fixed in an aqueous solution of 70% ethanol. In the laboratory, the phallic sclerites and copulatory papilla were dissected. After dissection, the phallic complex was treated with an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide (
KOH
) at a concentration of 10% for 10 minutes, to remove membranous and muscular tissues. The phallic sclerites and copulatory papilla of each specimen were stored in vials containing 70% aqueous solution of ethanol with the other parts of the specimen. For measurements and photographs an Axion Zoom V16 (ZEISS) stereomicroscope were utilized.
</p>
         <p>
The nomenclature used to describe the male phallic sclerites and copulatory papilla were based on 
Desutter (1987
, 
1988
), modified by 
Desutter-Grandcolas (2003)
and the terminology used by Corrêa 
et al.
, (2018).

Leg III: same appearance as legs I and II, femur developed, whitish towards proximal region, articulation between femur and tibia with a reddish-brown color with black spots at basilateral inner and outer regions, distal portion brownish; tibia slightly brownish, with three inner (SS Int., 

) and three outer subapical spurs (SS Ext., 

), and four inner (d, e, f, and g, 

) and three outer apical spurs (a, b, and c, 

), first tarsomere developed with two apical spurs, inner slightly bigger than outer (

). 
Right tegmen.
Light brown, covering the first four abdominal tergites (

). 
Lateral field
(in lateral view, 

and

M
and 
R

1A
, 
2A
and curbital 2 (
Cu2
) well marked; 
Cu2*
modified in stridulatory file; harp with a median-longitudinal vein (
L
), and three crossed veins (
Hcv
), forming four well demarked cells, connecting 
Cu2*
towards the lateral field, the first two external veins crossing 
L
; mirror triangular oval, with one crossed vein (
Mcv
) connected to a distal cross vein in the opposite orientation, 
Mcv
with a poorly marked vertical upper branch, one cell distal is present below the 
Cu2
; stridulatory file with 92 teeth. 
Abdomen.
tergites pubescent, light brown and slightly darkened dorsally (

); sternites pubescent, slightly whiter than the tergites and with a pattern of dark spots above the light brown spot in the most central region of each sternite (

); subgenital plate pubescent, light brown and slightly darkened towards the side edges, distal and side margin with long bristles, quadrangular shape, distal central region with a slightly indentation (

); supra-anal plate pubescent, darkened throughout the structure than subgenital plate, trapezoidal shaped, with small lateral projections, distal portion rounded and with long bristles (

Specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus ferratilis</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were found in Curionópolis municipality, 
Pará state
, 
Brazil
. The caves where specimens were observed are located in an area regionally known as “Serra Leste”. This area presents several iron-ore caves, but also some quartzite caves. The species was observed in several caves in the area, especially those ferruginous. Such caves are usually small (few dozens of meters) and several cavities only comprises rock shelters, without aphotic areas. The main organic resources observed in those caves is the bat guano and vegetable organic debris, deposited by wind or water. Although the area was originally covered by a tropical rainforest (Amazon rainforest), it is currently highly impacted, by both the replacement of the forests by pastures and by mining activities. The populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ferratilis</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
are usually small inside the caves, so that the species may use the caves only sporadically. However, since the external environments were not sampled, it is currently impossible to establish the actual distribution of this species (

).

The single observed specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus xambioa</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
was found in the Explosão cave, which is a marble cave with 1203 meters of horizontal projection. A quarry that used to remove marble from the outcrop led to the collapse of the main cave entrance. Therefore, in order to access the cave, one should enter through a small opening located at the base of the outcrop, leading to a very narrow passage (

). The floor along most part of the cave is covered with sediments (

), although a few fallen blocks are also present. The organic resources in the cave are especially bat guano produced by several bat species although deposits produced by hematophagous bats are the most common. Additionally, vegetal debris transported by water during strong rains also occur in some areas. The cave is devoid of any regular water flow, but several areas can be partially flooded during the rainy period. The single collected specimen was observed freely walking on the cave floor (

), close to a guano pile. It is important to mention that the cave was not entirely surveyed during our sampling, since a flashflood occurred forcing the team to quickly leave the cave. Accordingly, there is no information regarding the size of the species’ population and its density inside the cave. The region presents a climate Aw5 (according to the Köppen classification system), with an average annual precipitation of 
1558 mm
and an average annual temperature of 26.3ºC. The external area is altered, especially due to the removal of the natural vegetation and its replacement by 
<tp:taxon-name>Eucalyptus</tp:taxon-name>
plantations. However, secondary forest surrounds the outcrop where the cave is located. As for the other species herein described, the epigean environments surrounding the cave were not sampled, so it is currently impossible to determine the habitat preference for this species. It is important to mention that despite the fact that the species was only found inside a cave, it does not exhibit any troglomorphic traits, thus not being a cave-restricted species. Since the external area was not sample, it is likely that the species’ distribution is much wider than currently known.

Specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus endogeus</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were found in Pains municipality, 
Minas Gerais state
, 
Brazil
. The individuals were sampled by a set of subterranean traps buried in the soil, installed to collect surface subterranean fauna. These traps consist of plastic pots interconnected by a central rod (

) and introduced into PVC pipes with perforations every 
10 cm
. Each set of perforations in the pipes allow only the organisms from each stratum to fall into each pot, as each pot is internally coupled to the pipe in order to prevent access to the other levels. At each sampling point, three sets of traps were installed (

), totaling thirty collection pots per point (three pots at each level, starting at 
5 cm
and along the area, always in places close to cave entrances. The traps were inspected monthly, when the contents (4% formalin containing the collected invertebrates) were removed and replaced. Along the 12 months of the project, 2,160 samples of different depth were obtained. Even with this sampling effort, only 
two specimens
of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. endogeus</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were collected, both at the same point (

). The 
holotype
(male) was the first to be collected, between 
April and May 2021
. As the traps remained in the field for about a month, it is not possible to determine the exact date of collection. The female was sampled in the next interval, in the exact location of the male. Both specimens were trapped at 
45 cm
deep in the soil (

). It is interesting noting that although many caves in the area have been sampled along the last is important karstic province years, specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. endogeus</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were never observed, thus suggesting that they might be preferably associated to soil interstitials. The reduced size of this species (which is smaller than all the congeners) corroborate this hypothesis, although it is also important to conduct samplings in other epigean substrates in the area in order to determine the distribution of this species.

               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were found in Curionópolis municipality, 
Pará state
, 
Brazil
. The caves where specimens were observed are located in an area regionally known as “Serra Leste”. This area presents several iron-ore caves, but also some quartzite caves. The species was observed in several caves in the area, especially those ferruginous. Such caves are usually small (few dozens of meters) and several cavities only comprises rock shelters, without aphotic areas. The main organic resources observed in those caves is the bat guano and vegetable organic debris, deposited by wind or water. Although the area was originally covered by a tropical rainforest (Amazon rainforest), it is currently highly impacted, by both the replacement of the forests by pastures and by mining activities. The populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ferratilis</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
are usually small inside the caves, so that the species may use the caves only sporadically. However, since the external environments were not sampled, it is currently impossible to establish the actual distribution of this species (

).

The single observed specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus xambioa</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
was found in the Explosão cave, which is a marble cave with 1203 meters of horizontal projection. A quarry that used to remove marble from the outcrop led to the collapse of the main cave entrance. Therefore, in order to access the cave, one should enter through a small opening located at the base of the outcrop, leading to a very narrow passage (

). The floor along most part of the cave is covered with sediments (

), although a few fallen blocks are also present. The organic resources in the cave are especially bat guano produced by several bat species although deposits produced by hematophagous bats are the most common. Additionally, vegetal debris transported by water during strong rains also occur in some areas. The cave is devoid of any regular water flow, but several areas can be partially flooded during the rainy period. The single collected specimen was observed freely walking on the cave floor (

), close to a guano pile. It is important to mention that the cave was not entirely surveyed during our sampling, since a flashflood occurred forcing the team to quickly leave the cave. Accordingly, there is no information regarding the size of the species’ population and its density inside the cave. The region presents a climate Aw5 (according to the Köppen classification system), with an average annual precipitation of 
1558 mm
and an average annual temperature of 26.3ºC. The external area is altered, especially due to the removal of the natural vegetation and its replacement by 
<tp:taxon-name>Eucalyptus</tp:taxon-name>
plantations. However, secondary forest surrounds the outcrop where the cave is located. As for the other species herein described, the epigean environments surrounding the cave were not sampled, so it is currently impossible to determine the habitat preference for this species. It is important to mention that despite the fact that the species was only found inside a cave, it does not exhibit any troglomorphic traits, thus not being a cave-restricted species. Since the external area was not sample, it is likely that the species’ distribution is much wider than currently known.

            <p>
Since the specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus megapterus</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were not collected by any of the authors of this study, there is no information regarding its habitat preferences. However, as for other species herein described, despite the fact that the species was only found inside a cave, it does not exhibit any troglomorphic traits, thus not being a caverestricted species. Accordingly, it is likely that the species’ distribution is much wider than currently known.

Specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus endogeus</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were found in Pains municipality, 
Minas Gerais state
, 
Brazil
. The individuals were sampled by a set of subterranean traps buried in the soil, installed to collect surface subterranean fauna. These traps consist of plastic pots interconnected by a central rod (

) and introduced into PVC pipes with perforations every 
10 cm
. Each set of perforations in the pipes allow only the organisms from each stratum to fall into each pot, as each pot is internally coupled to the pipe in order to prevent access to the other levels. At each sampling point, three sets of traps were installed (

), totaling thirty collection pots per point (three pots at each level, starting at 
5 cm
and along the area, always in places close to cave entrances. The traps were inspected monthly, when the contents (4% formalin containing the collected invertebrates) were removed and replaced. Along the 12 months of the project, 2,160 samples of different depth were obtained. Even with this sampling effort, only 
two specimens
of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. endogeus</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were collected, both at the same point (

). The 
holotype
(male) was the first to be collected, between 
April and May 2021
. As the traps remained in the field for about a month, it is not possible to determine the exact date of collection. The female was sampled in the next interval, in the exact location of the male. Both specimens were trapped at 
45 cm
deep in the soil (

). It is interesting noting that although many caves in the area have been sampled along the last is important karstic province years, specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. endogeus</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were never observed, thus suggesting that they might be preferably associated to soil interstitials. The reduced size of this species (which is smaller than all the congeners) corroborate this hypothesis, although it is also important to conduct samplings in other epigean substrates in the area in order to determine the distribution of this species.

. The caves where specimens were observed are located in an area regionally known as “Serra Leste”. This area presents several iron-ore caves, but also some quartzite caves. The species was observed in several caves in the area, especially those ferruginous. Such caves are usually small (few dozens of meters) and several cavities only comprises rock shelters, without aphotic areas. The main organic resources observed in those caves is the bat guano and vegetable organic debris, deposited by wind or water. Although the area was originally covered by a tropical rainforest (Amazon rainforest), it is currently highly impacted, by both the replacement of the forests by pastures and by mining activities. The populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ferratilis</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
are usually small inside the caves, so that the species may use the caves only sporadically. However, since the external environments were not sampled, it is currently impossible to establish the actual distribution of this species (

The single observed specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus xambioa</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
was found in the Explosão cave, which is a marble cave with 1203 meters of horizontal projection. A quarry that used to remove marble from the outcrop led to the collapse of the main cave entrance. Therefore, in order to access the cave, one should enter through a small opening located at the base of the outcrop, leading to a very narrow passage (

). The floor along most part of the cave is covered with sediments (

), although a few fallen blocks are also present. The organic resources in the cave are especially bat guano produced by several bat species although deposits produced by hematophagous bats are the most common. Additionally, vegetal debris transported by water during strong rains also occur in some areas. The cave is devoid of any regular water flow, but several areas can be partially flooded during the rainy period. The single collected specimen was observed freely walking on the cave floor (

), close to a guano pile. It is important to mention that the cave was not entirely surveyed during our sampling, since a flashflood occurred forcing the team to quickly leave the cave. Accordingly, there is no information regarding the size of the species’ population and its density inside the cave. The region presents a climate Aw5 (according to the Köppen classification system), with an average annual precipitation of 
1558 mm
and an average annual temperature of 26.3ºC. The external area is altered, especially due to the removal of the natural vegetation and its replacement by 
<tp:taxon-name>Eucalyptus</tp:taxon-name>
plantations. However, secondary forest surrounds the outcrop where the cave is located. As for the other species herein described, the epigean environments surrounding the cave were not sampled, so it is currently impossible to determine the habitat preference for this species. It is important to mention that despite the fact that the species was only found inside a cave, it does not exhibit any troglomorphic traits, thus not being a cave-restricted species. Since the external area was not sample, it is likely that the species’ distribution is much wider than currently known.

5 cm

<tp:taxon-name>A. endogeus</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were collected, both at the same point (

). The 
holotype
(male) was the first to be collected, between 
April and May 2021
. As the traps remained in the field for about a month, it is not possible to determine the exact date of collection. The female was sampled in the next interval, in the exact location of the male. Both specimens were trapped at 
45 cm
deep in the soil (

). It is interesting noting that although many caves in the area have been sampled along the last is important karstic province years, specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. endogeus</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were never observed, thus suggesting that they might be preferably associated to soil interstitials. The reduced size of this species (which is smaller than all the congeners) corroborate this hypothesis, although it is also important to conduct samplings in other epigean substrates in the area in order to determine the distribution of this species.

Specimens of

               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were found in Curionópolis municipality, 
Pará state
, 
Brazil
. The caves where specimens were observed are located in an area regionally known as “Serra Leste”. This area presents several iron-ore caves, but also some quartzite caves. The species was observed in several caves in the area, especially those ferruginous. Such caves are usually small (few dozens of meters) and several cavities only comprises rock shelters, without aphotic areas. The main organic resources observed in those caves is the bat guano and vegetable organic debris, deposited by wind or water. Although the area was originally covered by a tropical rainforest (Amazon rainforest), it is currently highly impacted, by both the replacement of the forests by pastures and by mining activities. The populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ferratilis</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
are usually small inside the caves, so that the species may use the caves only sporadically. However, since the external environments were not sampled, it is currently impossible to establish the actual distribution of this species (

).

The single observed specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus xambioa</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
was found in the Explosão cave, which is a marble cave with 1203 meters of horizontal projection. A quarry that used to remove marble from the outcrop led to the collapse of the main cave entrance. Therefore, in order to access the cave, one should enter through a small opening located at the base of the outcrop, leading to a very narrow passage (

). The floor along most part of the cave is covered with sediments (

), although a few fallen blocks are also present. The organic resources in the cave are especially bat guano produced by several bat species although deposits produced by hematophagous bats are the most common. Additionally, vegetal debris transported by water during strong rains also occur in some areas. The cave is devoid of any regular water flow, but several areas can be partially flooded during the rainy period. The single collected specimen was observed freely walking on the cave floor (

), close to a guano pile. It is important to mention that the cave was not entirely surveyed during our sampling, since a flashflood occurred forcing the team to quickly leave the cave. Accordingly, there is no information regarding the size of the species’ population and its density inside the cave. The region presents a climate Aw5 (according to the Köppen classification system), with an average annual precipitation of 
1558 mm
and an average annual temperature of 26.3ºC. The external area is altered, especially due to the removal of the natural vegetation and its replacement by 
<tp:taxon-name>Eucalyptus</tp:taxon-name>
plantations. However, secondary forest surrounds the outcrop where the cave is located. As for the other species herein described, the epigean environments surrounding the cave were not sampled, so it is currently impossible to determine the habitat preference for this species. It is important to mention that despite the fact that the species was only found inside a cave, it does not exhibit any troglomorphic traits, thus not being a cave-restricted species. Since the external area was not sample, it is likely that the species’ distribution is much wider than currently known.

Since the specimens of

               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were not collected by any of the authors of this study, there is no information regarding its habitat preferences. However, as for other species herein described, despite the fact that the species was only found inside a cave, it does not exhibit any troglomorphic traits, thus not being a caverestricted species. Accordingly, it is likely that the species’ distribution is much wider than currently known.

Specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus endogeus</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were found in Pains municipality, 
Minas Gerais state
, 
Brazil
. The individuals were sampled by a set of subterranean traps buried in the soil, installed to collect surface subterranean fauna. These traps consist of plastic pots interconnected by a central rod (

) and introduced into PVC pipes with perforations every 
10 cm
. Each set of perforations in the pipes allow only the organisms from each stratum to fall into each pot, as each pot is internally coupled to the pipe in order to prevent access to the other levels. At each sampling point, three sets of traps were installed (

), totaling thirty collection pots per point (three pots at each level, starting at 
5 cm
and along the area, always in places close to cave entrances. The traps were inspected monthly, when the contents (4% formalin containing the collected invertebrates) were removed and replaced. Along the 12 months of the project, 2,160 samples of different depth were obtained. Even with this sampling effort, only 
two specimens
of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. endogeus</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were collected, both at the same point (

). The 
holotype
(male) was the first to be collected, between 
April and May 2021
. As the traps remained in the field for about a month, it is not possible to determine the exact date of collection. The female was sampled in the next interval, in the exact location of the male. Both specimens were trapped at 
45 cm
deep in the soil (

). It is interesting noting that although many caves in the area have been sampled along the last is important karstic province years, specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. endogeus</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
were never observed, thus suggesting that they might be preferably associated to soil interstitials. The reduced size of this species (which is smaller than all the congeners) corroborate this hypothesis, although it is also important to conduct samplings in other epigean substrates in the area in order to determine the distribution of this species.

, which apparently retained the original coloration, were firstly fixed in formalin 4% (conservative solution used in the traps), and later in 70% ethanol, so that this fixative may have prevented discoloration; however, better investigations are needed in order to confirm or refute this.

         <p>
From this study, it is possible to group the 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus
species
</tp:taxon-name>
(based on male adults) into three distinct groups, taking into account the morphology of the phallic complex. The first group is formed by the species 
<tp:taxon-name>A. spurius</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. lucifugus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ferratilis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. xambioa</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>A. megapterus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
, which present a quadrangularshaped phallic complex, highlighted mainly by the presence of a paramere 1 of pseudepiphallus C-shaped (Ps.P1), analogous to a “hook”, with the median pseudepiphalic lophy (Ps.m.l) claviform and thin. The second group is formed by the species 
<tp:taxon-name>A. parasimilis</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. similis</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. cruscastaneus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>A. endogeus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
, which present a vertically elongated phallic complex of rectangular shape, highlighted by the presence of parameres 1 and 2 forming a lenticular structure, with the median pseudepiphalic lophi (Ps.m.l) developed and extended. Finally, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. rubricephalus</tp:taxon-name>
compose an isolated group, with a quadrangular-shaped phallic complex, highlighted mainly by the presence of the paramere 1 narrow in dorsal and ventral view, with the median pseudepiphalic lophy (Ps.m.l) slightly developed compared to the first two groups.
</p>
         <p>
The female copulatory papilla is still unknown for most species of this genus, being only known to four species. In two of them (
<tp:taxon-name>A. rubricephalus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>A. cruscastaneus</tp:taxon-name>
) it presents a square shape, while in the other two species (
<tp:taxon-name>A. lucifugus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>A. megapterus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
) it presents a circular shape.
</p>
         <p>
While describing the species 
<tp:taxon-name>A. rubricephalus
, 
Mesa and Zefa (2004)</tp:taxon-name>
detected the presence of a pair of well-developed hindwings in 
three females
found in Iguaçu, 
Paraná state
, 
Brazil
. In addition, 
Corrêa (2017)
also documented this morphology in a female collected in the Iguaçu National Park, 
Paraná state
, 
Brazil
. Until then, the presence of well-developed hindwings was unknown for adult males of this genus. However, in this study, we observed a male of the species 
<tp:taxon-name>A. megapterus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
with such morphology. Although still speculative, these well-developed wings occurring in some individuals of certain species may eventually contribute to their dispersal. However, future studies should be developed on this topic to confirm or refute this hypothesis.
</p>
         <p>
It is important to highlight that, in recent years, new localities have been recorded for the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Adelosgryllus</tp:taxon-name>
(https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?taxon_id=765973) in 
Brazil
(
Acre
, 
Mato Grosso
, 
Minas Gerais
, 
Rio de Janeiro
and 
Paraná
states), 
Argentina
(
Misiones
, 
Chaco
and González Moreno provinces) and 
Bolivia
(Sara province), from records shared on the citizen science platform Inaturalist (iNaturalist, 2022). It should be noted that in some of these records it is possible to observe specimens with well-developed hindwings, which reinforces the eventual dispersive function of these structures, especially when considering the wide geographic distribution that these small crickets may present.
</p>
         <p>
The new species of 
<tp:taxon-name>AdelosgryllusMesa &amp; Zefa, 2004</tp:taxon-name>
described in this work, from four different regions of the 
Brazil
, reveal the great potential for the discovery of new species of this genus, which is still little known. Furthermore, the new species found in interstitial habitats (
<tp:taxon-name>A. endogeus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
)

reveals the diversity of habitats capable of being used by these organisms. Finally, the importance of preserving caves is highlighted, since three of the species herein described were found in such environments. It is crucial to preserve the habitats of these species, so that future studies can be carried out, in order to better understand aspects of the ecology and distribution of this species, as well as its relationships with the several subterranean habitats where they occur.
