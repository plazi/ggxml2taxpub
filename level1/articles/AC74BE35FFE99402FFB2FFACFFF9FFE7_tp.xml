The species 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus
(
Verhoeffiella
) 
absoloni
Kseneman, 
1938</tp:taxon-name>
is redescribed in detail and characterized by its barcode, based on specimens from its 
type
locality in 
Montenegro
. A 
neotype
is designated. Dorsal S-chaetotaxy is given for the first time in the subgenus 
<tp:taxon-name>Verhoeffiella</tp:taxon-name>
. Chaeta morphology and distribution are thoroughly analyzed, in particular on antennae where 
12
chaetal 
types
are recognized. Several morphological features are newly described for the genus and for Heteromurinae. The widely disjunct distribution of the species is approached through morphological and molecular comparison of specimens from the 
type
locality in 
Montenegro
and from the Catalan population. We established that this last record is a new species described here as 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus

Verhoeffiella
)

A table of all species of the subgenus is provided. The taxonomic status of

         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Verhoeffiella
Absolon, 
1900</tp:taxon-name>
is a subgenus of 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus
Wankel, 
1860</tp:taxon-name>
(considered as a full genus by Soto- Adames 
et al
. 
2008
) which includes 
9
troglomorphic species. They are present in several European karst areas: Balkans (Dinarids, 
Macedonia
) (
7
species), southeastern Italian Alps (one species), southern Catalonia (one species) and Cordillera Cantabrica (two species) in 
Spain
, and Northeastern 
France
(one species). In some areas (e.g. Dinarids) these species count among the dominant cave invertebrates in subterranean communities (

Lukić &amp; Deharveng, 
2008
) while in the Iberian Peninsula they are only known from a few caves (

Jordana 
et al
. 
1990
). No species has ever been recorded from intermediate regions (particularly Western Alps, southern Massif Central and the Pyrenees), a disjunct pattern extremely intriguing from a biogeographical and evolutionary point of view. Moreover, the species reported from Catalonia and Cordillera Cantabrica in 
Spain
by 

Gama (
1984
)

and from Northeastern 
France
by 

Thibaud (
1970
)

have been considered by these authors conspecific with three Dinaric species, 
<tp:taxon-name>H.
(
V.
) 
absoloni
Kseneman, 
1938</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H
. (
V.
) 
longicornis
(

Absolon, 
1900
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H.
(
V.
) 
cavicola
Absolon, 
1900</tp:taxon-name>
. Such a situation would probably represent the most extreme case of disjunct distribution among terrestrial troglomorphic species in Europe.
</p>
         <p>
In spite of spectacular morphological modifications of several species in relation to cave life and the puzzling distribution pattern of the subgenus summarized above, 
<tp:taxon-name>Verhoeffiella</tp:taxon-name>
has never been the subject of detailed morphological study, and the available descriptions remain basic. This may be due to the fact that chaetotaxic patterns widely used to separate species in 
<tp:taxon-name>Entomobryidae</tp:taxon-name>
are of little help in 
<tp:taxon-name>Verhoeffiella</tp:taxon-name>
. Having collected a large number of specimens and species from several Dinaric caves, we initiate in the present paper a review of the subgenus with two objectives. First, to re-describe in detail 
<tp:taxon-name>H.
(
V.
) 
absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
and to set a reference descriptive framework for species of the subgenus, that are all very poorly described. Second, to compare specimens from the 
type
locality in 
Montenegro
with specimens of the Catalan locality from where it was recorded in 
1984
by Gama.
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus
(
Verhoeffiella
) 
absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
was described in 
1938
by Kseneman from a cave of 
Montenegro
(pećina Golodražnica), and is only known from this locality within the Dinarids. The original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>H
. (
V
.) 
absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
was extremely succinct, lacking most characters used in modern taxonomy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Entomobryidae</tp:taxon-name>
. The extensive re-description of the species given here is based on fresh material collected in the 
type
locality, using modern chaetotaxic and mouthpart characters. A special emphasis is put on the diversity of chaetae, especially on antenna that has been only partially studied so far in the literature (

Bonet, 
1931
), whereas it might be a rich mine of new character for the taxonomy of the Heteromurinae 
sensu
Zhang &amp; Deharveng (
2015
)

where chaetotaxic patterns seem to be very uniform within the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
Forat del Rastre, a cave in southern Catalonia 
1500 km
from the Dinarid locality, is the second locality from where 
<tp:taxon-name>H.
(
V.
) 
absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
has been recorded (

Gama 
1984
). Such a wide disjunction in geographical distribution is an unusual case among troglobiotic arthropods, raising the question of identification accuracy of the Catalan species in a group where interspecific discriminant characters are all considered as adaptive. We compare here specimens from this Catalan cave with topotypical specimens, using morphological and barcoding approaches.

. The deposition of the 
type
specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus
(
Verhoeffiella

absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
is not mentioned in the original description, and it has been impossible to locate them in regional Museum. We relied upon fresh specimens collected by hand in the 
type
locality, among which a 
neotype
was designated. For the Spanish record of the species, we used specimens collected in Forat del Rastre in the Mola de Cati range (Tarragona, Catalonia), the only locality where the species has been recorded in 
Spain
.

         <p>Formulae
. Formulae are given per half tergite from Th. II to Abd. IV for dorsal macrochaetae and pseudopores, number of mac in formula correspond to: Th. II anterior + posterior, Th. III lateral + posterior, Abd. IV medial + posteromedial + anterolateral + posterolateral (“≥” or “?” are used in formula for anterior or lateral mac usually not given in old descriptions); from Th. II to Abd. V for S-chaetae; from head to Abd.IV for trichobothria.
</p>
         <p>Chaetotaxy systems.
The dorsal macrochaetotaxic pattern observed in our specimens is almost identical to that of 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus
(
H.
) 
nitidus
(Templeton, 
1835
)
</tp:taxon-name>
described by 
Szeptycki (1972
, 
1979
). We give on 

the chaetal notation proposed by this author for tergites, as well as another notation by groups of chaetae for head (after 

Mari-Mutt 
1979
) and for tergites, that we used rather than individual chaetal notation, in order to avoid uncertainties of chaeta-to-chaeta homologies due to the reduced macrochaetotaxy of the studied species.
</p>
         <p>Vocabulary
. Antenna 
1
and 
2
of authors (

Mari-Mutt 
1980
a

, 
1980
b

) are here named Ia and Ib to preserve homologies with other 
<tp:taxon-name>Entomobryidae</tp:taxon-name>
, as they correspond to the splitting of Ant. I of 
<tp:taxon-name>Collembola</tp:taxon-name>
; Ant. 3, 4 and 
5
are here Ant. II, III and IV.
</p>
         <p>Chaetal nomenclature.
The basic distinction between ordinary chaetae (“chaetae”) and S-chaetae (“sensilla” of authors) follow the rationale of 

Deharveng (
1983
)

. S-like chaetae correspond to the "setulae" of 

Szeptycki (
1979
: 
10
)

when they cannot be assigned unambiguously to S-chaetae. On the tergite, ms designate short pointed Schaetae, and sens larger ones, following the convention used in Potapov (
2001
) for 
<tp:taxon-name>Isotomidae</tp:taxon-name>
and 

Zhang &amp; Deharveng (
2015
)

for 
<tp:taxon-name>Entomobryidae</tp:taxon-name>
. On the antennae, where chaetotaxy is extremely diversified in Entomobryoidea, we described all kinds of chaetae that were able to discriminate morphologically, but did not try to match the notation systems previously published in the literature which are less complete. This important task will require extensive comparative investigations beyond the scope of this paper.

for genetic examination of the divergences (

was extracted from entire specimens in 
30
µl of lysis buffer (http://www.ccdb.ca/docs/

56
ºC overnight. 
DNA
extraction followed a standard automated protocol using 
96

Ivanova 
et al
. 
2006
). Specimens were recovered after 
DNA
extraction using a specially designed work flow allowing their morphological examination (

Porco

2010
). The 
5
’ region of 
COI
used as a standard 
DNA
barcode was amplified using M 
13
tailed primers LCO 
1490
and HCO 
2198
(

Folmer 
et al
. 
1994
). Samples that failed to generate an amplicon were subsequently amplified with a pair of internal primers combined with full length ones (C_LepFolF/C_LepFolR) (Ivanova—published on www.boldsystems.org). The standard PCR reaction protocol of the Canadian Center for 
DNA
Barcoding was used for amplifications (http:// www.dnabarcodes 
2011
.org/conference/preconference/CCDB-Amplification-animals.pdf), and products were checked on a 
2
% E-gel 
96
Agarose (Invitrogen). Unpurified PCR amplicons were sequenced in both directions using M 
13
tailed primers, with products subsequently purified using Agencourt CleanSEQ protocol and processed using BigDye version 
3.1
on an ABI 
3730DNA
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were assembled and edited with Sequencher

The

<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus
(
Verhoeffiella
) 
absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
has not been retrieved in spite of thorough investigations in regional Museums and in 
Czech republic
, including: Natural History Museum of 
Montenegro
, Podgorica, National Museum of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina
, Sarajevo, Croatian Natural History Museum, Zagreb, The Moravian Museum, Brno, Mendel University in Brno - Department of Zoology, Fisheries, Hydrobiology and Apiculture (formally Zoologicky ustav vysoke školy zemedelske v Brne where Kseneman was working, pers. com. Jan Bezdek). It was also not possible to locate Ksenemans collection (Rusek and Weiner, pers. com.). 
Type
material can be therefore considered as lost. We propose here as 
neotype
a specimen from the

1.75 – 2
times as long as Abd. III. Color pale orange, pigment scattered as orange dots ventrally and dorsally on body, manubrium, coxa, paler on trochanter and femur. Intersegment area, mouth parts, antennae, other leg segments, and dens unpigmented. Body dorsally and laterally with white regular patches on an orange background (

). Eyes absent, no pigment patch at their place. Body, mouthparts and appendages with a large diversity of phaneres. Most can be assigned to the traditional four 
types
of chaetae: ordinary chaetae, S-chaetae, trichobothria and scales; several other kinds of specialized chaetae occur on mouth and antennae. Pseudopores of same size as mac socket, observed on antennae, tergites, legs and manubrium.

</p>
            <p>Head and body
(

). Chaetae are rather diverse on head (

) and body (

), with the following categories usually relatively easy to recognize:
</p>
            <p>
– serrated mac, either clubbed (
sensu

and 
28

</p>
            <p>
– serrated mes on head and body (

</p>
            <p>
– thin mes slightly serrated on its distal half and associated with thin S-chaetae (

c);
</p>
            <p>
– smooth mes, only on head (

c);
</p>
            <p>
– trichobothria on head (

d) and tergites, often fallen in our specimens; those of head (
1

1
) located laterally and rather short (
50
µm), those of tergites longer;
</p>
            <p>
– S-chaetae, limited to tergites, smooth, very short, thick, pointed (ms, 

d);
</p>
            <p>
– thin S-chaetae, limited to tergites, smooth, short and hyaline, subcylindrical, blunt (sens, 

e);
</p>
            <p>
– smooth, thin, blunt, short to long S-like chaetae, longer, less transparent and slightly thicker than thin Schaetae, only on Abd. IV (

f 
1
and f 
2
);
</p>
            <p>
– mic, 
2
minute on each anal valve, and 
2
+ 
2
on female genital plate (

g);
</p>
            <p>
Scales on dorsal and ventral side of head and body, rounded to oval-elongated, sometimes truncated, hyaline, overlapping, of various size (from 
15 to 100
µm long), with a dense cover of short spicules arranged in more or less regular lines (

).
</p>
            <p>
Chaetae, scales and trichobothria of dorsal side of head and body usually detached in microscopic preparations or on skins retrieved after 
DNA
extraction. Chaetae have circular or oval sockets, those of mac and large mes easily recognizable by their size, but those of tergite S-chaetae not distinguishable from those of small mes. Scale sockets are characterized by cupuliform morphology of their socket. Trichobothria have small round socket often with minute point in the middle, but often indistinguishable from mes sockets.
</p>
            <p>
Head dorsally with macrochaetae arranged as in 

, and dense cover of small to large scales and short serrated mes; laterally with scales mixed with medium size serrated mes; between antennae with few smooth mes; posteriorly with row of serrated mes regularly interspersed with large scales; ventrally with smooth and serrated mes and small to medium-size scales;

The extensive re-description of 
<tp:taxon-name>H
. (
V
.) 
absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
given here is the first detailed description of a species of the subgenus, all existing ones being very succinct and lacking most characters used in modern taxonomy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Entomobryidae</tp:taxon-name>
. Several morphological features, described for the first time for the subgenus, revealed interesting characters, e.g. the presence of a chaeta ms on Th. III. It was observed in two specimens only, but S-chaetae are often very difficult to detect; if it is not an aberration, it would be unique among Entomobryoidea. The detailed description of antennal chaetotaxy shows a huge diversity in chaetae morphological 
types
. Their distribution on antennae follows recognizable but loose patterns, as chaetae-to-chaetae homologies are not possible, with a few exceptions, between adults of a same species or between whorls of Ant. III–IV. The descriptive framework set up in this paper will be used as a reference in the ongoing subgenus revision.

Kseneman (

. 

Gama (

characterized the Forat del Rastre specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. (V.) absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
, by four features: 
1
) antennae long but shorter than body;

3
) unguiculus long with a small outer tooth; 
4
) mucro curved, with apical tooth larger than the ante-apical one, with a thin basal chaeta. In addition, the author figured the pattern of dorsal macrochaetotaxy and the claw. Based on our own observation and Gama characterization of specimens from Forat del Rastre together with molecular comparison of specimens from the

, who did not considered it as a good taxonomic character. However, the author did not analyzed this variability in populations, and used the presence/absence of ciliated chaetae (but not their number) as one of the character for separating

(

<tp:taxon-name>major</tp:taxon-name>
and group

Diagnosis of 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus</tp:taxon-name>
(
Verhoeffiel la
).

The diagnosis of the subgenus provided below is provisional, as diagnostic characters are unknown in several species.
</p>
            <p>
Medium to large size (
1.6–5.3 mm
). Eyes absent. Body white, yellowish or pale orange, usually with pigment as orange dots. Scales present, rounded, their surface covered with numerous short spicules arranged longitudinally. Mac present dorsally on head and body, in small number, with typical arrangement (not known in several species). Ant. I divided in two subsegments, Ant. II entire, Ant. III and IV annulated. Antennae of various length, slightly shorter to longer than body. Abd. IV 
1.5 to 2
times as long as Abd. III (contradictory statements in the original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>H
. (
V
.) 
dallai</tp:taxon-name>
, where the ratio is given as “nearly two times” and “ 
2.8-3
times” elsewhere in the text. This last ratio would be unusual, rather pointing to a 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudosinella</tp:taxon-name>
species). Unguis thin and elongate, usually with one inner pair of small basal teeth, and one inner small unpaired tooth. Tita with thin, acuminate tenent hair. Dens devoid of spines. Mucro bidentate with basal spine.

Designation of 
neotype
.

The 
type
material of 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus
(
Verhoeffiella
) 
absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
has not been retrieved in spite of thorough investigations in regional Museums and in 
Czech republic
, including: Natural History Museum of 
Montenegro
, Podgorica, National Museum of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina
, Sarajevo, Croatian Natural History Museum, Zagreb, The Moravian Museum, Brno, Mendel University in Brno - Department of Zoology, Fisheries, Hydrobiology and Apiculture (formally Zoologicky ustav vysoke školy zemedelske v Brne where Kseneman was working, pers. com. Jan Bezdek). It was also not possible to locate Ksenemans collection (Rusek and Weiner, pers. com.). 
Type
material can be therefore considered as lost. We propose here as 
neotype
a specimen from the 
type
locality.

Intersegment area, mouth parts, antennae, other leg segments, and dens unpigmented. Body dorsally and laterally with white regular patches on an orange background (

). Eyes absent, no pigment patch at their place. Body, mouthparts and appendages with a large diversity of phaneres. Most can be assigned to the traditional four 
types
of chaetae: ordinary chaetae, S-chaetae, trichobothria and scales; several other kinds of specialized chaetae occur on mouth and antennae. Pseudopores of same size as mac socket, observed on antennae, tergites, legs and manubrium.

). Chaetae are rather diverse on head (

) and body (

), with the following categories usually relatively easy to recognize:
</p>
            <p>
– serrated mac, either clubbed (

</p>
            <p>
– serrated mes on head and body (

</p>
            <p>
– thin mes slightly serrated on its distal half and associated with thin S-chaetae (

c);
</p>
            <p>
– smooth mes, only on head (

c);
</p>
            <p>
– trichobothria on head (

d) and tergites, often fallen in our specimens; those of head (
1
+ 
1
) located laterally and rather short (
50
µm), those of tergites longer;
</p>
            <p>
– S-chaetae, limited to tergites, smooth, very short, thick, pointed (ms, 

d);
</p>
            <p>
– thin S-chaetae, limited to tergites, smooth, short and hyaline, subcylindrical, blunt (sens, 

e);
</p>
            <p>
– smooth, thin, blunt, short to long S-like chaetae, longer, less transparent and slightly thicker than thin Schaetae, only on Abd. IV (

</p>
            <p>
– mic, 
2
minute on each anal valve, and 
2

</p>
            <p>
Scales on dorsal and ventral side of head and body, rounded to oval-elongated, sometimes truncated, hyaline, overlapping, of various size (from 
15 to 100
µm long), with a dense cover of short spicules arranged in more or less regular lines (

).
</p>
            <p>
Chaetae, scales and trichobothria of dorsal side of head and body usually detached in microscopic preparations or on skins retrieved after 
DNA
extraction. Chaetae have circular or oval sockets, those of mac and large mes easily recognizable by their size, but those of tergite S-chaetae not distinguishable from those of small mes. Scale sockets are characterized by cupuliform morphology of their socket. Trichobothria have small round socket often with minute point in the middle, but often indistinguishable from mes sockets.

The extensive re-description of

. (

absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
given here is the first detailed description of a species of the subgenus, all existing ones being very succinct and lacking most characters used in modern taxonomy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Entomobryidae</tp:taxon-name>
. Several morphological features, described for the first time for the subgenus, revealed interesting characters, e.g. the presence of a chaeta ms on Th. III. It was observed in two specimens only, but S-chaetae are often very difficult to detect; if it is not an aberration, it would be unique among Entomobryoidea. The detailed description of antennal chaetotaxy shows a huge diversity in chaetae morphological 
types
. Their distribution on antennae follows recognizable but loose patterns, as chaetae-to-chaetae homologies are not possible, with a few exceptions, between adults of a same species or between whorls of Ant. III–IV. The descriptive framework set up in this paper will be used as a reference in the ongoing subgenus revision.

are not specified by the author. However, given that Gama did not examine the 
type
material of the species, she must have relied on antenna length and inner tooth position on claw, which are the only features mentioned, but not illustrated, in the original and sole description of the species by 

Kseneman (
1938
)

. 

Gama (
1984
)

characterized the Forat del Rastre specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. (V.) absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
, by four features: 
1
) antennae long but shorter than body; 
2
) claw elongated, with a pair of inner proximal teeth and an uneven unpaired inner tooth at 
50
% of its inner edge; 
3
) unguiculus long with a small outer tooth; 
4
) mucro curved, with apical tooth larger than the ante-apical one, with a thin basal chaeta. In addition, the author figured the pattern of dorsal macrochaetotaxy and the claw. Based on our own observation and Gama characterization of specimens from Forat del Rastre together with molecular comparison of specimens from the 
type
locality in 
Montenegro
and from the Catalan population we established that the population from Forat del Rastre is a new species described here as

, who did not considered it as a good taxonomic character. However, the author did not analyzed this variability in populations, and used the presence/absence of ciliated chaetae (but not their number) as one of the character for separating

(
H.

<tp:taxon-name>major</tp:taxon-name>

Diagnosis of 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus</tp:taxon-name>
(
Verhoeffiel la
).

The diagnosis of the subgenus provided below is provisional, as diagnostic characters are unknown in several species.
</p>
            <p>
Medium to large size (
1.6–5.3 mm
). Eyes absent. Body white, yellowish or pale orange, usually with pigment as orange dots. Scales present, rounded, their surface covered with numerous short spicules arranged longitudinally. Mac present dorsally on head and body, in small number, with typical arrangement (not known in several species). Ant. I divided in two subsegments, Ant. II entire, Ant. III and IV annulated. Antennae of various length, slightly shorter to longer than body. Abd. IV 
1.5 to 2
times as long as Abd. III (contradictory statements in the original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>H

dallai</tp:taxon-name>
, where the ratio is given as “nearly two times” and “ 
2.8-3
times” elsewhere in the text. This last ratio would be unusual, rather pointing to a 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudosinella</tp:taxon-name>
species). Unguis thin and elongate, usually with one inner pair of small basal teeth, and one inner small unpaired tooth. Tita with thin, acuminate tenent hair. Dens devoid of spines. Mucro bidentate with basal spine.

            <p>Remark.
The subgenus

only differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus</tp:taxon-name>
by the annulation of Ant. III.

Designation of

.

The 
type
material of 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus
(
Verhoeffiella
) 
absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
has not been retrieved in spite of thorough investigations in regional Museums and in 
Czech republic
, including: Natural History Museum of 
Montenegro
, Podgorica, National Museum of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina
, Sarajevo, Croatian Natural History Museum, Zagreb, The Moravian Museum, Brno, Mendel University in Brno - Department of Zoology, Fisheries, Hydrobiology and Apiculture (formally Zoologicky ustav vysoke školy zemedelske v Brne where Kseneman was working, pers. com. Jan Bezdek). It was also not possible to locate Ksenemans collection (Rusek and Weiner, pers. com.). 
Type
material can be therefore considered as lost. We propose here as 
neotype
a specimen from the 
type
locality.

            <p>Redescription.
Head and body length combined without antennae: 
2.7 to 3.2 mm
(N=

). Habitus as in 

. Abd. IV 
1.75 – 2
times as long as Abd. III. Color pale orange, pigment scattered as orange dots ventrally and dorsally on body, manubrium, coxa, paler on trochanter and femur. Intersegment area, mouth parts, antennae, other leg segments, and dens unpigmented. Body dorsally and laterally with white regular patches on an orange background (

). Eyes absent, no pigment patch at their place. Body, mouthparts and appendages with a large diversity of phaneres. Most can be assigned to the traditional four 
types
of chaetae: ordinary chaetae, S-chaetae, trichobothria and scales; several other kinds of specialized chaetae occur on mouth and antennae. Pseudopores of same size as mac socket, observed on antennae, tergites, legs and manubrium.

5
), located in the intersegment just above sensorial areas.

</p>
            <p>Head and body
(

). Chaetae are rather diverse on head (

) and body (

), with the following categories usually relatively easy to recognize:
</p>
            <p>
– serrated mac, either clubbed (
sensu

and 
28

</p>
            <p>
– serrated mes on head and body (

</p>
            <p>
– thin mes slightly serrated on its distal half and associated with thin S-chaetae (

c);
</p>
            <p>
– smooth mes, only on head (

c);
</p>
            <p>
– trichobothria on head (

d) and tergites, often fallen in our specimens; those of head (
1

1
) located laterally and rather short (
50
µm), those of tergites longer;
</p>
            <p>
– S-chaetae, limited to tergites, smooth, very short, thick, pointed (ms, 

d);
</p>
            <p>
– thin S-chaetae, limited to tergites, smooth, short and hyaline, subcylindrical, blunt (sens, 

e);
</p>
            <p>
– smooth, thin, blunt, short to long S-like chaetae, longer, less transparent and slightly thicker than thin Schaetae, only on Abd. IV (

f 
1
and f

);
</p>
            <p>
– mic, 
2
minute on each anal valve, and 
2
+ 
2
on female genital plate (

</p>
            <p>
Scales on dorsal and ventral side of head and body, rounded to oval-elongated, sometimes truncated, hyaline, overlapping, of various size (from 
15 to 100
µm long), with a dense cover of short spicules arranged in more or less regular lines (

).
</p>
            <p>
Chaetae, scales and trichobothria of dorsal side of head and body usually detached in microscopic preparations or on skins retrieved after 
DNA
extraction. Chaetae have circular or oval sockets, those of mac and large mes easily recognizable by their size, but those of tergite S-chaetae not distinguishable from those of small mes. Scale sockets are characterized by cupuliform morphology of their socket. Trichobothria have small round socket often with minute point in the middle, but often indistinguishable from mes sockets.
</p>
            <p>
Head dorsally with macrochaetae arranged as in 

, and dense cover of small to large scales and short serrated mes; laterally with scales mixed with medium size serrated mes; between antennae with few smooth mes; posteriorly with row of serrated mes regularly interspersed with large scales; ventrally with smooth and serrated mes and small to medium-size scales;

The extensive re-description of 
<tp:taxon-name>H
. (
V
.) 
absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
given here is the first detailed description of a species of the subgenus, all existing ones being very succinct and lacking most characters used in modern taxonomy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Entomobryidae</tp:taxon-name>
. Several morphological features, described for the first time for the subgenus, revealed interesting characters, e.g. the presence of a chaeta ms on Th. III. It was observed in two specimens only, but S-chaetae are often very difficult to detect; if it is not an aberration, it would be unique among Entomobryoidea. The detailed description of antennal chaetotaxy shows a huge diversity in chaetae morphological 
types
. Their distribution on antennae follows recognizable but loose patterns, as chaetae-to-chaetae homologies are not possible, with a few exceptions, between adults of a same species or between whorls of Ant. III–IV. The descriptive framework set up in this paper will be used as a reference in the ongoing subgenus revision.

material of the species, she must have relied on antenna length and inner tooth position on claw, which are the only features mentioned, but not illustrated, in the original and sole description of the species by 

Kseneman (

. 

Gama (

characterized the Forat del Rastre specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. (V.) absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
, by four features: 
1
) antennae long but shorter than body; 
2
) claw elongated, with a pair of inner proximal teeth and an uneven unpaired inner tooth at 
50
% of its inner edge; 
3
) unguiculus long with a small outer tooth; 
4
) mucro curved, with apical tooth larger than the ante-apical one, with a thin basal chaeta. In addition, the author figured the pattern of dorsal macrochaetotaxy and the claw. Based on our own observation and Gama characterization of specimens from Forat del Rastre together with molecular comparison of specimens from the 
type

Montenegro
and from the Catalan population we established that the population from Forat del Rastre is a new species described here as

Gama (

, the standard pattern of Heteromurinae. The evolutionary stasis of the dorsal macrochaetotaxy pattern, suggested by its remarkable similarity between several species very different otherwise, is therefore not retrieved in

            <p>Labial triangle
(

). Number of chaetae of the labial triangle is variable in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus</tp:taxon-name>
according to 

Mari-Mutt (
1980
b)

, who did not considered it as a good taxonomic character. However, the author did not analyzed this variability in populations, and used the presence/absence of ciliated chaetae (but not their number) as one of the character for separating 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus</tp:taxon-name>
(
H.
) in two groups (group 
<tp:taxon-name>major</tp:taxon-name>
and group 
<tp:taxon-name>nitidus</tp:taxon-name>
). Actually, from our observations, the variation in number of chaetae is relatively limited within populations. The number of chaetae in the labial triangle, expressed as ranges, may be therefore a valuable taxonomic character within Heteromurinae. In both

               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
is very slender and elongated, with external edge basally sinuous, bearing smaller pair of basal teeth and of inner unpaired tooth. Unguiculus is slender and pointed with small outer tooth at 
30
% from its base. Unguis and unguiculus of 
<tp:taxon-name>H.
(

absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
are less elongated that those of the Catalan population, being intermediate with those of 
<tp:taxon-name>H.

Diagnosis of 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus</tp:taxon-name>
(
Verhoeffiel la
).

The diagnosis of the subgenus provided below is provisional, as diagnostic characters are unknown in several species.
</p>
            <p>
Medium to large size (
1.6–5.3 mm
). Eyes absent. Body white, yellowish or pale orange, usually with pigment as orange dots. Scales present, rounded, their surface covered with numerous short spicules arranged longitudinally. Mac present dorsally on head and body, in small number, with typical arrangement (not known in several species). Ant. I divided in two subsegments, Ant. II entire, Ant. III and IV annulated. Antennae of various length, slightly shorter to longer than body. Abd. IV 
1.5 to 2
times as long as Abd. III (contradictory statements in the original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>H
. (
V
.) 
dallai</tp:taxon-name>
, where the ratio is given as “nearly two times” and “ 
2.8-3
times” elsewhere in the text. This last ratio would be unusual, rather pointing to a 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudosinella</tp:taxon-name>
species). Unguis thin and elongate, usually with one inner pair of small basal teeth, and one inner small unpaired tooth. Tita with thin, acuminate tenent hair. Dens devoid of spines. Mucro bidentate with basal spine.

            <p>Remark.
The subgenus

by the annulation of Ant. III.

Designation of 
neotype
.

The 
type
material of 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus
(
Verhoeffiella
) 
absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
has not been retrieved in spite of thorough investigations in regional Museums and in 
Czech republic
, including: Natural History Museum of 
Montenegro
, Podgorica, National Museum of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina
, Sarajevo, Croatian Natural History Museum, Zagreb, The Moravian Museum, Brno, Mendel University in Brno - Department of Zoology, Fisheries, Hydrobiology and Apiculture (formally Zoologicky ustav vysoke školy zemedelske v Brne where Kseneman was working, pers. com. Jan Bezdek). It was also not possible to locate Ksenemans collection (Rusek and Weiner, pers. com.). 
Type
material can be therefore considered as lost. We propose here as 
neotype
a specimen from the 
type
locality.

            <p>Redescription.
Head and body length combined without antennae: 
2.7 to 3.2 mm
(N= 
8
). Habitus as in 

. Abd. IV 
1.75 – 2
times as long as Abd. III. Color pale orange, pigment scattered as orange dots ventrally and dorsally on body, manubrium, coxa, paler on trochanter and femur. Intersegment area, mouth parts, antennae, other leg segments, and dens unpigmented. Body dorsally and laterally with white regular patches on an orange background (

). Eyes absent, no pigment patch at their place. Body, mouthparts and appendages with a large diversity of phaneres. Most can be assigned to the traditional four 
types
of chaetae: ordinary chaetae, S-chaetae, trichobothria and scales; several other kinds of specialized chaetae occur on mouth and antennae. Pseudopores of same size as mac socket, observed on antennae, tergites, legs and manubrium.
</p>
            <p>Antennae
(

). Antennae 
0.54 to 0.68
as long as (head + body) length (N= 
8
). Antennae 
3
times longer than head diagonal. Ant. segment ratio as Ia:Ib:II:III:IV = 
0.15
: 
0.61
: 
1
: 
1.5
:2.0 (mean values, N= 
9
). Ant. III and IV annulated, except the proximal part of Ant. III and the distal part of Ant. IV. Antennae often asymmetrical, because of the fusion of Ant. III and IV. Pseudopores present ventro-apically on Ant. Ib (
2–5
), Ant. II (
8–14
) and Ant. III (
5
), located in the intersegment just above sensorial areas.
</p>
            <p>

            <p>Head and body
(

). Chaetae are rather diverse on head (

) and body (

), with the following categories usually relatively easy to recognize:
</p>
            <p>
– serrated mac, either clubbed (
sensu

</p>
            <p>

</p>
            <p>
– S-chaetae, limited to tergites, smooth, very short, thick, pointed (ms, 

d);
</p>
            <p>

</p>
            <p>
– mic,

</p>
            <p>
Scales on dorsal and ventral side of head and body, rounded to oval-elongated, sometimes truncated, hyaline, overlapping, of various size (from 
15 to 100
µm long), with a dense cover of short spicules arranged in more or less regular lines (

).
</p>
            <p>
Chaetae, scales and trichobothria of dorsal side of head and body usually detached in microscopic preparations or on skins retrieved after 
DNA
extraction. Chaetae have circular or oval sockets, those of mac and large mes easily recognizable by their size, but those of tergite S-chaetae not distinguishable from those of small mes. Scale sockets are characterized by cupuliform morphology of their socket. Trichobothria have small round socket often with minute point in the middle, but often indistinguishable from mes sockets.

The extensive re-description of 
<tp:taxon-name>H
. (
V
.) 
absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
given here is the first detailed description of a species of the subgenus, all existing ones being very succinct and lacking most characters used in modern taxonomy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Entomobryidae</tp:taxon-name>
. Several morphological features, described for the first time for the subgenus, revealed interesting characters, e.g. the presence of a chaeta ms on Th. III. It was observed in two specimens only, but S-chaetae are often very difficult to detect; if it is not an aberration, it would be unique among Entomobryoidea. The detailed description of antennal chaetotaxy shows a huge diversity in chaetae morphological 
types
. Their distribution on antennae follows recognizable but loose patterns, as chaetae-to-chaetae homologies are not possible, with a few exceptions, between adults of a same species or between whorls of Ant. III–IV. The descriptive framework set up in this paper will be used as a reference in the ongoing subgenus revision.

type
material of the species, she must have relied on antenna length and inner tooth position on claw, which are the only features mentioned, but not illustrated, in the original and sole description of the species by 

Kseneman (
1938

. 

Gama (

characterized the Forat del Rastre specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. (V.) absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
, by four features: 
1
) antennae long but shorter than body; 
2
) claw elongated, with a pair of inner proximal teeth and an uneven unpaired inner tooth at 
50
% of its inner edge; 
3
) unguiculus long with a small outer tooth; 
4
) mucro curved, with apical tooth larger than the ante-apical one, with a thin basal chaeta. In addition, the author figured the pattern of dorsal macrochaetotaxy and the claw. Based on our own observation and Gama characterization of specimens from Forat del Rastre together with molecular comparison of specimens from the 
type
locality in 
Montenegro
and from the Catalan population we established that the population from Forat del Rastre is a new species described here as

         <title>Taxonomical and biogeographical implications</title>
         <p>
Morphological and genetic evidence compiled in this paper unambiguously establish that 
<tp:taxon-name>Heteromurus
(
Verhoeffiella
)
</tp:taxon-name>
of Forat del Rastre is different from 
<tp:taxon-name>H.
(
V.
) 
absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Montenegro
and that it represents a new species, 
<tp:taxon-name>H
. (
V
.) 
gamae</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, well characterized morphologically and genetically. It differs from Dinaric 
<tp:taxon-name>H
. (
V
.) 
absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
in several important characters: dorsal macrochaetotaxy on head and body, distribution of scales on head, labial triangle, tibiotarsus, femur and manubrium chaetotaxy, and claw morphology. To evaluate whether these characters, beyond their value in discriminating the species of interest, represent differences at supra-specific level between Iberic and Dinaric 
<tp:taxon-name>Verhoeffiella</tp:taxon-name>
, further morphological study of other species from both areas are needed. 
As
a result of this paper, the remarkable disjunct distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>H.
(
V.
) 
absoloni</tp:taxon-name>
is no more a biogeographical problem and is proven here to originate from the poor original description of the Dinaric species. But the disjunct distribution of the subgenus 
<tp:taxon-name>Verhoeffiella</tp:taxon-name>
, that comprises species in several largely remote karst areas, remains to be explained. On-going phylogenetic analyses based on molecular data are expected to solve this puzzling biogeographical riddle.
