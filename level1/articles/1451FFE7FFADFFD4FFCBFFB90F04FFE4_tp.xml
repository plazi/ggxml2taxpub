This work tested whether or not populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>Bombus brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
isolated on mountain tops of southeastern 
Brazil
belonged to the same species as populations widespread in lowland areas in the Atlantic coast and westward along the Paraná-river valley. Phylogeographic and population genetic analyses showed that those populations were all conspecific. However, they revealed a previously unrecognized, apparently rare, and potentially endangered species in one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots of the World, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. This species is described here as 
<tp:taxon-name>Bombus bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. n.</named-content>
, and included in a revised key for the identification of the bumblebee species known to occur in 
Brazil
. Phylogenetic analyses based on two 
mt
DNA markers suggest this new species to be sister to 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
, from which its workers and queens can be easily distinguished by the lack of a yellow hair-band on the first metasomal tergum. The results presented here are consistent with the hypothesis that 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. n.</named-content>
may have originated from an ancestral population isolated in an evergreen-forest refuge (the so-called 
Bahia
refuge) during cold, dry periods of the Pleistocene. This refuge is also known as an important area of endemism for several animal taxa, including other bees. Secondary contact between 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
may be presently prevented by a strip of semi-deciduous forest in a climate zone characterized by relatively long dry seasons. Considering the relatively limited range of this new species and the current anthropic pressure on its environment, attention should be given to its conservation status.

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>
Despite the fact that, taxonomically, bees are among the best known insects in the world (for example [
1
]), there are taxonomic problems to be solved in the group, including sex association in dimorphic species and distinction of cryptic species, even in relatively well-known taxa. In these cases, molecular data, including the so called DNA barcode, alone or integrated to other 
types
of characters, have proven to be much useful (for example [
2
, 
3
]).
</p>
         <p>
The bumblebees (genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Bombus
Latreille, 1802
</tp:taxon-name>
) comprise approximately 250 species widely distributed in the world, but occurring mainly in the cool subtropical and temperate areas of the Nearctic and, especially, Palearctic regions [
4
]. Defining species limits in 
<tp:taxon-name>Bombus</tp:taxon-name>
is frequently difficult, because of the lack of useful structural characters and the great variability in hair-color patterns. This has led to an array of recent studies employing DNA markers to elucidate bumblebee-species boundaries (for example [
5
– 
12
]). Molecular tools have also been used in the genus to investigate intraspecific genetic structure, phylogeography and phylogenetic relationships (for example [
13
– 
22
]).
</p>
         <p>
In South America, most of the species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Bombus</tp:taxon-name>
are distributed along the Andes and in temperate regions, with only a few species recorded in the warm lowlands—the later, actually, the only bumblebees to occur in such environments in the world [
1
]. Only six species of the genus are generally referred to occur in 
Brazil
[
23
], all belonging to the same subgenus— 
<tp:taxon-name>Fervidobombus
Skorikov, 1922
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>Thoracobombus
Dalla Torre, 1880
</tp:taxon-name>
, depending on which classification one adopts (for example [
1
, 
24
] or [
25
]). Five of these species (
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bellicosus
Smith, 1879
</tp:taxon-name>
; 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis

</tp:taxon-name>
; 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brevivillus
Franklin, 1913
</tp:taxon-name>
; 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
pauloensis
Friese, 1913
</tp:taxon-name>
; and 
B
. 
<tp:taxon-name>transversalis
(Olivier, 1789))
</tp:taxon-name>
seem to be very closely related, while the sixth one, 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
morio
(Swederus, 1787)
</tp:taxon-name>
belongs to a distinctive clade in the same subgenus [
19
, 
21
]. 
<tp:taxon-name>Bombus pauloensis</tp:taxon-name>
has been widely treated as 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
atratus
Franklin, 
1913</tp:taxon-name>
in the literature (for an explanation for the adoption of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
pauloensis</tp:taxon-name>
as a valid name, see [
24
]). The occurrence of a seventh species in western 
Brazil
, 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
pullatus
Franklin, 1913
</tp:taxon-name>
, was reported by Milliron [
26
], but considered with suspicion by Abrahamovich &amp; Díaz [
27
], and ignored by Moure &amp; Melo [
24
], and needs confirmation. An eighth species, 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
rubriventris
Lepeletier, 1836
</tp:taxon-name>
, was recorded with doubts by Milliron [
26
] as possibly occurring in the state of 
Goiás
. According to him, this species, known only from its female 
holotype
, would be very rare or extinct. One cannot rule out the possibility that the assignment of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
rubriventris</tp:taxon-name>
to 
Brazil
resulted from mere labeling mistake or from wrong interpretation of the type locality (see [
26
] for details).
</p>
         <p>
In their thorough revision of the Brazilian bumblebees, Moure &amp; Sakagami [
23
]) noted that 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis
Lepeletier, 1836
</tp:taxon-name>
was the only species to be more common on mountaintops (mainly in the ranges along the southern and eastern Brazilian coasts) than in lowlands, and that it was the only one recorded in elevations above 
1,800 m
. Later, Silveira &amp; Cure [
28
] noted that 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
is absent in the lowlands surrounding the mountain ranges where it is relatively common further inland in southeastern 
Brazil
. The occurrence of these isolated mountaintop populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
raised the suspicion that they might in fact belong to a species different from the one present in the lowlands along the coast and in the 
Paraná
River valley. Here, this hypothesis is tested, mainly by means of phylogenetic and population-genetic analyses of two 
mt
DNA genes. Since the question of how to delimit species boundaries is still in debate (see, for instance, the revision by Wiley &amp; Lieberman [
29
]), different character sources (molecular and morphological) and analytical methods (tree and non-tree based) were complementarily employed to decide whether or not a set of populations should be considered as a new taxon.

The description of the new species presented below was based on six specimens—three workers and a queen from the municipality of Ilhéus, in the Brazilian state of 
Bahia
, and two workers collected in the municipality of Conceição da Barra, state of 
Espírito Santo
. These specimens are deposited at the Taxonomic Collections of the ‘Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais’— UFMG—and in the ‘Padre Jesus 
Santiago
Moure’ entomological collection, of the ‘Universidade Federal do Paraná’—DZUP—, as detailed in the section “Taxonomic treatment”, below. Two collecting expeditions were conducted in southern 
Bahia
and northern 
Espírito Santo
states (coordinates of sampling sites are, in

), under the collecting permit number 23784 (granted by “Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade” to JESJ), in an attempt to increase molecular sample size and geographic representation. No additional specimens were found, however, during these expeditions.
</p>
         <p>
The specimens were examined under a dissection microscope (Leica M125) and compared to the descriptions in Moure &amp; Sakagami [
23
]. Comparisons were also made with photographs of the 
lectotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis
Lepeletier, 1836
</tp:taxon-name>
, reproduced here in 

. Direct observation of this type was not done because, after examining hundreds of specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
from all its geographic range, an easily-observable diagnostic character was found to distinguish the two concerned species, which could be readily checked in the photographs obtained from the type. Morphological terminology employed here is mostly that of Moure &amp; Sakagami [
23
]. Flagellomeres are designated as F1, F2, F3 etc. Accordingly, metasomal terga and sterna are designated as T1, T2, T3 etc and S1, S2, S3 etc. The apical width of the malar area is the shortest width of the malar area, measured along the mandible base.
</p>
         <p>
Two mitochondrial markers, Cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and Cytochrome B (CytB) were employed in addition to the morphological characters. DNA was extracted from one of the hind legs of each of 168 
<tp:taxon-name>Bombus</tp:taxon-name>
specimens, 142 of them belonging to 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
, three to the species described as new below, and the rest belonging to the other species of the genus known to occur in 
Brazil
(S1 Table). This was done through the phenol–chloroform method [
30
]. The extracted DNA was re-suspended in 40μL of TE buffer. The 5’region of the COI gene was amplified using the primers LepF1 and LepR1 [
31
], mtd_6 and mtd_9 [
32
], and that of the CytB was amplified using the primers mtd_26 [
32
] and CytB_R1, 5'TTCAATTATTTGACTT CCTAATCAAG3' (designed for this analysis). Amplification of both genes was done in a 30μL polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mix, including 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 2 mM MgCl 
2
, in 
1x
PCR buffer, 0.5 μM of each primer, 2.5 mMdNTPs and about 
20 ng
of genomic DNA. Amplification was carried out in a thermocycler using a program consisting of 5 min of denaturation at 94°C, followed by 35 30-second cycles at 94°C, 40 s at 48–51°C, 1 min at 72°C, and a final extension for 10 min at 72°C. PCR products were visualized in a 0.8% agarose gel. All PCRs that generated a single product were purified using polyethylene glycol 20% (PEG) precipitation (modified of Sambrook &amp; Russel [
30
]—S2 Table). This purified PCR product was sequenced in both directions using a MegaBACE 1000 sequencer (GE Healthcare) with the same amplification primers following the manufacturer's recommendations. The raw sequences were obtained using the software Phred v. 0.20425 [
33
]. The final sequences were assembled with the software Phrap v. 0.990319 (http//www.phrap.org). Consed 19.0 [
34
] was used to view and edit the high quality consensus sequences. Alignments of the consensus sequences for all individuals were generated using MUSCLE [
35
] implemented in the program MEGA 5.01 [
36
].

Molecular extraction and sequencing were done in the Biodiversity and Molecular Evolution Lab (LBEM), atthe Universidade 
FederaldeMinas Gerais
, Belo Horizonte, 
Brazil
. Inaddition to the 306 sequences generated here (168 COI, and 138 CytB sequences) for five species, 49 COI sequences available in the GenBank were employed for 16 species belonging to the subgenus 
<tp:taxon-name>Thoracobombus</tp:taxon-name>
(sensu Williams et al. [

]) (
Table 1
). Additionally, sequences from three others specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bellicosus</tp:taxon-name>
, stored in the Barcode of Life Database, and kindly made available by Dr. P. Tubaro, from the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales, were also employed (

The computer programs Arlequin version 3.5.1.2 [

[

FS
test of selective neutrality. DnaSP was also used to verify non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions. Haplotype networks constructed using the median-joining algorithm (MJ) [

</p>
         <p>
Average intra and interspecific genetic distances were obtained with Mega 5.01, using the parameters of the Kimura 2 model—K2P [
40
]. Two analyses were performed with different data sets, one using only the COI gene and the other employing a concatenated data set of the COI and CytB genes. This was done because: 1) There were more COI than CytB sequences available in GenBank and BOLD for species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Thoracobombus</tp:taxon-name>
(sensu Williams et al.[
25
]); and 2) There were no CytB sequences available for many of the specimens from which DNA was extracted for this work.
</p>
         <p>Since primers used here were not the same as those employed for obtaining the sequences in GenBank and BOLD, only 402 bp were present in all sequences used in the COI-only analyses. Intraspecific distances were estimated only for species represented by three or more specimens, with at least two different haplotypes.</p>
         <p>
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using a concatenated matrix with CytB and COIgene data, including a total of 
138 specimens
, with 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
morio</tp:taxon-name>
as the outgroup. The best fit substitution model estimated with Modeltest 3.7 [
41
] for this analysis was the GTR+G model.
</p>
         <p>
Phylogenies were generated through Bayesian Inference (BI) in MrBayes 3.1 [
42
], and through Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithms using the program PAUP 
*
4.0b10 [
43
]. Inferencesof trees with MP and ML methods were performed using heuristic search, with the following parameters: stepwise addition (random) starting from a single initial tree and branch swapping (tree bisection and reconnection—TBR). MP analysis was set to retain up to 1000 most parsimonious trees. The bootstrap method was used as a measure of branch support for the recovered phylogenies, using a total of 10,000 and 100 replications, respectively, for MP and ML. Phylogenetic analyses using BI used two sets of Markov chains, each containing three hot chains and one cold, with 20 million generations with a 25% burn-in, to seek for convergence to the same subset of best trees.

         <p>Concatenated population analyses</p>
         <p>
The phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes and their geographical correlation, using the concatenated CytB (683 bp) and COI (471 bp) sequences (totaling 1154 bp), showed that populations from almost all the geographic range of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
share haplotypes, as shown by the haplotype network, which suggests lack of population structure (

). In contradiction to the initial hypothesis, thus, this result suggests that populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
isolated in mountain tops away from the coast belong in the same species as those living in coastal forests from the state of Rio de Janeiro southward to the state of Santa Catarina and westward to 
Paraguay
in the Paraná-river valley.
</p>
         <p>
On the other hand, these results indicate that the three specimens collected in the coastal forest of southern 
Bahia state
(municipality of Ilhéus, all with the same haplotype) diverged from 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
by 38 mutation steps (

), suggesting that this population belongs to a different species (described below as 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. n.</named-content>
)
</p>
         <p>
The population analysis of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
included a total of 
124 specimens
, from 30 localities (

). It resulted in 27 haplotypes, 17 polymorphic sites (11 synonymous and six nonsynonymous mutations), 10 of which were parsimoniously informative and seven were autapomorphies (singleton sites). The total haplotype diversity (Hd), nucleotide diversity (π), and average number of nucleotide differences (K) were 
0.886
, 
0.003
and 3.057, respectively. The statistics for the neutrality tests were D = -0.083 (p = 0.5) for Tajima’ s, and FS = -12.28 (p = 0.001) for Fu’ s. Although the Tajima’ s Dwas not statistically significant, the significant value of Fu’ s FS, associated with the large number of unique haplotypes and the star-shaped haplotype network, suggests recent population expansion.

The intraspecific distances among the 
<tp:taxon-name>Thoracobombus</tp:taxon-name>
species analyzed here, estimated with the COI sequences, were all equal or smaller than 0.5% (
Table 2
). One exception was the mean intraspecific distance for 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brevivillus</tp:taxon-name>
, which was very high when all specimens originally attributed to this species where considered together (
Table 2
). Moreover, the average distance between the two “ 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brevivillus</tp:taxon-name>”
clades obtained in the phylogenetic results described below is 3.92 ± 0.93%. This suggests that the samples considered here as belonging to 
<tp:taxon-name>B

include specimens of two distinct species (

         <p>
Of the 1157 bp employed in the phylogenetic analyses (686 bp for CytB and 471 for COI), 916 were constant, three were gaps; eight variable characters were parsimony-uninformative, and 233 were parsimony-informative. Those three gaps are due to one CytB codon appearing exclusively in 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
morio</tp:taxon-name>
(included as the outgroup) and were the cause for the difference in pair-base numbers between the data employed in the phylogenetic and the population analyses.
</p>
         <p>
The phylogenetic analyses yielded the same single topology for Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analysis (

). This tree was yielded after 1,102,282 rearrangements in the MP analyses and was 302-steps long. The average standard deviation of split frequencies after 20 million generations in the Bayesian analysis was of 0.002869, indicating convergence to a single subset of trees.
</p>
         <p>
The phylogenetic analyses are congruent with the population analyses in suggesting that populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
isolated on the top of mountain ranges in southeastern 
Brazil
belong to the same species as those in the Atlantic coast and in the lowlands of the Paraná-river valley (S1 Fig). They also show that specimens originally attributed to

revealed a character also allowing for their distinction: The pilosity of T1, which is entirely yellow in 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
and mostly black in 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
(see key below). Furthermore, this character led to the recognition that two additional specimens from Conceição da Barra (northern 
Espírito Santo state
) also belong in 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
Bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
sp.n. (these latter specimens were too old and DNA extraction from them was not attempted). Considering the molecular and morphological evidence, the specimens from southern 
Bahia
attributed to 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
in our samples are considered here to be a species distinct from that containing the remaining populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
Two pieces of evidence indicate that the name 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
should be applied to the species occurring along the coast of 
Rio de Janeiro
and southwards: 
a)
the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
has its first metasomal tergum covered with yellow pilosity (

), as opposed to black, as in specimens from southern 
Bahia
(

); and 
b)
the fact that this type specimen was probably collected in the vicinities of the city of 
Rio de Janeiro
[
23
].
</p>
         <p>
Moreover, two synonyms are recognized for 
<tp:taxon-name>B

[
23
, 
24
], the former described from Teresópolis (on the top of the Serra do Mar mountain range, in the state of Rio de Janeiro— 

) and the latter from 
Paraguay
. The fact that populations sampled in 
Paraguay
and on the mountaintops in southeastern 
Brazil
showed to be conspecific with specimens from the southern Atlantic coast in the phylogenetic and population-genetic analyses, indicate that those names should continue to be considered as synonyms of 
<tp:taxon-name>B

. Taking all above in account, the populations occurring to the north of the Doce river, in the coastal forests of northern 
Espírito Santo
and southern

submarginal cells (measured on their posterior margins)– 1.7, 1.3.
</p>
            <p>Structure
: labrum biconvex; disc of clypeus depressed; malar area slightly shorter than wide; interocellar distance larger than ocellorbital.
</p>
            <p>Body color
: black, except reddish-brown on posterior tibia; wings dark brown, with light cupreous hue.
</p>
            <p>Body surface
: clypeus coarsely punctate, except on disc, irregularly punctate with shiny interspaces; area between lateral ocelli and eye impunctate, smooth and shiny, except for a micro-punctate region on upper paraocular area, near upper inner-margin of compound eyes, which is narrower than mid-ocellar diameter, generally occupying one third of ocellorbital distance; glabrous area on disc of mesoscutum ill-defined, mostly restricted to region posterior to median mesoscutal line, lightly micro-reticulate but shiny; glabrous shiny area on inner surface of hind femur relatively narrow (less than half the width of the surface) occupying the apical three-fourths of the femoral length.
</p>
            <p>Pubescence
: on head, black bristles intermixed with greyish plumose hairs, most abundant between antennal sockets; on mesosoma, long, fine hairs with long branches, light yellow, except for black intertegular band; on inner surface of hind tibia, fine, spatulate, the flat apical portion triangular, restricted to the very tip of each seta; on T1- T5 long and fine, with long branches, on T3 light yellow, on other terga, black; on T6 black and short; on sterna and legs, black and short.
</p>
            <p>Variation
: the integument varies from black to reddish brown, especially on legs and metasoma; black hairs with light-yellow tips may occur on T1.
</p>
            <p>Queen.
Similar to worker, except for the vertex much elevated above level of ocelli, as normally occurs in

            <p>Etymology.
The name 
<tp:taxon-name>bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
refers both to the Brazilian state of 
Bahia
, where the 
holotype
and some of the 
paratypes
were collected, and to its habitat, the 
Bahia
Forest (see explanation below, under “distribution”).
</p>
         </tp:treatment-sec>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>Distribution.
The species seems to be restricted to the so-called 
Bahia
Forest, which is the especially luxuriant Atlantic Forest formation that covers southern 
Bahia
and northern 
Espírito Santo
states, in 
Brazil
(

was relatively small, and this may raise the suspicion that they might in fact be a single species. However, comparable small divergences have been commonly estimated for several species-pairs believed to have diverged recently, in other bee taxa. For example, divergences found for COI-sequences by Dick et al. [
44
] and Nemésio et al. [
45
] between species pairs of orchid-bee (Euglossina) in South America were all below 2%, while Gibbs [
2

<tp:taxon-name>Lasioglossum</tp:taxon-name>
previously misinterpreted as a single species (with the lowest recorded value of 1.7%
)
. In 
<tp:taxon-name>Bombus</tp:taxon-name>
, such small genetic distances were found, also, among cryptic species in northern Europe ([
5
, 
10
], see also Table 
5 in
[

<tp:taxon-name>Bombus</tp:taxon-name>
in this study, it was higher, for example, than those obtained for seven other pairs of undisputed species in Asia, Europe, and South America (S3 Table). The fact that the smallest distance between a specimen of

Traditionally, discontinuity in variation among populations has been considered, both in morphological and molecular-based studies, as evidence that independently-evolving lineages are involved (for example [
29
]). In the barcoding context, average intra-population divergences much smaller than the inter-population divergences (the so called barcode gap—[
46
]) is considered evidence that they are cohesive sets of populations, isolated from each other. Much has been discussed in the literature about the reality and convenient thresholds of such a gap (for example [
46
]). However, there is some agreement that one is safe in recognizing different species when the barcode gap between them reaches the order of one magnitude, as in the case of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. n.</named-content>
Aproblem here is that large intra-specific divergence could not be expected for 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. n.</named-content>
, considering that it is represented by a small sample from a single site. However, the situation could be looked at from the other way around: 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
from sites more than 
1500 km
apart along the latitudinal gradient or from isolated populations in areas differing more than 
1500 m
in elevation did not show divergences as large as that found between populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. n.</named-content>
and those of

about 240 Km apart in lowland evergreen forests.

are reciprocally monophyletic also supports their recognition as separate species (for example [
47
]), as it suggests that each of them is a mutually-independent evolutionary lineage. It could be argued that the phylogenetic hypothesis produced here, being based on two linked genes (maternally-inherited mtDNA), may merely indicate a phylogeny for those genes, which may be different from the correct phylogeny of the species involved (for example [
48
]). Nevertheless, as pointed out by Williams et al. [
49
], this problem has not been detected for the use of COI in bumblebees and, moreover, 
mt
DNA may actually be more suitable for species delimitation than other molecular and morphological data [
50
].

<tp:taxon-name>Apidae</tp:taxon-name>

Espírito Santo state
(municipality of Linhares; [

). 
<tp:taxon-name>Bombus brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
does occur in southeastern 
Brazil
, in latitudes between those of Linhares and São Francisco de Itabapoana [
23
, 
28
, 
60
], but all these records (and additional localities represented in the 
UFMG
collection) refer to cloud forests (or their immediate vicinities) on the top of mountain chains, further inland. These mountaintop records represent populations which are isolated from those near the coast (

) by semi-deciduous forests in areas under climates with relatively long dry seasons (4–6 months)—the same kind of environment found in the gap between the humid northern area occupied by 
<tp:taxon-name>B

         <p>
Close relationship between elements of the 
Bahia
forest and the Amazonian Forest biotas has been pointed out for organisms such as birds (for example [
62
]) and also for orchid bees, with several pairs of presumed sister species of the latter occurring disjunctly in the two phytogeographic domains (for example [
54
, 
55
]). This may suggest that 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. n.</named-content>
could be sister to the only species in the genus restricted to Amazonia, 
<tp:taxon-name>B
.

[
23
]. However, this hypothesis is not supported by any of the results obtained here.
</p>
         <p>
The presumed range of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. n.</named-content>
also falls within a forest refuge that existed in the Atlantic Forest domain during cold, dry periods of the Pleistocene, the so-called 
Bahia
refuge, which was predicted by climatic models and validated by paleopalynological data (for example [
61
, 
63
, 
64
]). In the 
Bahia
refuge, limited in the south by the Doce river, in 
Espírito Santo
, and extending northward into southern 
Bahia
, evergreen forests persisted even in the driest periods of the Pleistocene. Carnaval et al. [
64
] predicted that surveys in this area would still reveal undescribed species and cryptic lineages. If Hines [
65
] is right in her estimate that the closest common ancestor of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>B
.

and

<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. n.</named-content>
lived in the Pleistocene, and this would be consistent with the hypothesis that the isolation of part of its populations in the 
Bahia
refuge during that period could be the vicariance event responsible for its genetic divergence. The close association of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. n.</named-content>
with evergreen forests in southeastern 
Brazil
suggests that interbreeding of their populations may have been prevented by their inability to settle in lowland semi-deciduous forests, which occur under climates with relatively long dry seasons and that reaches the coast between southern 
Espírito Santo
and northern 
Rio de Janeiro
states. It should be noted, however, that this hypothesis is weakened by the occurrence of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
in areas dominated by climates with relatively long dry seasons and covered with semideciduous forests along the 
Paraná
River valley, westward into 
Paraguay
and central 
Brazil
(

). Acloser look at the habitats used by this species in that region is necessary for a better understanding of this question.

         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Bombus</tp:taxon-name>
is a relatively monotonous genus, as far as morphological characters are concerned (for example [
1
]), and this makes them frequently difficult to distinguish, especially among closely-related species (for example [
5
– 
11
, 
49
]. Thus, it is not surprising that not a single exclusive autoapomorphy of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. n.</named-content>
could be found, and that the only morphological character distinguishing it from its presumed sister species, the black-haired T1, is a plesiomorphic trait or, at most, a homoplastic apomorphy, also found in all other Brazilian species but 
<tp:taxon-name>B

(for example [

</p>
         <p>
Moure &amp; Sakagami [
23

<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
from Linhares, by the northern margin of the Doce river, in 
Espírito Santo state
(shown by a grey triangle with a central black dot in

<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
. These specimens quite probably belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. n.</named-content>
and may represent the southernmost population of the species, since the Doce river is the southern limit for the evergreen forests of the 
Bahia
refuge and the 
Bahia
forest (although some authors, as Silva &amp; Casteleti [
51
] and Ribeiro et al. [
66

Bahia
forest to extend further south in 
Espírito Santo

Local or regional decline or extirpation of bumblebee populations has been reported in the northern hemisphere (for example [
49
, 
67
– 
70
]) and in 
Brazil
[
71
]. It seems that the small available sample of 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. n.</named-content>
reflects a low abundance in nature and not a small sampling effort in its habitat. The bee fauna of northern 
Espírito Santo
was intensively sampled by C. Elias, a collector for the DZOL collection in Curitiba in the 1960’s and early 1970’s, and the only specimens of the species collected among thousands of bee specimens, apparently are those few listed in the “Taxonomic treatment”. Moreover, two expeditions were set to southern 
Bahia
and northern 
Espírito Santo
to search for the species, during the development of this project (January and June/July, 2014), but resulted unsuccessful. With this in mind, two facts should be considered concerning the conservation of this new species: 1) its presumed geographic range is the smallest among all Brazilian 
<tp:taxon-name>Bombus</tp:taxon-name>
species; and 2) its natural habitat is under heavy anthropic impact—the rain forest that originally covered about 86% of the region, now covers only between 12% and 17% of it [
51
, 
66
]—and continues to be fragmented. Moreover, bees in general and bumblebees specifically may be more susceptible to fragmentation than other organisms, due to issues related to effective population size, social behavior, nesting, sex determination mechanisms etc. (see discussions in [
72
, 
68
]). Thus, 
<tp:taxon-name>B
. 
bahiensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. n.</named-content>
may actually be an endangered species and efforts should be made to map the remaining populations of the species and their abundances, better defining its current geographic range and conservation status.
