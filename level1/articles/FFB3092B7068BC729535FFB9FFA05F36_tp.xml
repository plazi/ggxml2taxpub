Parsley frogs (
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
) comprise the only genus in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytidae</tp:taxon-name>
, an ancient anuran lineage that split from their closest relatives over 140 million years ago. 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
is a Palearctic group restricted to 
Western
Eurasia including three extant species: the eastern species 
<tp:taxon-name>P. caucasicus</tp:taxon-name>
, endemic to the Caucasus area, and two closely related species inhabiting 
Western
Europe: the Iberian endemic 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
and the more widespread 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
.

Previous studies based on mitochondrial and nuclear 
DNA
markers have revealed the existence of two additional lineages of Parsley frogs in the Iberian Peninsula, which have been flagged as candidate species. Here, we integrate novel molecular, morphological and bioacoustical data to assess the differentiation of the four western Parsley frog lineages. Species trees and Bayesian population assignment analyses based on nuclear markers confirm previous studies and concordantly delineate four parapatric lineages with narrow hybrid zones. Mitochondrial divergence is low (&lt;2% pairwise distances in the 16S rRNA gene), in line with previously reported low mitochondrial substitution rates in non-neobatrachian frogs. Based on concordance between mitochondrial and nuclear markers, we conclude that four species of Parsley frogs occur in 
Western
Europe: 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
,

distributed from northern 
Italy
to northeastern 
Spain
; 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
, inhabiting southern 
Spain
and southern 
Portugal
; 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes atlanticus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, from the Portuguese Atlantic coast; and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes hespericus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, occurring in central and eastern 
Spain
. However, bioacoustical and morphological differentiation of these species is low, with no obvious and qualitative diagnostic characters allowing full species discrimination. Differences in the relative size of metacarpal tubercles exist but this character is variable. 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes atlanticus</tp:taxon-name>
are smaller than the other two species, and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
has shorter limbs and various distinctive osteological characters. Bioacoustically, the pattern by which two different note 
types
are combined in advertisement calls separates 
<tp:taxon-name>P. hespericus</tp:taxon-name>
from the remaining species. Despite these differences, we emphasize that the taxonomic status of all four western Parsley frogs requires additional investigation, especially the patterns of genetic admixture across contact zones. While a status of separate species best conforms to the currently available data, alternative hypotheses are also discussed.

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>
Recognition of species as independent evolutionary lineages (de 
Queiroz 1998
, 
2007
), rather than based on alternative species concepts, has been paramount for the development of integrative taxonomic approaches (
Dayrat 2005
), leading to improved operational protocols for species delimitation (
Sites &amp; Marshall 2003
; 

Padial 
et al.
2010

; 
Camargo &amp; Sites 2013
; 
Miralles &amp; Vences 2013
; 

Carstens 
et al.
2013

). The understanding of speciation as a lineage splitting process, with subsequent accumulation of emerging properties acquired during the course of independent evolution, has also served to define more clearly the sources of discordance among taxonomists. At what level of lineage splitting should diverging entities be recognized as species? Almost necessarily, there will be a vast number of incipient species that many taxonomists would fail to recognize—and name—as separate specieslevel entities, even if some of the properties required by different species criteria are met.
</p>
         <p>
From a molecular perspective, species delimitation approaches based on a single locus tend to be misleading because of the pervasiveness of discordance among gene trees and species tree. Genealogies do not always match the speciation process due to recent divergence, hybridization, recombination, gene duplication and loss (
Degnan &amp; Rosenberg 2009
). This undermines approaches relying on a single locus, especially for mtDNA, which is prone to showing genealogical discordance with respect to population history (e.g. see 
Ballard &amp; Whitlock 2004
). Focusing just on herpetology, there are multiple examples of deeply divergent, co-occurring mitochondrial lineages (

Zhang 
et al.
2008

; 

Hauswaldt 
et al.
2011

; Vences 
et al.
2013) suggesting patterns of recurring divergence and admixture, and of inter-species hybridization and mitochondrial introgression (
Babiket al.
2003

; 
Zamudio &amp; Savage 2003
; 

Renoult 
et al.
2009

; 

Liu

Komaki

; 

Jezkova 
et al.
2013

; 

Zielinski 
et al
. 2013

; 

Barrow 
et al.
2014

). Ring species, such as North American 
<tp:taxon-name>Ensatina</tp:taxon-name>
salamanders, also challenge classical species delimitation attempts (e.g., 
Wake
1997

; 

Kuchta 
et al.
2009

; 

Pereira 
et al.
2011

; 

Devitt 
et al.
2011

; 

Monahan 
et al.
2012

), as do other cases of local speciation processes blurred by hybridization (e.g., 

MacLeod 
et al.
2015

). Islands provide further examples of genealogical discordance where founder effects or rapid adaptation to new environmental conditions can lead to the coexistence of different entities in the absence of substantial genetic divergence and, often, in absence of evident reproductive barriers other than the sea (

Grazziotin 
et al.
2006

). Whether in such cases a species status is warranted or a renaissance of the subspecies category is needed remains a controversial topic (

Hawlitschek 
et al.
2012

). Leaving aside these borderline cases, it remains true that species diversity is often underestimated, especially in “non adaptive” or “cryptic” evolutionary scenarios (

Bickford 
et al.

Funk

</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Pelodytidae</tp:taxon-name>
is a relatively ancient family of anurans with a scarce number of taxonomic representatives in a single described genus: 
<tp:taxon-name>PelodytesBonaparte, 1838</tp:taxon-name>
. According to molecular timetrees, the divergence of pelodytids from their sister group (pelobatids+megophryids) took place more than 140 million years ago (mya) (

Roelants 
et al.
2007

), as reflected in deep differences in karyological characters (

Morescalchi 
et al.
1977

). Pelodytid morphology is characterized by several plesiomorphic character states (

Sanchiz 
et al.
2002

; 
Garriga &amp; Llorente 2011
) and some physiological characters are also interpreted as plesiomorphic (
Cardellini &amp; Sala 1987
), in agreement with the placement of this family outside of the derived crown group of anurans (the neobatrachians) (
Duellman &amp; Trueb 1986
; 
Ford &amp; Cannatella 1993
; 

Irisarri 
et al.
2012

). Species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytidae</tp:taxon-name>
are restricted to the 
Western
Palearctic region; they occur in the north Mediterranean and Caucasus areas, occupying the mesothermal climate zone (
Escoriza &amp; Ruhí 2014
). According to current taxonomy, they comprise three extant species: 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes caucasicusBoulenger, 1896</tp:taxon-name>
, with a patchy distribution of isolated and threatened populations extending from the eastern shores of the Black Sea to the northern slopes of the Caucasus, occurs in northwest 
Azerbaijan
(in the Belokany part of Zakatala State Reserve), 
Georgia
(southwest and 

South 
Ossetia
) and 
Russia
(
Krasnodar
district) to its southern limit in north 
Turkey
(
Steiner 1968
; 

Darevsky 
et al.
1971

; 
Kuzmin 1997
; 
Iskanderov 2009
; 

Iğci 
et al.
2013

). 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes ibericusSánchez-Herráiz, Barbadillo, Machordom &amp; Sanchiz 2000</tp:taxon-name>
, is endemic to the southern Iberian Peninsula (
Portugal
and 
Spain
), occurring in populations associated with temporary ponds in the Mediterranean bioclimatic region from Alentejo to 
Andalusia
, occupying almost the entire southern areas except the easternmost provinces (
Crespo &amp; Oliveira 1989
; 
Barbadillo 2002a
; 

Ceacero 
et al.
2007

). Finally, 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes punctatus
(
Daudin, 1802
)
</tp:taxon-name>
is discontinuously distributed from the Iberian Peninsula, in central and southwestern 
Portugal
, eastern and central 
Spain
, to 
France
and northwestern 
Italy
(
Barbadillo 2002b
; 
Salvidio &amp; Bologna 2007

</p>
         <p>
The fossil record of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
documents the distribution of this genus in Europe from the Eocene to the Holocene (
Roček &amp; Rage 2000
; 
Sanchiz 1998a
; 

Lobo 
et al.
2016

), and initial divergence among species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
is ancient (

Sánchez-Herráiz 
et al.
2000

; 

García-París 
et al.
2003

; 

Veith 
et al.
2006

). The vicariance of Iberian and Caucasian 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
, estimated around the Oligocene—Miocene boundary (about 24 mya) (Sánchez- 
Herráiz 2004
; 

Veith 
et al.
2006

), roughly coincides with splits in other similarly distributed amphibian taxa, like 
<tp:taxon-name>Chioglossa lusitanica</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Mertensiella caucasica</tp:taxon-name>
(

Veith 
et al.
1998

; 

Steinfartz 
et al.
2000

). The fossil taxon 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes arevacusSanchiz, 1978</tp:taxon-name>
, considered an early extinct member of the western 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
clade, has been recovered from the Miocene in the Iberian Peninsula (
Sanchiz 1978
, 
1998b
; 

Sanchiz 
et al.
2002

). Additionally, fossils morphologically ascribed to modern 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
have been reported from sites in southeastern 
France
from 4.2–3.2 mya (Blain 2009).
</p>
         <p>
The genus was also present in the Miocene in other parts of Europe (
Roček 2005
) and one plausible biogeographical explanation is that the Iberian Peninsula has been a refugium and center of speciation for 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytidae</tp:taxon-name>
since the Miocene (
Sanchiz 1978
), allowing for the recolonization of part of western Europe during the Pleistocene from the Iberian source (

García-París 
et al.
2003

). On the other hand, the absence of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
in north Africa (

Mateo 
et al.
2003

) supports the hypothesis that this genus colonized southern 
Spain
when the Strait of 
Gibraltar
was already a functional biogeographical barrier (
Busack 1977
).
</p>
         <p>
Until the late twentieth century, all 
Western
European populations of the genus were assigned to a single species, i.e., the Common Parsley frog 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus
(

Arnold 
et al.
1978

)
</tp:taxon-name>
. After the initial discovery of bioacoustic differences between French and Italian 
versus
southern Iberian populations (

Paillette 
et al.
1992

), detailed comparisons of morphology, osteology and allozymes led to the description of southern Iberian Parsley frogs as a new species, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus
(

Sánchez-Herráiz 
et al.
2000

)
</tp:taxon-name>
. The distinctiveness of this species was subsequently confirmed by several additional studies (

Pargana 
et al.
2003

; 

García-París 
et al.
2003

; 

Veith 
et al.
2006

; 

Crespo 
et al.
2008

; van de 

Vliet 
et al.
2012

), although detailed analyses of contact zones between 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
were lacking until recently. Fine-scale genetic studies have revealed that the pattern of genetic differentiation in Parsley frogs in 
Iberia
is more complex than previously thought, with two additional lineages, suggesting a history of allopatric differentiation in multiple refugia during the Plio-Pleistocene with recent secondary contact between them (

Díaz-Rodríguez 
et al.
2015

).
</p>
         <p>
In the present study, we examine the differentiation among western lineages of Parsley frogs in detail, integrating molecular, bioacoustic and morphological approaches. This complex of species poses important problems to taxonomists due to the apparent lack of clear-cut bioacoustic and morphological differences, combined with low mitochondrial divergences among lineages, which are however congruent with population assignments based on independent nuclear gene sequences. Considering all available evidences, we conclude that two undescribed species-level taxa of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
exist in the Iberian Peninsula; these are here described as new species.

         <p>Fieldwork, sampling and external morphological measurements.
For the molecular genetic study 98 individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
were sampled from a total of 45 localities distributed across the 
Western
European range of the genus, including sites from the Iberian Peninsula, 
France
and northern 
Italy
(

). Sample collection was completed in different fieldwork campaigns carried out from 
2003 to 2014
. Tadpoles were collected during the day by dipnetting in temporal ponds, following a protocol of asepsis to avoid biological contamination between sites.
</p>
         <p>Adults were collected at night using torches and headlamps and frequently guided by the male advertisement call. We collected samples by tail- or toe-clipping from one to five individuals per population, releasing animals immediately in the place of capture (Supplementary Table S1). Tissue samples were preserved in ethanol or frozen.</p>
         <p>
Morphometric measurements were taken from 185 ethanol-preserved specimens from 55 populations (Supplementary Table S2), including vouchers from the natural history museums in Pittsburgh (CM: Carnegie Museum), 
Lisboa
(
MUHNAC

<tp:taxon-name>Museu</tp:taxon-name>
Nacional de História Natural e da Ciência),

MNHN

ZFMK
: Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum A. Koenig), München (
ZSM
: Zoologische Staatssammlung) and newly collected specimens deposited in Sevilla (
EBD
: Colección Científica de la Estación Biológica de Doñana-CSIC). Only specimens with complete datasets available (i.e., all measurements and reliable geographical information) were included in the morphometric analysis. The following morphological measurements were taken by JDR or MV with calipers to the nearest 
0.1 mm
: snout-vent length (SVL), maximum head width (HW), head length (HL), horizontal eye diameter (ED), eye-nostril distance (END), nostril-snout tip distance (NSD), nostril-nostril distance (NND), horizontal tympanum diameter (TD), hand length (
HAL
), foot length (FOL), foot length including tarsus (
FOTL
), forelimb length (
FORL
), tibia length (TIL) and hindlimb length (HIL). Terminology and variable descriptions follow 

Sánchez-Herráiz 
et al.
(2000)

and Vences 
et al.
(2010). The majority of specimens of lineage D and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. caucasicus</tp:taxon-name>
were measured by MV and the remaining specimens by JDR; to minimize observer effects we therefore included only these specimens in the morphometric analysis, implying that comparisons between the three endemic Iberian lineages (
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
and the two new species described herein) are fully comparable. Measurements of all specimens and observer information are given in Supplementary Table S2.
</p>
         <p>
For detailed assessment of morphology and as 
type
series of new taxa, a small number of representative voucher specimens were euthanized in a MS222 solution following the manufacturer’s instructions, fixed in 5% formaldehyde, and preserved in 70% ethanol. Tissue samples of these specimens were taken before fixation by cutting pieces of muscle from the shank, and preserved separately in 70% ethanol. Specimens were sexed based on size and presence of nuptial pads, when present. Statistical analysis of morphological variables was performed in Statistica 7.1 (Statsoft Inc., 2007). We analysed males and females separately. Original measurements were sizecorrected dividing them by SVL. We then performed for each size-corrected variable, and separately for males and females, pairwise Mann-Whitney U-tests and summarized all those variables that showed significant differences in each pairwise comparison, applying Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. For the graphical representation of data, we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and constructed scatterplots with the first three PCs.
</p>
         <p>Bioacoustic analysis.
For bioacoustic analysis we recorded advertisement calls from 
Portugal
(Mindelo, 
Coimbra
, São 
Salvador
, Castro Verde, Mértola and Vila do Bispo) and 
Spain
(Córdoba, Burgos, Sevilla, Jaén, Málaga, Almería, Barcelona and 
Valencia
), and retrieved published recordings from 
France
in websites (see Supplementary Table S3). We also analyzed recordings kindly provided by Almudena González (Fonoteca Zoológica Nacional: www.fonozoo.com, Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, 
CSIC
), Eloísa Matheu and Richard G. Bowker. Our new recordings were made with professional grade microphones and recorders, and saved as uncompressed files. Microphones included Sennheiser ME 60 and recorders included Marantz PMD 221, Sony Walkman WMD6-C cassette, Sony TC-D8 DAT and Nokia C7-00. Substrate water temperature at the exact location where 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
calling males emitted was measured with either a Miller and Weber quick-recording thermometer or with a Fluke 52 thermocouple thermometer (precision 0.1°C). Not all recorded males could be captured but, for those that were, SVL was measured to the nearest mm by pressing the frog flat (ventral side) against a ruler. All the analogue recordings obtained were converted to digital format (41 KHz and 16 bit) with a Digi 0 0 1 or a Delta 66 digitizing board and were subsequently analyzed using Raven software (Cornell University) at the facilities of Fonoteca Zoológica Nacional.
</p>
         <p>
In most cases, except where otherwise stated, our call descriptions refer to the entire available recording (or a large part of it) from a single individual (the call voucher). Given the difficulty and the time necessary for locating calling males, we preferred obtaining recordings of good quality of an unambiguously identified calling male (i.e., vocal sac seen moving during call emission) than recording multiple individuals. However, for all species, additional individuals were heard in the field and found to agree in the relevant call characteristics with the recorded ones (frequency, note duration and composition of syntax). Air temperature was recorded using different digital thermometers; temperature information refers to air temperature at the time of recording or water temperature of the calling specimens (see Supplementary Table S3). Body temperature was also measured for some of these recorded males. More specific information on recording equipment and methods for some of the data have been previously described (Paillete 
et al.
1992; 
Pargana 1998
; 

Sánchez-Herráiz 
et al.
2000

; 

Márquez 
et al.
2001

; 

Pargana

).
</p>
         <p>
Exploratory data analysis suggests that differences between lineages and species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
are comparatively low for bioacoustic characters often used in taxonomy, such as call rate, note duration, or dominant frequency. Furthermore, the available data are too scarce and limited to perform detailed statistical comparisons after correcting for the influences of temperature and body size. Therefore, we decided to compare species based on the main advertisement call structure, which is the feature already highlighted by 

Paillette 
et al.
(1992)

, 
Pargana (1998)
and Sánchez-Herráiz (2004) and that could be species-specific, also among closely related species, and it is furthermore known to differ between 
<tp:taxon-name>P. caucasicus</tp:taxon-name>
and the species of the western clade. Unlike the advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. caucasicus</tp:taxon-name>
, which is composed of three notes in a fixed sequence, the calls of all 
Western
European 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
consist of two note 
types
that are arranged in series of specific syntax, or are emitted (more rarely) as single-note calls. These note 
types
are here named 
A
and 
B
. Mostly they are arranged in 
AB
series, sometimes followed by additional 
B
notes, and sometimes a single 
A
note is emitted. In order to assess differences in the arrangement of notes per call, we analyzed all available recordings and counted: (i) the number of calls consisting of isolated 
A
notes, and (ii) the number of calls consisting of, respectively, one note 
A
followed by one or more notes of 
typeB
, i.e., the number of 
AB
calls, 
ABB
calls, 
ABBB
calls, up to 
ABBBBBBBBB
calls. Furthermore, we also summarized (iii) the proportion of 
AB
series, independent of the number of additional 
B
notes by which they are followed, relative to single-note calls, and (iv) the average number of 
B
notes following 
AB
series. For the analysis, we attempted to discriminate individuals separately, although, from some recordings, to determine the number of calling individuals and assign each call to one of the individuals presented inherent difficulties. We observed differences in total number of notes related to body temperature. So, we attempted to increase time of the recording measured at low temperature to use a similar average number of notes. Statistical analysis was also performed in Statistica 7.1 and we undertook every effort to use one calling individual and the proportion of note 
types
in its call as the sampling unit for analyses.

In a previous study, 

Díaz-Rodríguez

(2015)

analyzed 391 individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
from 162 localities, for two mitochondrial and two nuclear markers. In the present study, we selected 98 individuals from representative populations covering the range of the western lineages identified by 

Díaz-Rodríguez 
et al.
(2015)

(

). Samples were selected so that they included populations from the core of the range of all lineages, but in addition, we focused on all putative contact zones among lineages. Therefore, admixed populations and hybrid individuals are overrepresented in our data set, compared to their overall scarcity in

PCR products were enzymatically purified with the ExoSap-IT purifying kit (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech), Exonuclease I and Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase, or Antarctic Phosphatase, or Montage PCR columns (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and clean products were subsequently cycle-sequenced in both directions using dye-labeled dideoxy terminator chemistry (BigDye 3.1 and 
ABI

ABIPRISM

DNA
sequencers (Applied Biosystems). Chromatograms and sequences were checked by eye, edited and manually corrected using Bioedit v7.2.5 (
Hall 1999
) or CodonCode Aligner 5.1.4 (CodonCode Corp.); protein-coding sequences were aligned by hand and translated into amino acids for authentication; non-coding sequences were aligned with the Muscle algorithm under default settings implemented in Mega 6 (

Tamura 
et al.
2013

). Polymorphic positions corresponding to heterozygous individuals in nuclear loci were coded with 
IUPAC
ambiguity codes. In all nuclear markers, regions in the alignment that could not be unambiguously edited or aligned due to the presence of indels or of short repeats were excluded prior to further analyses (reported alignment sizes take into account exclusion of these sites). Nuclear gene segments were separated into haplotypes using the Phase algorithm (

Stephens 
et al.

; 
Stephens &amp; Donnelly 2003
) as implemented in DnaSP 4.1 (
Librado &amp; Rozas 2009

We assessed the probability of recombination in nuclear 
DNA
sequences with Topali v2.5 (

Milne 
et al.

), using the difference of sums of squares (DSS) method with a sliding window of 500-bp and 10-bp step size (100 bootstraping threshold runs), and the PhiTest implemented in Splitstree v4.2 (
Huson &amp; Bryant 2006
). We did not find statistically significant evidence for recombination in nuclear sequences, therefore deemed adequate to use them for phylogenetic analysis.
</p>
         <p>Species delimitation.
In order to delineate independent evolutionary lineages, we assembled three different molecular datasets: (1) a combined alignment of the two mitochondrial genes mt-CYB and mt-ND4 (1493 bp) to identify major mitochondrial lineages; (2) a set of all available nDNA loci for the median-joining networks and population assignment tests using the software Structure; and (3) a combined mtDNA/nDNA dataset for estimation of the species tree, obtained after excluding all samples previously identified as potential hybrids by the Structure analysis or collected from putative secondary contact zones. Additionally, (4) we used partial sequences of the mitochondrial 16S and mt-CO1 genes from four individuals to estimate pairwise sequence divergences among the four major mtDNA lineages.
</p>
         <p>
In a first step, we explored our dataset by comparing mtDNA haplotypes (dataset 1) and nDNA (dataset 2) following the approach suggested by 

Weisrock 
et al.
(2010)

. This approach seeks concordance between mtDNA clades and nDNA population clustering and was found to outperform other species delimitation approaches by 
Miralles &amp; Vences (2013)
. Median-joining networks were constructed using Network v4.612 software (Fluxus Technology, http://www.fluxus-engineering.com/). For mtDNA, assignment of haplotypes to lineages was also determined by phylogenetic algorithms, as implemented in HapView v4.2 (

Salzburger 
et al.
2011

). Phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes were estimated using a Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach with RaxML v7.2.7 (
Stamatakis 2006
) on the Cipres Science Gateway V. 3.1 (
Silvestro &amp; Michalak 2010
). Each marker was analyzed as an independent partition, with nucleotide substitution models selected by jModeltest v 2.1.1, based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (

Darriba 
et al.
2012

). Genetic distances (p-uncorrected) within and between major clades were calculated with Mega 6 (

Tamura 
et al.
2013

).
</p>
         <p>
We analyzed nDNA data with the Bayesian population assignment algorithm implemented in the software Structure v2.3.4 (

Pritchard 
et al.
2000

), avoiding any pre-clustering information for populations, with a data set for 52 individuals with unambiguous nuclear sequences and excluding individuals with a considerable amount of missing data (&gt; 90%). We used as input a genotype matrix of the sequence data (95 variable sites across 6 unlinked nuclear markers) that was generated using the software 
xmfa2struct
according to 

Falush 
et al.
(2003)

. To determine the optimal number of clusters (K), and after initial testing (10 independent replicates and 100,000 iterations for each K value), five independent simulations with 10,000 burn-in iterations and 1,000,000 iterations were performed using the linkage model, with correlated allele frequencies among populations and without spatial information. The optimal number of genetic clusters (K) was determined by comparing the log-likelihood of runs considering K values between 1 and 7 and, subsequently, by computing values of Delta K (

Evanno 
et al.
2005

), as implemented in Structure Harvester (Earl &amp; von 
Holdt 2012
). For visualization purposes, we combined values from different run replicates under the optimal K value with Clumpp as implemented in Clumpak (
Jakobsson &amp; Rosenberg 2007
; 

Kopelman 
et al.
2015

).
</p>
         <p>Species tree analysis.
Species trees were estimated using the multispecies coalescent-based method implemented in * 
BEAST
(
Heled &amp; Drummond 2010
). Since the coalescent model of * 
BEAST
does not account for migration as a source of genealogical discordance, we used the Structure results, haplotype networks and geographic information to exclude from the dataset individuals and localities identified as potentially admixed. All individuals from populations in a putative secondary contact zone or where mtDNA haplotypes from different lineages were found in sympatry were thus excluded.
</p>
         <p>
We estimated two species trees, one using the complete dataset (mtDNA + nDNA) and another one using only the nuclear loci. For each locus, we selected the substitution model using jModeltest under the Bayesian Information Criterion. We used a Yule speciation prior with a strict clock model for all loci. Exploratory runs using relaxed clock models resulted in poor chain mixing and low effective sample sizes. Also, the posterior distribution of the standard deviation of the molecular clock rate (ucld.stdv) included zero, suggesting than the strict clock model provides a good fit for these markers. To calibrate the species trees, we set a normal prior for the age of the root based on fossil evidence as available in 
Böhme &amp; Ilg (2003)
(fosFARbase, &lt;http://www.wahre-staerke.com/&gt;). According to this information (see Introduction), we set the mean of this prior distribution at 3.5 mya with a SD of 1 mya. We also truncated the normal distribution at 3.5 mya to force the roots of both trees to be equal or older than this date. For each of the two species tree analyses, four independent 
MCMC
chains with different seeds were run for 100 million generations. Trees and other parameters were sampled every 10,000 generations. We used Tracer 1.6 (

Rambaut 
et al.
2014

) to check for adequate mixing and convergence of results across runs. We summarized the results in TreeAnnotator with 10% burn-in, and visualized them using FigTree v1.4.1 (&lt;http:// tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/&gt;).

sequences and genetic diversity.

Amplification of mtDNA (mt-CYB and mt-ND4) was successful in 90 from a total of 98 individuals selected for this study, yielding a mitochondrial 
DNA
alignment of 1493 bp with 55 unique haplotypes (154 variable and 132 parsimony-informative sites). Additionally, a different number of individuals were sequenced for RAG1 (1309 bp), 
KIAA
1239 (801 bp), 
β-
fib 
int7
(752 bp), PPP3CA 
int4
(with a short fragment of 393 bp and a large fragment of 935 bp), RPL3 
int5
(637 bp) and Cherp 
int7
(676 bp). Supplementary Table S1 lists all the individuals sequenced for each marker. Genetic distances between lineages and estimates of genetic diversity are shown in 
Tables 1
and

, respectively. The average number of pairwise sequence differences (percent of uncorrected p-distances) between the four major mtDNA clades in two mitochondrial gene segments, commonly used for 
DNA
barcoding of amphibians, 16S and mt-CO1 (e.g., 

Vences 
et al.
2005

) ranged from 0.8% to 1.7% for 16S, and from 4.1% to 6.7% for mt-CO1. 

Díaz-Rodríguez 
et al
. (2015)

reported interspecific pairwise sequence differences (p-distance values) from 3.3% to 4.5%, and intraspecific values from 0.1% to 0.6% for mt-CYB+mt-ND4. Haplotype diversity was higher in 
β-
fib 
int
7 than in the other nuclear loci and values of nucleotide diversity were low, especially in 
KIAA
and RAG1; for the combined fragment of mt-CYB and mt-ND4 we found considerable levels of genetic diversity (

The geographical distribution of our sampling (

) and the median-joining network for mtDNA haplotypes (

) reveal that haplotypes clustered into four well-differentiated geographical groups, here named haplogroups A, B, C and D. These results fully correspond to the tree-based analysis of the previous study (

and a second one restricted to Southern

. Haplogroup A occurs in localities scattered along the Atlantic coast of 
Portugal
and its haplotypes showed some structure corresponding to populations from northern vs. southern 
Portugal
. Haplogroup C occurred in the south, center and east of the Iberian Peninsula, intercalated between the distribution ranges of haplogroups B and D. In some populations, two different haplogroups were found (i.e., mitochondrial haplotypes of two lineages co-occurring in the same population), especially in areas of close geographic proximity between them (haplogroups A+B, populations 8, 9, 10, 11; and haplogroups B+C, populations 22 and 23). We did not find localities with mtDNA haplotypes of haplogroups C+D occurring in sympatry.

Molecular species delimitation based on nuclear 
DNA
.

Haplotype networks based on nuclear sequences are shown in 

, with samples colored according to each of the four mtDNA haplogroups. Results were largely congruent but instances of cyto-nuclear discordance were observed. Individuals with mtDNA of one haplogroup and nuclear alleles of a different one occurred in essentially the same localities in which co-occurrence of different mtDNA haplogroups was also observed (Supplementary Table S1; 

).
</p>
         <p>
According to the population assignment analysis of Structure, the mean log-likelihood value and Delta K were clearly higher for K = 4, indicating that this is the optimal number of genetic clusters for the nuclear data. The four clusters match closely the four mtDNA haplogroups (

). Concordant results were obtained in five independent replicates of the analysis. When running the analysis with K=5, 6, or 7, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sensu stricto</named-content>
was divided into two clusters, corresponding to the two mitochondrial subgroups in this species (

). In the K=4 analysis (

), a number of individuals, belonging to putative secondary contact zones, had intermediate assignment probabilities to more than one genetic cluster, suggesting admixture/hybridization. These include localities with a considerable degree of admixture between adjacent lineages: 7 to 11 (lineages A+B), 23 (lineages B+C), and 36–37 (lineages C+D). Lower levels of admixture (less than 25%) were also observed in localities far from putative contact zones (localities 28 and 44), which are interpreted as uncertainty in population assignment resulting from incomplete lineage sorting.

Altogether 9–10 individuals could potentially represent hybrids based on these results, especially for one individual with nDNA and mtDNA discordance (blue with haplogroup B in figure 3) from Mestanza (locality 23), where individuals assigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
and lineage C were found in strict sympatry (

Díaz-Rodríguez 
et. al
2015

). Although this appears to be a high proportion, it needs to be emphasized that the specimens from putative contact zones included in the present study had a high representation (&gt;30%) because we were particularly interested in identifying the occurrence and extent of hybridization. Considering the entire range of the species, admixed populations and hybrid individuals are rare (

Díaz-Rodríguez 
et al.
2015

) and likely only present in contact zones.
</p>
         <p>
As suggested by 

Weisrock 
et al.
(2010)

, concordant placement of individuals by (i) mitochondrial 
DNA
phylogeny and (ii) Structure clustering results is an indication for evolutionary independence of lineages and, thus, of species status. The fact that the four clusters of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
can be reliably identified by nuclear gene sequences, except for a limited number of individuals from their geographical contact zones, suggests that they are good candidates for representing independent evolutionary lineages, justifying their recognition as distinct species below.

         <p>FIGURE 3.
Clustering results of Bayesian assignment analyses using Structure, based on nuclear DNA sequences with the number of clusters K ranging from 1 to 7. Each individual is represented as a vertical bar partitioned into K colored segments, whose length is proportional to the individual’s estimated group membership coefficient. The enlarged figure shows the results for K=4, with population numbers as in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1. Population numbers on the top are shown to highlight individuals with mixed ancestry, and the mitochondrial haplogroup (A-D) for each included individual is shown in the bottom. Individuals in the graph are ordered as in Supplementary Table S1. Note that the comparatively large number of putative hybrids is due to the overrepresentation of populations in the contact zones in our analysis, as compared with Díaz- Rodríguez 
et al.
(2015).
</p>
         <p>Species tree analysis.
The independent replicates of the species tree analysis produced convergent parameter estimates. Each replicate showed good chain mixing with high effective sample sizes for all parameters (&gt;500). Posterior probability values in the species tree estimated from mtDNA+nDNA sequences (

) reached values at internal nodes of 0.82 and 0.93, supporting the same topology as the analysis based only on nuclear genes for splits among the 
Western
Palearctic species.
</p>
         <p>
Previous divergence estimates have recovered 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
as the earliest split in the western species group, after the divergence of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. caucasicus</tp:taxon-name>
(

Sánchez-Herráiz 
et al.
2000

; 

Sanchiz 
et al.
2002

; 

García-París 
et al.
2003

, Díaz- 

Rodríguez 
et al.
2015

) with an average age between 3.3–3.7 mya. Our own divergence estimates agree with this estimate and date all splits within the western 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
to either the Pliocene or the Pleistocene. Using a fossil calibration (former fossils morphologically ascribed to 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
were reported in Sète, Cap de Lazaret, Hérault), we obtained an age around 3.8 mya (95% 
HPD
: 3.5–4.6 mya) for the initial split among western 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
lineages (

) in the Iberian Peninsula (including 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
) (PP = 1.00). The split of lineage A from the remaining lineages was recovered with a more recent age around 3 mya (95% 
HPD
: 2.2–4.0 mya). Lineages C and D were recovered as sister lineages, with an age for their split around 2.3 mya (95% 
HPD
: 1.1–3.4 mya), together forming the sister clade of the lineage A. The species tree estimated from nDNA sequences (

) resulted in similar splits but with lower support values, placing 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
as diverging from the rest of the Iberian 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
around 3.7 mya, followed by lineage A, which again was recovered as sister group of the other two major lineages (C and D). This hypothesis suggests an eastwards expansion from southern 
Iberia
, with stepwise differentiation during the Pliocene and upper Pleistocene.

The tree on the right shows the same topology as recovered in a species tree analysis based only on the six nuclear gene segments.
</p>
         <p>
On the other hand, repeating the analysis calibrated with an average anuran mtDNA substitution rate (no node constraint; substitution rate prior for mtDNA set at 1%), as often reported in the literature, recovered instead very young ages (&lt;1 mya) for all splits. However, these young divergence dates might be underestimated. In fact, as with several other archaic frog lineages, 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
are characterized by low mitochondrial substitution rates (e.g., 

Hoegg 
et al.
2004

; 

Irisarri 
et al.
2012

). Analyses assuming a slower rate (0.5% divergence per mya) result in divergence estimates of 1.7 mya for the initial split, and of 0.7 mya for the most recent split within the 
Western
Palearctic 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
(data not shown), thus still supporting Pleistocene divergences. A re-evaluation of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
fossils and the use of multiple such fossils, for calibration, is needed to obtain a more robust timetree estimate of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
in future studies.
</p>
         <p>Morphological differentiation.
Careful examination of voucher specimens did not yield any reliable and fully diagnostic qualitative morphological difference between any of the cryptic species of Parsley frogs. The genetically divergent 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes caucasicus</tp:taxon-name>
is morphologically distinct from the western lineage, e.g. by larger body size (SVL 
43.7–50.3 mm
vs. 
22.7–41.6 mm
according to examined specimens) and by the presence of more continuous warty longitudinal ridges on the back, but this species is not further considered here. Among the western species, we focused on subarticular tubercles, which have been previously found to differ among species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes
(

Sánchez-Herráiz 
et al.
2000

)
</tp:taxon-name>
. We noted a tendency for subarticular tubercles, being small and conical in lineages A and C, and in 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
vs. more rounded in lineage D (
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sensu stricto</named-content>
), and for metacarpal tubercles, showing different relative sizes among individuals belonging to some of the lineages. However, these differences were not obvious in all specimens and in a large series of specimens that we examined, a high amount of individual variation was noted (

).

Morphometric measurements were available from 
133 males
and 
44 females
of the four western lineages of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
(i.e., excluding 
<tp:taxon-name>P. caucasicus</tp:taxon-name>
). Original measurements are included in Supplementary Table S2, while a summary of the original measurements and ratios is given in 
Table 3
. For morphometric comparisons, we used a subset of specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
(lineage D) measured by MV and of the rest of lineages only those specimens measured by JDR, thereby maximizing the comparability among the three endemic Iberian lineages. It therefore needs to be taken into account that comparisons with lineage D (
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sensu stricto</named-content>
) might be compromised due to possible observer effects. Since our goal in this study is not a comprehensive morphometric comparison but, instead, the search for easily reproducible differences between species, we here rely mostly on simple comparisons of morphometric ratios against SVL. Pairwise univariate comparisons among the four western lineages of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
with Mann-Whitney U-tests (
Table 4
) revealed differences in numerous variables, but only a subset of these remained significant after Bonferroni correction. Comparisons were carried out separately in males and females and yielded overall congruent results. Considering Bonferroni-corrected results only, lineagse B (
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
)

and A were characterized by smaller body sizes than lineages C and D. Furthermore, 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
differed from the other three lineages in having shorter limbs, affecting the majority of variables related to fore- and hindlimb length, and by a relatively larger tympanum in males (

). A PCA on male values (including also 
<tp:taxon-name>P. caucasicus</tp:taxon-name>
) found the first two PCs explaining over 80% of the variance (
Table 5
). A scatterplot of PC1 and PC2 separated 
<tp:taxon-name>P. caucasicus</tp:taxon-name>
clearly from the western lineages along PC1, reflecting its larger body size (

). Also lineage C and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sensu stricto</named-content>
were weakly distinguished from lineages B (
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
) and A along the size factor, whereas 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
was the only species somewhat distinguishable from all others also along PC2, reflecting mostly differences in TD, ED, and limb length (

         <p>Bioacoustical differentiation.
Despite acoustical attributes reflecting the complex and elaborate mating calls in Parsley frogs, calls of all four western lineages of

are structurally similar, without qualitative differences

         <p>
In the field, we noticed apparent differences in note arrangements, previously reported in the literature, and thus we focused on the composition of 
A
and 
B
notes in a certain syntax or separately. Raw data are presented in Supplementary Table S3 (
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
N=32; Lineage D N=13; lineage A N=39; lineage C N=16). A main difference was that specimens of lineage C typically emitted stereotyped advertisement calls consisting of 
AB
, without additional 
B
notes following the 
AB
series, as were heard in the other lineages. These differences can be expressed statistically, as the average number of 
B
notes following an 
A
note in a series (

). In this value, differences among species are highly significant in an 
ANOVA
(F = 19.95, P &lt;0.001), and Tukey's post-hoc tests confirmed that lineage C differs from the other three lineages (P &lt;
0.001 in
all cases). Furthermore, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
differs weakly from lineage A by a larger average number of 
B
notes in note series (Tukey's post-hoc test, P = 0.022), and this difference might also hold in comparison to lineage D, with a P-value close to significance (P = 0.0565).
</p>
         <p>
Paillette 
et al.
(1992)

found differences in note arrangement among 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
from Algarve and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
from 
France
and 
Italy
. According to these authors, the northern populations (
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
) had a simple 
AB
syntax, whereas 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
emitted a variable number of 
B
notes following 
A
(see also 

Pargana 
et al.
2003

). Although in our analysis the number of 
B
notes repeated in calls of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
was lower than in 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
(

), this difference was not significant for lineage D, and we found the stereotyped 
AB
calls rather typical for lineage C. Yet, calls heard (but not recorded) from specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
near Vic (Girona, 
Spain
) in 
March 2016
were composed of single 
A
notes only (about 
10 specimens
heard calling during one hour). This lack of 
B
notes in this 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
population would rather be in agreement with the conclusion of a simple syntax in this species (

Paillette 
et al.
1992

), but it could also indicate intraspecific variation.

Márquez

(2001)

did not find evidence of an increment of the number of 
B
notes or call matching through male-male acoustical interactions in 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
, suggesting that social interactions are not the main cause of this variability. Phonotaxis tests, based on differences of the number of 
B
notes in a sequence, did not detect significant responses for attraction in females of lineage C (Sánchez-Herráiz 2004). The role of these differences in the note arrangements is not clear, nevertheless it could also be related to an increase of informative content through redundancy or other functions (see 
Narins &amp; Capranica 1978
).
</p>
         <p>Integrative species delimitation.
Although molecular, morphological and bioacoustical data revealed differences among the four western lineages of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
, the evidence is not fully conclusive. Molecular differentiation was congruent for mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Admixture and hybridization were observed in both sets of markers, but were apparently restricted to narrow contact zones, with no obvious introgression of nuclear or mitochondrial markers into the core ranges of each major lineage. Although the amount of mtDNA differentiation was low, the previous molecular species validation approach conducted by 

Díaz-Rodríguez 
et al.
(2015)

also supported the separation of the group into four distinct clades. Moreover, on the basis of the allozyme dataset analyzed by 

Sanchez-Herráiz 
et al.
(2000)

, populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
presented exclusive alleles at loci AAT, EST-2, GDH and LDH-2, and fixed differences at three loci (IDPH-1, ME-3, and MPI-2) with respect to the Spanish populations of lineages D (Barcelona) and C (Burgos, 
Valencia
) analyzed. 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sensu stricto</named-content>
, represented on 

Sanchez-Herráiz 
et al.
(2000)

by the population of Barcelona, presented exclusive alleles in two loci: ADH-2, and LDH-1, the latter in high frequency (91.7%), whereas lineage C, represented by the populations of Burgos and 
Valencia
, also presented exclusive alleles in loci ADH-2, EST-2, GDH (2 alleles), and HK-2. While sample sizes were relatively low, these results are consistent with our study, suggesting genetic differences across the four lineages.
</p>
         <p>
Morphological differentiation was limited to differences in size, limb length and tympanum diameter, with values overlapping among all lineages. In particular, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
differed morphometrically from the others, with some individuals, however, being less distinct (PCA, see 

); this agrees with the previously described morphological differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus
(

Sánchez-Herráiz 
et al.
2000

)
</tp:taxon-name>
. According to the osteological analyses conducted by 

Sanchiz 
et al.
(2002)

and Sánchez-Herráiz (2004), 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes caucasicus</tp:taxon-name>
retained the most plesiomorphic morphology, resembling in multiple character states the putative common ancestor of extant 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
species occurring in 
Iberia
. These authors, analysing a total of 38 characters in disarticulated skeletons of individuals representing all four lineages characterized herein, i.e., from populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
(28 individuals from Cádiz, Huelva and Córdoba), lineage A (six individuals from 
Porto
Covo), lineage C (eight individuals from Burgos, 
Madrid
, Segovia and 
Valencia
) and lineage D (seven individuals from El Garraf, Barcelona), concluded that there was a relatively low degree of evolutionary transformation in Iberian populations when using 
<tp:taxon-name>P. caucasicus</tp:taxon-name>
as the outgroup. However, interspecific differences in character states were found between 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sensu lato</named-content>
(which grouped populations here ascribed to lineages A, C and D) in, at least, 38 characters analysed in different skeletal parts: premaxillary, maxillary, nasal, sphenethmoids, frontoparietal, prootic, 
ramus paroticus
, pterygoid, vomer, parasphenoids, parahyoids, vertebrae, scapula, coracoid, clavicle, humerus, radioulna, ilium, ischium, femur, tibiofibula and tibiale-fibulare.
</p>
         <p>
In comparison to the other three western lineages, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
was characterized by several differences, especially at the cranial level: (i) frontoparietals narrower and the minimum distance between them larger; (ii) 
septum nasi
proportionalIy wider and much shorter; (iii) sphenethmoids shorter; (iv) hyobranchial skeleton of parahyoid shape with a wider angle between its anterior rods; and (v) compared to lineage C the cranium is shorter, wider, and more compact. On the other hand, the analysis of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sensu stricto</named-content>
presented unique divergences in cranial ossification: greater robustness and ossification of most of the elements forming the cranial lid and greater compaction of skull. While new comparative osteological studies with increased sample sizes, explicitly comparing populations of the four western 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
lineages, are needed, the levels of variation uncovered by 

Sanchiz 
et al.
(2002)

and Sánchez-Herráiz (2004) suggest that osteological characters may provide relevant taxonomic information and aid in species discrimination.
</p>
         <p>
Regarding mating call characteristics, Sánchez-Herráiz (2004) found additional differences in the percentage of 
B
vs. 
A
notes, dominant and fundamental frequency, duration of the call and number of pulses between lineage C individuals from 
Valencia
and Burgos and lineage B (
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
) from Córdoba. Similarly, 
Pargana (1998)
found a strong correlation between molecular (allozymes) and acoustic divergence (especially temporal parameters of 
A
and 
B
notes) between populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Portugal
, lineages A and B. According to our results, advertisement calls of all four lineages are characterized by an overall structural similarity but differ in details of note arrangements, distinguishing 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
from lineage A, but especially from lineage C by the absence of repetition of 
B
notes. This same feature might also distinguish some populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
according to Paillete 
et al.
(1992) although, on the basis of available recordings, we could not prove these results herein, neither in calls heard (not analyzed) from 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
specimens in Southern 
France
.
</p>
         <p>
Considering all the available evidence, should the lineages of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
occurring in the Iberian Peninsula be recognized as different species?

Clearly, the amount of morphological and bioacoustical divergence among lineages is low. Despite the examination of a large number of specimens, we could not unambiguously identify any qualitative diagnostic external morphological character, as typically occurs in cryptic species, although differences in sizes of webbing fringes along the males from different lineages might exist (easily visible in live specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
). Bioacoustic differences were found, especially in the rareness of 
B
note series in lineage C, although this is a quantitative character (
sensu
Vieites 
et al.
2009

). Patterns of variation in the acoustic properties of mating calls are related to patterns of female choice (
Gerhardt 1991
) and phonotaxis playback tests should be conducted to determine the role of female discrimination among the calls of different species and to investigate the possibility of reproductive character displacement, with mating calls representing an effective prezygotic mating barrier in secondary contact zones.
</p>
         <p>
The similar levels of mtDNA divergence (see 

) with the full concordance of mitochondrial and nuclear differentiation of the four lineages is a substantial argument supporting their evolutionary independence. However, compared with the generally high mtDNA divergences observed among species-level lineages in anurans, the pairwise divergences among 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
haplogroups were comparatively low: for the two genes typically used for 
DNA
barcoding in anurans, between-lineage divergences ranged from 4.1–6.7% in mt-CO1 and from 0.8–1.7% in 16S (
Table 1
). This mitochondrial differentiation is much below the threshold of 3% 16S divergence suggested by 

Fouquet 
et al.
(2007)

and 

Vieites 
et al.
(2009)

for preliminary recognition of candidate species. However, these divergence values need to be taken in context as the 3% threshold was based on empirical evidence from neobatrachian frogs that are characterized by a substantial acceleration of mitochondrial substitution rates, whereas 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
belongs to an ancient anuran clade with lower substitution rates (

Hoegg 
et al.
2004

; 

Irisarri 
et al.
2012

), estimated at 0.0065 site/mya (95% 
HPD
: 0.0047–0.0083) for the mtDNA fragments used herein. Furthermore, even in neobatrachians, 
Malone &amp; Fontenot (2008)
found postzygotic isolation in bufonid toads starting at mitochondrial divergences &lt;2.5%, and several undisputed species with low mitochondrial differentiation have recently been described (e.g., Vences 
et al.
2012; 

Mo 
et al.
2013

). A low level of mitochondrial differentiation among species appears to characterize numerous groups of non-neobatrachian anurans. In the 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelobatidae</tp:taxon-name>
, the sister group of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytidae</tp:taxon-name>
, several established and universally recognized species have similarly low divergence values, e.g., 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelobates cultripes</tp:taxon-name>
vs. 
<tp:taxon-name>P. varaldii</tp:taxon-name>
(0.9% 16S/12S rRNA divergence; 

Veith 
et al.
2006

), or 
<tp:taxon-name>Spea bombifrons</tp:taxon-name>
vs. 
<tp:taxon-name>S. intermontana</tp:taxon-name>
(2.3% mt-CO1 divergence) and 
<tp:taxon-name>S. bombifrons</tp:taxon-name>
vs. 
<tp:taxon-name>S. hammondii</tp:taxon-name>
(with values as low as 0.7% 16S divergence) (

García-París 
et al.
2003

).
</p>
         <p>
We conclude that, at the present, a species status for all four western lineages of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
is the hypothesis best fitting the available data, but we emphasize that future fine-scale studies, especially at putative secondary contact zones, are needed to better understand patterns of gene flow, as well as ecological differences between lineages. Although, based on current evidence and unpublished data on microsatellites (
Díaz-Rodríguez 2016
), hybrid individuals are rare and limited to very narrow admixed populations, as in other pairs of taxa (e.g., 

Oliveira 
et al.
1991

; 

Arntzen 
et al.
2009

; 

Colliard 
et al.
2010

), we cannot exclude that future studies may reveal wider patterns of introgression questioning species status.
</p>
         <p>
Names are available for two of the lineages (
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
), and the remaining two lineages are formally described as species in the taxonomic accounts below. However, we do not exclude that new studies might require adopting an alternative taxonomic scenario.
</p>
         <p>Evolution of western Palearctic Parsley frogs.
Our data confirm the existence of five independent evolutionary lineages of Parsley frogs and highlight the importance of the Iberian Peninsula as a refugium during climatic fluctuations specially in the Pleistocene. These climatic fluctuations may have consolidated a contemporary diversification process in western European 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
,

that probably started during the Pliocene (

Sanchiz 
et al.
2002

; 

García-París 
et al.
2003

; Sánchez-Herráiz 2004; 

Díaz-Rodríguez 
et al.
2015

).
</p>
         <p>
Previous osteological (including fossils) and genetic datasets (molecular clocks) provide a basic time frame for 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
differentiation. The most recent common ancestor (
MRCA
) of Iberian 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
probably lived between 3.3–3.8 mya (

Sanchiz 
et al
. 2002

) according to allozymes and mtDNA (

García-París 
et al.
2003

; Sánchez-Herráiz 2004). 

Sanchiz 
et al
. (2002)

, 

García-París 
et al.
(2003)

and Sánchez-Herráiz (2004) also indicated the existence of local differentiation within 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sensu lato</named-content>
,

with Catalonian populations being clearly divergent from the rest of peninsular populations analysed (Burgos, Teruel, and Toledo, thus representing lineage C). The species tree analysis herein (

), calibrated with fossils, recovered ages between 2.3–3.8 mya for the splits among the four lineages, with an estimated mtDNA rate (0.0065 site/mya; 95% 
HPD
: 0.0047–0.0083) in agreement with the slow mitochondrial substitution rates typical of non-neobatrachian frogs.
</p>
         <p>
Our preferred species tree, based on mtDNA and nDNA markers, suggests an ancient colonization of the southern Iberian Peninsula in agreement with previous studies (e.g., 

García-París 
et al.
2003

; Sánchez-Herráiz 2004; 

Veith 
et al.
2006

; Díaz 

Rodríguez 
et al.
2015

). Molecular data are in agreement with the fact that fossils of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
have been recovered in the Iberian Peninsula dating back to the Middle Pliocene, about 3.6 mya, and with their absence in Northern Africa (
Busack 1977
; 

Sanchiz 
et al.
2002

; 
Martínez-Solano &amp; Sanchiz 2005
; 

Blain 
et al.
2008a

, 
b
; Blain 
et al.
2009). Our species tree based only on nuclear 
DNA
sequences is also consistent with this biogeographic scenario, with a topology where 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
splits from a lineage containing the rest of Iberian 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
(

), although fossils ascribed to 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
do not date back further than the Pleistocene (

Lobo 
et al.
2016

). According to the current calibration, the inferred splitting times in 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
would be linked to paleogeographic events in the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The geographical ranges of the different species probably underwent cycles of demographic expansion and contraction related to the succession of glacial and interglacial periods, as evidenced by the widespread presence of fossil remains in 
Western
Europe, dating from the Middle and Upper Pleistocene (
Holman 1998
; 
Roček &amp; Rage 2000
; 
Delfino 2002
; 
Blain &amp; Bailon 2003
; 
Delfino 2004
). Considering the ages obtained in our analysis (e.g., 

) and the accumulating evidence for climate-related diversification processes in the Iberian Peninsula, especially in amphibians and water-dependent species (
Gómez &amp; Lunt 2007
; 
Abellán &amp; Svenning 2014
), scenarios involving separate Iberian refugia during climatic oscillations provide good null hypotheses to be further tested in future studies.

            <p>Identity.
Described as 
<tp:taxon-name>Rana punctataDaudin, 1802</tp:taxon-name>
, from a locality in 
France
("aux environs de Beauvais", Department Oise, northern 
France
) (
Frost 2015
). One synonym, 
<tp:taxon-name>Rana plicataDaudin, 1802</tp:taxon-name>
, from near Montpellier, 
France
(
Frost 2015
). We could not locate the 
type
specimens in the Paris museum (see also 
Frost 2015
), but a more intensive search of that and other French collections might be warranted to ascertain the fate of the 
types
of these two nomina. However, because the localities of both taxa are deeply in the range of the genetic lineage D, there is no doubt about the identity of this lineage with the name 
<tp:taxon-name>Rana punctata</tp:taxon-name>
, and the status of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rana plicata</tp:taxon-name>
as its junior synonym.

A medium sized frog with an average SVL of 
35.5 mm
(maximum SVL 
41.6 mm
) in males and 
38.8 mm
(51.0 mm) in females (
Table 3
). As all congeners its dorsal skin has tubercles and folds forming an irregular pattern of discontinuous dorsolateral folds, with considerable variation among individuals. Ventral side whitish, dorsally with irregular greenish dots and patches which typically are centered on the tubercles and folds, and sometimes extending around these. No webbing between fingers and weakly expressed between toes, except in males (where foot webbing are clearly expressed). Males with distinct nuptial pads on fingers and arms. Further morphometric values are summarized in 
Table 3

is widely distributed in 
France
, extending into northwestern 
Italy
(
Liguria
and 
Piedmont
) and northeastern 
Spain
(
Catalonia
) (
Le Garff 1989
; 
Salvidio &amp; Bologna 2007
). The northern limits are currently in the French department of 
Nord-Pas-de-Calais
, where its presence is rare and limited (
Duguet &amp; Melki 2003
). Fossil evidence indicates its existence further to the north in the past (Blain 
et al.
2014). In 
Italy
, it is distributed in coastal 
Liguria
(

Salvidio 
et al.
2004

), and in 
Piedmont
(
Boulenger, 1897
) where it has recently been rediscovered (
Andreone &amp; Sindaco 1998
; 

Sindaco 
et al.
2002

). In the Iberian Peninsula, it is restricted to the northeast, including eastern 
Catalonia
(
Martínez-Rica 1983
; 
Barbadillo 2002b
), where it reaches its maximum altitude in the Pyrenees (
2,000 m
; 
Borrás &amp; Polls 1987
; 

Guix 
et al.
2009

). In 
France
and 
Italy
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
inhabits plains (

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

; 

Salvidio 
et al.
2004

; 
Pottier 2008
), is absent from most of the French Pyrenees (
Boulenger, 1897
; 
Guyétant &amp; Geniez 2013
) and only exceeds elevations of 
1,000 m
in the Massif Central and in the Alpes Maritimes (
Salvidio &amp; Bologna 2007
). The fossil record suggests an ancient presence of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
at the east of its present distribution (
Blain &amp; Bailón 2003
; 
Delfino 2004
). The current distribution is roughly within the region of subtropical climate with dry summers in the Koppen-Geiger classification (

Peel 
et al.
2007

), and extends into the oceanic temperate region in western 
France
and the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula.

Numerous studies 

on 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
biology have been performed in 
France
, 
Italy
and 
northeastern Spain
and therefore the respective data can be reliably assigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
.

This encompasses general accounts on the biology of the species (e.g., 
Elzen 1975
, 
1976
), diet analysis of adults from 
Catalonia
(

Bea 
et al.
1994

), and diet preferences of tadpoles (

Richter-Boix 
et al.
2007

). Reproduction is related to an increase in seasonal rainfall and occurs early in the year, usually before that of other anuran species, with two breeding periods: one at mid-fall and another in late winter and spring (
Sindaco &amp; Andreone 1988
; 

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

; 

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

;

et al.
2005

; 

Richter-Boix 
et al.
2006

; 

Petitot 
et al.
2014

). Reproduction in autumn is often minor and irregular (

Cayuela 
et al.
2012

), however, in southern populations the breeding season extends all year round (
A. Montori
pers. com.). This reproductive strategy may reduce interspecific competition (

Jakob 
et al.
2003

; 

Richter-Boix 
et al.
2006

) and does not result in an inhibition of gene flow between early and late reproduction groups (

Jourdan-Pineau 
et al.
2012

). Breeding occurs in seasonal water bodies, mainly slow-flowing streams and ephemeral ponds located in cultivated areas, grasslands, shrubs and meadows (although the ponds often are more permanent than those used by 
<tp:taxon-name>P. atlanticus</tp:taxon-name>
                  <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
). The species is frequently found at the entrance of caves and karstic sites (
Elzen 1976
; 
Olague &amp; Lagares 2000
; Sánchez-Herráiz 2004; 

Blain 
et al.

; 
Vento &amp; Pérez 2011
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
tolerates high levels of salinity and shows a preference for clayeye soils as 
<tp:taxon-name>P. hespericus</tp:taxon-name>
                  <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
(but unlike 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
, see however 
Reques and Tejedo 2014
). Eggs are black and small (diameter 
1.5–2 mm
), arranged in strings of 
70–80 mm
length and containing 40
</tp:material-citation>
– 
<tp:material-citation>700 eggs
. Overall clutch size can be up to 1,600 eggs (
Boulenger, 1897
; 
Lanza 1983
; 

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

). Hatching success might be related to water oxygen content (

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

). The incubation period is 8–9 days at 14–20°C (
Nöllert &amp; Nöllert 1992
). Larvae reach metamorphosis in roughly two months but this period can be delayed to up to four months (
Sindaco &amp; Andreone 1988
; 

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

), and up to eight months in hibernating larvae (
Lataste, 1876
). Phenotypic plasticity in morphology and larval development has been documented (
Johansson and Richter-Boix 2013
). Males reach sexual maturity at one year of age and females at two years and longevity can reach 8 years (in males) and 10 years (in females), similarly to other species of the genus (

Esteban 
et al.
2004

, 

Erişmiş 
et al.
2011

). The sex ratio within a population is close to 1:1 (

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

). The 
IUCN
threat status of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
is 
Least Concern
(
Denoëlet al.
2009

); however, in the edge of its range (north of 
France
, 
Italy
and east of 
Spain
), the species is generally scarce and highly threatened, due to the loss of breeding sites, close to local extinction in some areas (

            <p>Advertisement call and reproductive behavior.
The advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
has been described by several authors (
Hotz 1971
; 
Elzen 1975
; Paillete 
et al.
1992). Several call parameters (e.g., call duration) were found to depend on the temperature (
Boulenger, 1897
; Paillete 
et al.
1992). As with all western 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
, the call consists of two notes (
A
and 
B
) and has been reported as typically containing only a single 
B
note following 
A
(

Paillette 
et al.
1992

). Our analysis shows that also sequences of several 
B
notes can be emitted following an 
A
(

), and it remains to be assessed by a more detailed study whether populational variation exists in the frequency of 
B
series. Males call from positions partially or even completely submerged in the water, and occasional episodes of mortality due to sudden drops in temperature have been observed (

Montori 
et al.
2011

).
</p>
            <p>
Males remain for a longer period of time than females at the breeding sites and show a marked philopatry (

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

). Female release calls have been mentioned by 
Elzen (1976)
. The amplexus is inguinal and usually lasts a few hours (

. The examined tadpole has an elliptical body, a narrowly rounded snout in dorsal view, protruding eyes from the surface of the body and a very short tail with a typical braided line pattern; and spiraculum sinistral. The distance between eyes is moderately wide and nares are very large, round, positioned high dorsally, and situated nearer to snout than to eye and below the eye level. Moderately wide oral disk (

), emarginated, upper labium is wider than lower labium, LTRF is 5(2–5)/5(1–3). The upper jaw sheath is partially keratinized with pointed serrations, moderately wide without medial convexity. The lower sheath is wide V-shaped, partially keratinized and partially hidden by the upper one. Both jaw sheaths have a smooth surface. This tadpole is characterized by the presence of a network of dark lines, as it is also typical for larvae of the anuran genera 
<tp:taxon-name>Bombina</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Discoglossus</tp:taxon-name>
, covering the whole body, in addition to the presence of sparse dark spots. The venter is transparent with irregularly spiral shape intestinal coils.

<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
reproduces in ephemeral water bodies, mainly temporary streams and seasonal ponds located around agricultural crops, grassland, scrub and oak from 
Mediterranean
savanna. 
It
tolerates some salinity, even at the larval stage, reproducing sometimes in salty coastal wetlands and inland brackish water lagoons (
Reques
&amp; 
Tejedo
2014

). 
It
tolerates a variety of substrates (siliceous, clay and calcareous). 
Phenological
changes occur in dry years (
Díaz-Paniagua
1989

; 
Sánchez-Herráiz
2004). 
Breeding
starts early in the season, avoiding interspecific competition (

Díaz 
Paniagua
1988), often during autumn rains (
October
– 
November
) in southern 
Portugal
and 
Western Andalusia
(

&amp; 
Rivas

March
at higher latitudes (
Badajoz

) and altitudes (
Sierra de Cabra
: 
Reques
&amp; 
Tejedo

; 
Sierra Morena

2000

). 
Sexual
maturity is reached at an age of one year (
Sánchez-Herráiz

Reques
2014). 
The
species is threatened by fragmentation and destruction of breeding habitat (

van de 
Vlietet al.

Salvador
&amp; 
García-París

Pargana 1998
; Sanchez-Herráiz 2004). Calling specimens are in or near the water, but they do not emit their vocalizations fully submerged. Reproductive activity takes place before and after sunset, mostly during rainy days accompanied by slight increases of environmental temperature, although they can also exhibit diurnal activity on rainy days (

Description of the 
holotype
.

Adult male in excellent state of preservation. Some tissue removed ventrally from right thigh for molecular analysis. Measurements: SVL, 33.0; HW, 11.6; HL, 11.0; TD, 1.9; ED, 3.6; END, 2.7; NSD, 2.6; NND, 2.3;

FORL
, 20.0; HIL, 52.6; FOL, 16.6; 
FOTL
, 25.4; TIL, 16.5. Body relatively slender; head dorsally flattened, slightly wider than longer, wider than body; snout slightly pointed in dorsal view, rounded and flattened in lateral view; nostrils directed dorsolaterally, slightly protuberant, nearer to tip of snout than to eye; canthus rostralis indistinct, straight; loreal region very slightly concave, almost flat; eye moderately large, notably protuberant dorsally; interocular distance slightly larger than horizontal eye diameter, larger than internarial and eye-nostril distance; pupil vertical; tympanum externally visible, distinct, oval, wider vertically than horizontally, its horizontal diameter being 68% of vertical eye diameter, positioned near corner of mouth; supratympanic fold distinct in its anterodorsal part running from posterior corner of eye to level of forelimb insertion; tongue free posteriorly, of truncated shape, vomerine teeth distinct, in two patches between and at the same level as choanae; choanae moderately sized, ovoid. Premaxillary and maxillary teeth present. Arms slender, webbing almost absent, very small rudiments recognizable; comparative finger length I&lt;II&lt;IV&lt;III, fingers with dermal fringes. No enlarged finger disks. One large, conical subarticular tubercle present proximally on each finger; three flattened metacarpal tubercles; inner and outer metacarpal tubercles of different size (outer slightly larger than inner) and distinctly larger than central tubercle. Black nuptial pads on inner sides of first and second fingers, as one elongate patch on forearm, a second slightly bigger elongate patch on arm, and a small agglomeration on both sides of chest near axilla. Hindlimbs slender; tibiotarsal articulation reaches between eye and nostril when adpressed along body; inner metatarsal tubercle distinct but relatively small, outer metatarsal tubercle absent; proximal subarticular tubercles indistinct, remaining subarticular tubercles absent. Comparative toe length I&lt;II&lt;V&lt;III&lt;IV; third toe distinctly longer than fifth toe; toes with conspicuous dermal fringes to tip. Webbing between toes weakly expressed but clearly present and more than merely an extension of dermal fringes. Webbing formula difficult to determine due to absence of subarticular tubercles and presence of dermal fringes. Skin on the dorsal surface granular, with distinct warts; skin of throat, chest, and venter smooth except granular on posterior most part of belly; ventral surfaces of thighs and arms granular. Especially those warts that coincide with dark greenish spots on dorsum of slightly elongated shape and arranged in longitudinal rows. The anterodorsal part of supratympanic fold is continued into the inguinal region as a distinct row of small tubercles and ridges.

            <p>
Colour of the 
holotype
: The skin colour is between dark gray to olive brown with drab green bands on the back and legs. The back is dotted with small round or oval prominences of olive colors. The ventral area, which is smooth or slightly rough, has a light colour from pale green to gray tones. Nuptial pads are grass green. Colour in life (

) is more clear with light greenish spots on the back and a design of a drab olive line from the eye to the insertion of anterior legs.

            <p>Natural history.
Poorly known. Reproductive phenology is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
and takes place early in the season, starting with the first rains at mid-autumn and extending into the winter. More detailed fieldwork is needed to determine the conservation status of populations in some regions (van de 

Vliet 
et al.
2012

; 

Nunes 
et al.
2014

). Given that suitable breeding habitats (i.e., temporary ponds in traditional Mediterranean farmland) are disappearing at an alarming rate in 
Portugal
(
Beja
&amp; Alcazar 2003

) affecting overall Mediterranean biodiversity (

Stoate 
et al.
2009

), it is urgent to assess the conservation status of this species and possibly implement conservation measures. In the Natural Reserve of Paul do Boquilobo (central 
Portugal
), the introduction of the American crayfish (
<tp:taxon-name>Procambarus clarkii</tp:taxon-name>
) resulted in the extinction of local populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. atlanticus</tp:taxon-name>
eight years later (

Premaxillary and maxillary teeth present. Arms slender, webbing almost absent, very small rudiments recognizable; comparative finger length I&lt;II&lt;IV&lt;III, fingers with dermal fringes (poorly recognizable on small fingers due to fixation). No enlarged finger disks. One large, rounded subarticular tubercle present proximally on each finger; three flattened metacarpal tubercles; inner and outer metacarpal tubercles of similar size and distinctly larger than central tubercle. Black nuptial pads on inner sides of first and second fingers, as one elongate patch on forearm, a second slightly smaller elongate patch on arm, and a small agglomeration on both sides of chest near axilla. Hindlimbs slender; tibiotarsal articulation reaches between eye and nostril when adpressed along body; inner metatarsal tubercle distinct but relatively small, outer metatarsal tubercle absent; proximal subarticular tubercles indistinct, remaining subarticular tubercles absent. Comparative toe length I&lt;II&lt;V&lt;III&lt;IV; third toe distinctly longer than fifth toe; toes with conspicuous dermal fringes to tip. Webbing between toes weakly expressed but clearly present and more than merely an extension of dermal fringes. Webbing formula difficult to determine due to absence of subarticular tubercles and presence of dermal fringes, but webbing almost complete between toes I and II, between second and third phalangeal joint of toe II between toes II and III. Skin on the dorsal surface granular, with distinct warts; skin of throat, chest, and venter smooth except granular on posteriormost part of belly; ventral surfaces of thighs and arms granular. Especially those warts that coincide with dark greeninsh spots on dorsum of slightly elongated shape and arranged in longitudinal rows.

On the lateral side, a clear band is more or less visible, from the tympanum to the insertion of posterior limbs. The ventral area, which is smooth or slightly rough, has a light colour from pale green to yellow tones. Colour in life is similar, with light greenish spots on the back, instead of drab colors, and a design of two crossed bands clear without dots (

Spain
. Its range extends mainly in areas of low and mid-altitude mountains, from the sea level to 
1,900 m
in 
La Rioja
(
Zaldívar 2004
), almost 
2,000 m
in Sierra Seca (
Granada
) and maybe higher at the locality of Castril, 
Granada
(

Fernández-Cardenete 
et al.

), but additional confirmation is required. It occupies most of the eastern and central parts of 
Spain
(Lacomba &amp; Sancho 1999; 
Barbadillo 2002b
). The western range limits are in the southeast of 
Madrid
(
Martínez-Solano &amp; García-París 2001
; 
Martínez-Solano 2006
), in the provinces of León and Zamora, and in the Montes de Toledo in Toledo and Ciudad Real. Southwards the species reaches the northern parts of Jaén and

<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes hespericus</tp:taxon-name>
is a generalist that tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions and diverse substrates. However, it seems to avoid siliceous and some 
types
of acid soils (Sánchez-Herráiz 2004). It can be found in semi-arid steppes in the Ebro basin and the southeast, as well as in temperate forests of beech and oak, but usually avoids the densest forest formations. It is common in abandoned quarries and cattle ponds and tolerates high levels of salinity. Specimens can reach eight years (males) and 10 years (females) of age (

As in the other western

types
of notes (
A
and

A
note followed by a single 
B
note (

). Reciprocal calls of females have been reported (Sánchez-Herráiz 2004). Calling specimens are found at the edge or within water, with body temperatures between 10 °C –17.5°C (Sánchez-Herráiz 2004;

            <p>Identity.
Described as 
<tp:taxon-name>Rana punctataDaudin, 1802</tp:taxon-name>
, from a locality in 
France
("aux environs de Beauvais", Department Oise, northern 
France
) (
Frost 2015
). One synonym, 
<tp:taxon-name>Rana plicataDaudin, 1802</tp:taxon-name>
, from near Montpellier, 
France
(
Frost 2015
). We could not locate the 
type
specimens in the Paris museum (see also 
Frost 2015
), but a more intensive search of that and other French collections might be warranted to ascertain the fate of the 
types
of these two nomina. However, because the localities of both taxa are deeply in the range of the genetic lineage D, there is no doubt about the identity of this lineage with the name 
<tp:taxon-name>Rana punctata</tp:taxon-name>
, and the status of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rana plicata</tp:taxon-name>
as its junior synonym.
</p>
            <p>Morphology.
A medium sized frog with an average SVL of 
35.5 mm
(maximum SVL 
41.6 mm
) in males and 
38.8 mm
(51.0 mm) in females (
Table 3
). As all congeners its dorsal skin has tubercles and folds forming an irregular pattern of discontinuous dorsolateral folds, with considerable variation among individuals. Ventral side whitish, dorsally with irregular greenish dots and patches which typically are centered on the tubercles and folds, and sometimes extending around these. No webbing between fingers and weakly expressed between toes, except in males (where foot webbing are clearly expressed). Males with distinct nuptial pads on fingers and arms. Further morphometric values are summarized in 
Table 3
, and original measurements in Supplementary Table S2.

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>Distribution.<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
is widely distributed in 
France
, extending into northwestern 
Italy
(
Liguria
and 
Piedmont
) and northeastern 
Spain
(
Catalonia
) (
Le Garff 1989
; 
Salvidio &amp; Bologna 2007
). The northern limits are currently in the French department of 
Nord-Pas-de-Calais
, where its presence is rare and limited (
Duguet &amp; Melki 2003
). Fossil evidence indicates its existence further to the north in the past (Blain 
et al.
2014). In 
Italy
, it is distributed in coastal 
Liguria
(

Salvidio 
et al.
2004

), and in 
Piedmont
(
Boulenger, 1897
) where it has recently been rediscovered (
Andreone &amp; Sindaco 1998
; 

Sindaco 
et al.
2002

). In the Iberian Peninsula, it is restricted to the northeast, including eastern 
Catalonia
(
Martínez-Rica 1983
; 
Barbadillo 2002b
), where it reaches its maximum altitude in the Pyrenees (
2,000 m
; 
Borrás &amp; Polls 1987
; 

Guix 
et al.
2009

). In 
France

Italy

<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
inhabits plains (

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

; 

Salvidio

2004

; 
Pottier 2008
), is absent from most of the French Pyrenees (
Boulenger, 1897
; 
Guyétant &amp; Geniez 2013
) and only exceeds elevations of 
1,000 m
in the Massif Central and in the Alpes Maritimes (
Salvidio &amp; Bologna 2007
). The fossil record suggests an ancient presence of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
at the east of its present distribution (
Blain &amp; Bailón 2003
; 
Delfino 2004
). The current distribution is roughly within the region of subtropical climate with dry summers in the Koppen-Geiger classification (

Peel 
et al.
2007

), and extends into the oceanic temperate region in western 
France
and the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula.

               <tp:material-citation>Natural history.
Numerous studies 

on 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
biology have been performed in 
France
, 
Italy
and 
northeastern Spain
and therefore the respective data can be reliably assigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
.

This encompasses general accounts on the biology of the species (e.g., 
Elzen 1975
, 
1976
), diet analysis of adults from 
Catalonia
(

Bea 
et al.
1994

), and diet preferences of tadpoles (

Richter-Boix 
et al.
2007

). Reproduction is related to an increase in seasonal rainfall and occurs early in the year, usually before that of other anuran species, with two breeding periods: one at mid-fall and another in late winter and spring (
Sindaco &amp; Andreone 1988
; 

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

;

et al.
2005

; 

Richter-Boix

;

), however, in southern populations the breeding season extends all year round (
A. Montori
pers. com.). This reproductive strategy may reduce interspecific competition (

Jakob 
et al.
2003

; 

Richter-Boix 
et al.
2006

) and does not result in an inhibition of gene flow between early and late reproduction groups (

Jourdan-Pineau 
et al.
2012

). Breeding occurs in seasonal water bodies, mainly slow-flowing streams and ephemeral ponds located in cultivated areas, grasslands, shrubs and meadows (although the ponds often are more permanent than those used by 
<tp:taxon-name>P. atlanticus</tp:taxon-name>
                  <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
). The species is frequently found at the entrance of caves and karstic sites (

<tp:taxon-name>P. hespericus</tp:taxon-name>
                  <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
(but unlike 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
, see however 
Reques and Tejedo 2014
). Eggs are black and small (diameter 
1.5–2 mm
), arranged in strings of 
70–80 mm
length and containing 40
</tp:material-citation>
– 
<tp:material-citation>700 eggs
. Overall clutch size can be up to 1,600 eggs (
Boulenger, 1897
; 
Lanza 1983
; 

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

). Hatching success might be related to water oxygen content (

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

). The incubation period is 8–9 days at 14–20°C (
Nöllert &amp; Nöllert 1992
). Larvae reach metamorphosis in roughly two months but this period can be delayed to up to four months (
Sindaco &amp; Andreone 1988
; 

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

), and up to eight months in hibernating larvae (
Lataste, 1876
). Phenotypic plasticity in morphology and larval development has been documented (
Johansson and Richter-Boix 2013
). Males reach sexual maturity at one year of age and females at two years and longevity can reach 8 years (in males) and 10 years (in females), similarly to other species of the genus (

Esteban 
et al.
2004

, 

Erişmiş 
et al.
2011

). The sex ratio within a population is close to 1:1 (

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

). The 
IUCN
threat status of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
is 
Least Concern
(
Denoëlet al.
2009

); however, in the edge of its range (north of 
France
, 
Italy
and east of 
Spain
), the species is generally scarce and highly threatened, due to the loss of breeding sites, close to local extinction in some areas (

            <p>Advertisement call and reproductive behavior.
The advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
has been described by several authors (
Hotz 1971
; 
Elzen 1975
; Paillete 
et al.
1992). Several call parameters (e.g., call duration) were found to depend on the temperature (
Boulenger, 1897
; Paillete 
et al.
1992). As with all western 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
, the call consists of two notes (
A
and 
B
) and has been reported as typically containing only a single 
B
note following 
A
(

Paillette 
et al.
1992

). Our analysis shows that also sequences of several 
B
notes can be emitted following an 
A
(

), and it remains to be assessed by a more detailed study whether populational variation exists in the frequency of 
B
series. Males call from positions partially or even completely submerged in the water, and occasional episodes of mortality due to sudden drops in temperature have been observed (

Montori 
et al.
2011

).
</p>
            <p>
Males remain for a longer period of time than females at the breeding sites and show a marked philopatry (

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

). Female release calls have been mentioned by 
Elzen (1976)
. The amplexus is inguinal and usually lasts a few hours (

. The examined tadpole has an elliptical body, a narrowly rounded snout in dorsal view, protruding eyes from the surface of the body and a very short tail with a typical braided line pattern; and spiraculum sinistral. The distance between eyes is moderately wide and nares are very large, round, positioned high dorsally, and situated nearer to snout than to eye and below the eye level. Moderately wide oral disk (

), emarginated, upper labium is wider than lower labium, LTRF is 5(2–5)/5(1–3). The upper jaw sheath is partially keratinized with pointed serrations, moderately wide without medial convexity. The lower sheath is wide V-shaped, partially keratinized and partially hidden by the upper one. Both jaw sheaths have a smooth surface. This tadpole is characterized by the presence of a network of dark lines, as it is also typical for larvae of the anuran genera 
<tp:taxon-name>Bombina</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Discoglossus</tp:taxon-name>
, covering the whole body, in addition to the presence of sparse dark spots. The venter is transparent with irregularly spiral shape intestinal coils.

<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
reproduces in ephemeral water bodies, mainly temporary streams and seasonal ponds located around agricultural crops, grassland, scrub and oak from 
Mediterranean
savanna. 
It
tolerates some salinity, even at the larval stage, reproducing sometimes in salty coastal wetlands and inland brackish water lagoons (
Reques
&amp; 
Tejedo
2014

). 
It
tolerates a variety of substrates (siliceous, clay and calcareous). 
Phenological
changes occur in dry years (
Díaz-Paniagua
1989

; 
Sánchez-Herráiz
2004). 
Breeding
starts early in the season, avoiding interspecific competition (

Díaz 
Paniagua
1988), often during autumn rains (
October
– 
November
) in southern 
Portugal
and 
Western Andalusia
(

&amp; 
Rivas
1987

; 
González de la Vega

March
at higher latitudes (
Badajoz

) and altitudes (
Sierra de Cabra
: 
Reques
&amp; 
Tejedo
1991

; 
Sierra Morena

2000

). 
Sexual
maturity is reached at an age of one year (
Sánchez-Herráiz
2004) and the maximum age is around six years (
Reques
2014). 
The
species is threatened by fragmentation and destruction of breeding habitat (

van de 
Vlietet al.

Salvador
&amp; 
García-París
2001

lineages, consisting of two notes (
A

B
note (Paillete 
et al.
1992; 
Pargana 1998
; Sanchez-Herráiz 2004). Calling specimens are in or near the water, but they do not emit their vocalizations fully submerged. Reproductive activity takes place before and after sunset, mostly during rainy days accompanied by slight increases of environmental temperature, although they can also exhibit diurnal activity on rainy days (

Adult male in excellent state of preservation. Some tissue removed ventrally from right thigh for molecular analysis. Measurements: SVL, 33.0; HW, 11.6; HL, 11.0; TD, 1.9; ED, 3.6; END, 2.7; NSD, 2.6; NND, 2.3; 
HAL
, 9.0; 
FORL
, 20.0; HIL, 52.6; FOL, 16.6; 
FOTL
, 25.4; TIL, 16.5. Body relatively slender; head dorsally flattened, slightly wider than longer, wider than body; snout slightly pointed in dorsal view, rounded and flattened in lateral view; nostrils directed dorsolaterally, slightly protuberant, nearer to tip of snout than to eye; canthus rostralis indistinct, straight; loreal region very slightly concave, almost flat; eye moderately large, notably protuberant dorsally; interocular distance slightly larger than horizontal eye diameter, larger than internarial and eye-nostril distance; pupil vertical; tympanum externally visible, distinct, oval, wider vertically than horizontally, its horizontal diameter being 68% of vertical eye diameter, positioned near corner of mouth; supratympanic fold distinct in its anterodorsal part running from posterior corner of eye to level of forelimb insertion; tongue free posteriorly, of truncated shape, vomerine teeth distinct, in two patches between and at the same level as choanae; choanae moderately sized, ovoid. Premaxillary and maxillary teeth present. Arms slender, webbing almost absent, very small rudiments recognizable; comparative finger length I&lt;II&lt;IV&lt;III, fingers with dermal fringes. No enlarged finger disks. One large, conical subarticular tubercle present proximally on each finger; three flattened metacarpal tubercles; inner and outer metacarpal tubercles of different size (outer slightly larger than inner) and distinctly larger than central tubercle. Black nuptial pads on inner sides of first and second fingers, as one elongate patch on forearm, a second slightly bigger elongate patch on arm, and a small agglomeration on both sides of chest near axilla. Hindlimbs slender; tibiotarsal articulation reaches between eye and nostril when adpressed along body; inner metatarsal tubercle distinct but relatively small, outer metatarsal tubercle absent; proximal subarticular tubercles indistinct, remaining subarticular tubercles absent. Comparative toe length I&lt;II&lt;V&lt;III&lt;IV; third toe distinctly longer than fifth toe; toes with conspicuous dermal fringes to tip. Webbing between toes weakly expressed but clearly present and more than merely an extension of dermal fringes. Webbing formula difficult to determine due to absence of subarticular tubercles and presence of dermal fringes. Skin on the dorsal surface granular, with distinct warts; skin of throat, chest, and venter smooth except granular on posterior most part of belly; ventral surfaces of thighs and arms granular. Especially those warts that coincide with dark greenish spots on dorsum of slightly elongated shape and arranged in longitudinal rows. The anterodorsal part of supratympanic fold is continued into the inguinal region as a distinct row of small tubercles and ridges.

Colour of the 
holotype
: The skin colour is between dark gray to olive brown with drab green bands on the back and legs. The back is dotted with small round or oval prominences of olive colors. The ventral area, which is smooth or slightly rough, has a light colour from pale green to gray tones. Nuptial pads are grass green. Colour in life (

) is more clear with light greenish spots on the back and a design of a drab olive line from the eye to the insertion of anterior legs.

            <p>Natural history.
Poorly known. Reproductive phenology is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
and takes place early in the season, starting with the first rains at mid-autumn and extending into the winter. More detailed fieldwork is needed to determine the conservation status of populations in some regions (van de 

Vliet 
et al.
2012

; 

Nunes 
et al.
2014

). Given that suitable breeding habitats (i.e., temporary ponds in traditional Mediterranean farmland) are disappearing at an alarming rate in 
Portugal
(
Beja
&amp; Alcazar 2003

) affecting overall Mediterranean biodiversity (

Stoate 
et al.
2009

), it is urgent to assess the conservation status of this species and possibly implement conservation measures. In the Natural Reserve of Paul do Boquilobo (central 
Portugal
), the introduction of the American crayfish (
<tp:taxon-name>Procambarus clarkii</tp:taxon-name>
) resulted in the extinction of local populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. atlanticus</tp:taxon-name>
eight years later (

Description of the 
holotype
.

Adult male in excellent state of preservation. Some tissue removed ventrally from right thigh for molecular analysis. Measurements: SVL, 36.6; HW, 12.7; HL, 13.3; TD, 2.7; ED, 4.0; END, 4.3; NSD, 3.0; NND, 3.6; 
HAL
, 10.6; 
FORL
, 23.2; HIL, 61.6; FOL, 18.4; 
FOTL
, 28.5; TIL, 18.4. Body relatively slender; head dorsally flattened, slightly longer than wide, wider than body; snout slightly pointed in dorsal view, rounded in lateral view; nostrils directed dorsolaterally, not protuberant, nearer to tip of snout than to eye; canthus rostralis indistinct, straight; loreal region very slightly concave, almost flat; eye moderately large, notably protuberant dorsally; interocular distance slightly smaller than horizontal eye diameter, larger than internarial and slightly smaller than eye-nostril distance; pupil vertical; tympanum externally visible, distinct, oval, wider vertically than horizontally, its horizontal diameter is 68% of maximum eye diameter, positioned near corner of mouth; supratympanic fold moderately distinct in its anterodorsal part running from posterior corner of eye to posterior corner of tympanum, indistinct in its posteroventral part running from posterior corner of tympanum to insertion of forelimb; tongue free posteriorly, of truncate shape, vomerine teeth distinct, in two patches between and at the same level as choanae; choanae moderately sized, ovoid. Premaxillary and maxillary teeth present. Arms slender, webbing almost absent, very small rudiments recognizable; comparative finger length I&lt;II&lt;IV&lt;III, fingers with dermal fringes (poorly recognizable on small fingers due to fixation). No enlarged finger disks. One large, rounded subarticular tubercle present proximally on each finger; three flattened metacarpal tubercles; inner and outer metacarpal tubercles of similar size and distinctly larger than central tubercle. Black nuptial pads on inner sides of first and second fingers, as one elongate patch on forearm, a second slightly smaller elongate patch on arm, and a small agglomeration on both sides of chest near axilla. Hindlimbs slender; tibiotarsal articulation reaches between eye and nostril when adpressed along body; inner metatarsal tubercle distinct but relatively small, outer metatarsal tubercle absent; proximal subarticular tubercles indistinct, remaining subarticular tubercles absent. Comparative toe length I&lt;II&lt;V&lt;III&lt;IV; third toe distinctly longer than fifth toe; toes with conspicuous dermal fringes to tip. Webbing between toes weakly expressed but clearly present and more than merely an extension of dermal fringes. Webbing formula difficult to determine due to absence of subarticular tubercles and presence of dermal fringes, but webbing almost complete between toes I and II, between second and third phalangeal joint of toe II between toes II and III. Skin on the dorsal surface granular, with distinct warts; skin of throat, chest, and venter smooth except granular on posteriormost part of belly; ventral surfaces of thighs and arms granular. Especially those warts that coincide with dark greeninsh spots on dorsum of slightly elongated shape and arranged in longitudinal rows. The anterodorsal part of the supratympanic fold is continued into the inguinal region as a distinct row of small tubercles and ridges, partly marked by greenish dots.

            <p>
Colour of the 
holotype
. The skin colour is between dark green to olive drab with light olive bands on the back and legs. The back is dotted with a pattern of small oval and linear prominences of olive green. On the lateral side, a clear band is more or less visible, from the tympanum to the insertion of posterior limbs. The ventral area, which is smooth or slightly rough, has a light colour from pale green to yellow tones. Colour in life is similar, with light greenish spots on the back, instead of drab colors, and a design of two crossed bands clear without dots (

).

Spain
. Its range extends mainly in areas of low and mid-altitude mountains, from the sea level to 
1,900 m
in 
La Rioja
(
Zaldívar 2004
), almost 
2,000 m
in Sierra Seca (
Granada
) and maybe higher at the locality of Castril, 
Granada
(

Fernández-Cardenete 
et al.
2000

), but additional confirmation is required. It occupies most of the eastern and central parts of 
Spain
(Lacomba &amp; Sancho 1999; 
Barbadillo 2002b
). The western range limits are in the southeast of 
Madrid
(
Martínez-Solano &amp; García-París 2001
; 
Martínez-Solano 2006
), in the provinces of León and Zamora, and in the Montes de Toledo in Toledo and Ciudad Real. Southwards the species reaches the northern parts of Jaén and 
Granada
provinces (
Barbadillo 2002b
; 

Ceacero

2007

) and coastal parts of Almería (González-

<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes hespericus</tp:taxon-name>
is a generalist that tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions and diverse substrates. However, it seems to avoid siliceous and some 
types
of acid soils (Sánchez-Herráiz 2004). It can be found in semi-arid steppes in the Ebro basin and the southeast, as well as in temperate forests of beech and oak, but usually avoids the densest forest formations. It is common in abandoned quarries and cattle ponds and tolerates high levels of salinity. Specimens can reach eight years (males) and 10 years (females) of age (

Esteban 
et al.
2004

; Sánchez-Herráiz 2004).

As in the other western 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
lineages, the call consists of two 
types
of notes (
A
and 
B
), nonetheless emitted just once time. In the recordings previously studied by Sánchez-Herráiz (2004) analyzed by us, and in numerous other individuals heard in the field, one call typically consists of one 
A
note followed by a single 
B
note (

). Reciprocal calls of females have been reported (Sánchez-Herráiz 2004). Calling specimens are found at the edge or within water, with body temperatures between 10 °C –17.5°C (Sánchez-Herráiz 2004; 

Esteban 
et al.
2002

). Call intensity and spectral frequency were not found to be related to the size or age of the male (

            <p>Identity.
Described as 
<tp:taxon-name>Rana punctataDaudin, 1802</tp:taxon-name>
, from a locality in 
France
("aux environs de Beauvais", Department Oise, northern 
France
) (
Frost 2015
). One synonym, 
<tp:taxon-name>Rana plicataDaudin, 1802</tp:taxon-name>
, from near Montpellier, 
France
(
Frost 2015
). We could not locate the 
type
specimens in the Paris museum (see also 
Frost 2015
), but a more intensive search of that and other French collections might be warranted to ascertain the fate of the 
types
of these two nomina. However, because the localities of both taxa are deeply in the range of the genetic lineage D, there is no doubt about the identity of this lineage with the name 
<tp:taxon-name>Rana punctata</tp:taxon-name>
, and the status of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rana plicata</tp:taxon-name>
as its junior synonym.
</p>
            <p>Morphology.
A medium sized frog with an average SVL of 
35.5 mm
(maximum SVL 
41.6 mm
) in males and 
38.8 mm
(51.0 mm) in females (
Table 3
). As all congeners its dorsal skin has tubercles and folds forming an irregular pattern of discontinuous dorsolateral folds, with considerable variation among individuals. Ventral side whitish, dorsally with irregular greenish dots and patches which typically are centered on the tubercles and folds, and sometimes extending around these. No webbing between fingers and weakly expressed between toes, except in males (where foot webbing are clearly expressed). Males with distinct nuptial pads on fingers and arms. Further morphometric values are summarized in 
Table 3
, and original measurements in Supplementary Table S2.

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>Distribution.<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
is widely distributed in 
France
, extending into northwestern 
Italy
(
Liguria
and 
Piedmont
) and northeastern 
Spain
(
Catalonia
) (
Le Garff 1989
; 
Salvidio &amp; Bologna 2007
). The northern limits are currently in the French department of 
Nord-Pas-de-Calais
, where its presence is rare and limited (
Duguet &amp; Melki 2003
). Fossil evidence indicates its existence further to the north in the past (Blain 
et al.
2014). In 
Italy
, it is distributed in coastal 
Liguria
(

Salvidio 
et al.
2004

), and in 
Piedmont
(
Boulenger, 1897
) where it has recently been rediscovered (
Andreone &amp; Sindaco 1998
; 

Sindaco 
et al.
2002

). In the Iberian Peninsula, it is restricted to the northeast, including eastern 
Catalonia
(
Martínez-Rica 1983
; 
Barbadillo 2002b
), where it reaches its maximum altitude in the Pyrenees (
2,000 m
; 
Borrás &amp; Polls 1987
; 

Guix 
et al.
2009

). In 
France
and 
Italy
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
inhabits plains (

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

; 

Salvidio 
et al.
2004

; 
Pottier 2008
), is absent from most of the French Pyrenees (
Boulenger, 1897
; 
Guyétant &amp; Geniez 2013
) and only exceeds elevations of 
1,000 m
in the Massif Central and in the Alpes Maritimes (
Salvidio &amp; Bologna 2007
). The fossil record suggests an ancient presence of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
at the east of its present distribution (
Blain &amp; Bailón 2003
; 
Delfino 2004
). The current distribution is roughly within the region of subtropical climate with dry summers in the Koppen-Geiger classification (

Peel 
et al.
2007

), and extends into the oceanic temperate region in western 
France
and the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula.
</p>
            <p>
               <tp:material-citation>Natural history.
Numerous studies 

on 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
biology have been performed in 
France
, 
Italy
and 
northeastern Spain
and therefore the respective data can be reliably assigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
.

This encompasses general accounts on the biology of the species (e.g., 
Elzen 1975
, 
1976
), diet analysis of adults from 
Catalonia
(

Bea 
et al.
1994

), and diet preferences of tadpoles (

Richter-Boix 
et al.
2007

). Reproduction is related to an increase in seasonal rainfall and occurs early in the year, usually before that of other anuran species, with two breeding periods: one at mid-fall and another in late winter and spring (
Sindaco &amp; Andreone 1988
; 

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

; 

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

; 

Boix 
et al.
2004

; 

Egea-Serrano 
et al.
2005

; 

Richter-Boix 
et al.
2006

; 

Petitot 
et al.
2014

). Reproduction in autumn is often minor and irregular (

Cayuela 
et al.
2012

), however, in southern populations the breeding season extends all year round (
A. Montori
pers. com.). This reproductive strategy may reduce interspecific competition (

Jakob 
et al.
2003

; 

Richter-Boix 
et al.
2006

) and does not result in an inhibition of gene flow between early and late reproduction groups (

Jourdan-Pineau 
et al.
2012

). Breeding occurs in seasonal water bodies, mainly slow-flowing streams and ephemeral ponds located in cultivated areas, grasslands, shrubs and meadows (although the ponds often are more permanent than those used by 
<tp:taxon-name>P. atlanticus</tp:taxon-name>
                  <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
). The species is frequently found at the entrance of caves and karstic sites (
Elzen 1976
; 
Olague &amp; Lagares 2000
; Sánchez-Herráiz 2004; 

Blain 
et al.
2008b

; 
Vento &amp; Pérez 2011
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
tolerates high levels of salinity and shows a preference for clayeye soils as 
<tp:taxon-name>P. hespericus</tp:taxon-name>
                  <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
(but unlike 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
, see however 
Reques and Tejedo 2014
). Eggs are black and small (diameter 
1.5–2 mm
), arranged in strings of 
70–80 mm
length and containing 40
</tp:material-citation>
– 
<tp:material-citation>700 eggs
. Overall clutch size can be up to 1,600 eggs (
Boulenger, 1897
; 
Lanza 1983
; 

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

). Hatching success might be related to water oxygen content (

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

). The incubation period is 8–9 days at 14–20°C (
Nöllert &amp; Nöllert 1992
). Larvae reach metamorphosis in roughly two months but this period can be delayed to up to four months (
Sindaco &amp; Andreone 1988
; 

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

), and up to eight months in hibernating larvae (
Lataste, 1876
). Phenotypic plasticity in morphology and larval development has been documented (
Johansson and Richter-Boix 2013
). Males reach sexual maturity at one year of age and females at two years and longevity can reach 8 years (in males) and 10 years (in females), similarly to other species of the genus (

Esteban 
et al.
2004

, 

Erişmiş 
et al.
2011

). The sex ratio within a population is close to 1:1 (

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

). The 
IUCN
threat status of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
is 
Least Concern
(
Denoëlet al.
2009

); however, in the edge of its range (north of 
France
, 
Italy
and east of 
Spain
), the species is generally scarce and highly threatened, due to the loss of breeding sites, close to local extinction in some areas (
Parent
1989

; 
Salvidioet al.
2004

; 
Escoriza
2015

).

B
notes can be emitted following an 
A
(

), and it remains to be assessed by a more detailed study whether populational variation exists in the frequency of 
B
series. Males call from positions partially or even completely submerged in the water, and occasional episodes of mortality due to sudden drops in temperature have been observed (

Montori

Males remain for a longer period of time than females at the breeding sites and show a marked philopatry (

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

). Female release calls have been mentioned by 
Elzen (1976)
. The amplexus is inguinal and usually lasts a few hours (
Guyétant 1986

. The examined tadpole has an elliptical body, a narrowly rounded snout in dorsal view, protruding eyes from the surface of the body and a very short tail with a typical braided line pattern; and spiraculum sinistral. The distance between eyes is moderately wide and nares are very large, round, positioned high dorsally, and situated nearer to snout than to eye and below the eye level. Moderately wide oral disk (

), emarginated, upper labium is wider than lower labium, LTRF is 5(2–5)/5(1–3). The upper jaw sheath is partially keratinized with pointed serrations, moderately wide without medial convexity. The lower sheath is wide V-shaped, partially keratinized and partially hidden by the upper one. Both jaw sheaths have a smooth surface. This tadpole is characterized by the presence of a network of dark lines, as it is also typical for larvae of the anuran genera 
<tp:taxon-name>Bombina</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Discoglossus</tp:taxon-name>
, covering the whole body, in addition to the presence of sparse dark spots. The venter is transparent with irregularly spiral shape intestinal coils.

<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
reproduces in ephemeral water bodies, mainly temporary streams and seasonal ponds located around agricultural crops, grassland, scrub and oak from 
Mediterranean
savanna. 
It
tolerates some salinity, even at the larval stage, reproducing sometimes in salty coastal wetlands and inland brackish water lagoons (
Reques
&amp; 
Tejedo
2014

). 
It
tolerates a variety of substrates (siliceous, clay and calcareous). 
Phenological
changes occur in dry years (
Díaz-Paniagua
1989

; 
Sánchez-Herráiz
2004). 
Breeding
starts early in the season, avoiding interspecific competition (

Díaz 
Paniagua
1988), often during autumn rains (
October
– 
November
) in southern 
Portugal
and 
Western Andalusia
(

). 
Sexual
maturity is reached at an age of one year (
Sánchez-Herráiz

Reques
2014). 
The
species is threatened by fragmentation and destruction of breeding habitat (

van de 
Vlietet al.

Salvador
&amp; 
García-París

FORL
, 20.0; HIL, 52.6; FOL, 16.6; 
FOTL
, 25.4; TIL, 16.5. Body relatively slender; head dorsally flattened, slightly wider than longer, wider than body; snout slightly pointed in dorsal view, rounded and flattened in lateral view; nostrils directed dorsolaterally, slightly protuberant, nearer to tip of snout than to eye; canthus rostralis indistinct, straight; loreal region very slightly concave, almost flat; eye moderately large, notably protuberant dorsally; interocular distance slightly larger than horizontal eye diameter, larger than internarial and eye-nostril distance; pupil vertical; tympanum externally visible, distinct, oval, wider vertically than horizontally, its horizontal diameter being 68% of vertical eye diameter, positioned near corner of mouth; supratympanic fold distinct in its anterodorsal part running from posterior corner of eye to level of forelimb insertion; tongue free posteriorly, of truncated shape, vomerine teeth distinct, in two patches between and at the same level as choanae; choanae moderately sized, ovoid. Premaxillary and maxillary teeth present. Arms slender, webbing almost absent, very small rudiments recognizable; comparative finger length I&lt;II&lt;IV&lt;III, fingers with dermal fringes. No enlarged finger disks. One large, conical subarticular tubercle present proximally on each finger; three flattened metacarpal tubercles; inner and outer metacarpal tubercles of different size (outer slightly larger than inner) and distinctly larger than central tubercle. Black nuptial pads on inner sides of first and second fingers, as one elongate patch on forearm, a second slightly bigger elongate patch on arm, and a small agglomeration on both sides of chest near axilla. Hindlimbs slender; tibiotarsal articulation reaches between eye and nostril when adpressed along body; inner metatarsal tubercle distinct but relatively small, outer metatarsal tubercle absent; proximal subarticular tubercles indistinct, remaining subarticular tubercles absent. Comparative toe length I&lt;II&lt;V&lt;III&lt;IV; third toe distinctly longer than fifth toe; toes with conspicuous dermal fringes to tip. Webbing between toes weakly expressed but clearly present and more than merely an extension of dermal fringes. Webbing formula difficult to determine due to absence of subarticular tubercles and presence of dermal fringes. Skin on the dorsal surface granular, with distinct warts; skin of throat, chest, and venter smooth except granular on posterior most part of belly; ventral surfaces of thighs and arms granular. Especially those warts that coincide with dark greenish spots on dorsum of slightly elongated shape and arranged in longitudinal rows. The anterodorsal part of supratympanic fold is continued into the inguinal region as a distinct row of small tubercles and ridges.

Colour of the 
holotype
: The skin colour is between dark gray to olive brown with drab green bands on the back and legs. The back is dotted with small round or oval prominences of olive colors. The ventral area, which is smooth or slightly rough, has a light colour from pale green to gray tones. Nuptial pads are grass green. Colour in life (

) is more clear with light greenish spots on the back and a design of a drab olive line from the eye to the insertion of anterior legs.

Poorly known. Reproductive phenology is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>

Vliet 
et al.
2012

; 

Nunes 
et al.
2014

). Given that suitable breeding habitats (i.e., temporary ponds in traditional Mediterranean farmland) are disappearing at an alarming rate in 
Portugal
(
Beja
&amp; Alcazar 2003

) affecting overall Mediterranean biodiversity (

Stoate 
et al.
2009

), it is urgent to assess the conservation status of this species and possibly implement conservation measures. In the Natural Reserve of Paul do Boquilobo (central 
Portugal
), the introduction of the American crayfish (
<tp:taxon-name>Procambarus clarkii</tp:taxon-name>
) resulted in the extinction of local populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. atlanticus</tp:taxon-name>
eight years later (

Description of the 
holotype
.

Adult male in excellent state of preservation. Some tissue removed ventrally from right thigh for molecular analysis. Measurements: SVL, 36.6; HW, 12.7; HL, 13.3; TD, 2.7; ED, 4.0; END, 4.3; NSD, 3.0; NND, 3.6; 
HAL
, 10.6; 
FORL
, 23.2; HIL, 61.6; FOL, 18.4; 
FOTL
, 28.5; TIL, 18.4. Body relatively slender; head dorsally flattened, slightly longer than wide, wider than body; snout slightly pointed in dorsal view, rounded in lateral view; nostrils directed dorsolaterally, not protuberant, nearer to tip of snout than to eye; canthus rostralis indistinct, straight; loreal region very slightly concave, almost flat; eye moderately large, notably protuberant dorsally; interocular distance slightly smaller than horizontal eye diameter, larger than internarial and slightly smaller than eye-nostril distance; pupil vertical; tympanum externally visible, distinct, oval, wider vertically than horizontally, its horizontal diameter is 68% of maximum eye diameter, positioned near corner of mouth; supratympanic fold moderately distinct in its anterodorsal part running from posterior corner of eye to posterior corner of tympanum, indistinct in its posteroventral part running from posterior corner of tympanum to insertion of forelimb; tongue free posteriorly, of truncate shape, vomerine teeth distinct, in two patches between and at the same level as choanae; choanae moderately sized, ovoid. Premaxillary and maxillary teeth present. Arms slender, webbing almost absent, very small rudiments recognizable; comparative finger length I&lt;II&lt;IV&lt;III, fingers with dermal fringes (poorly recognizable on small fingers due to fixation). No enlarged finger disks. One large, rounded subarticular tubercle present proximally on each finger; three flattened metacarpal tubercles; inner and outer metacarpal tubercles of similar size and distinctly larger than central tubercle. Black nuptial pads on inner sides of first and second fingers, as one elongate patch on forearm, a second slightly smaller elongate patch on arm, and a small agglomeration on both sides of chest near axilla. Hindlimbs slender; tibiotarsal articulation reaches between eye and nostril when adpressed along body; inner metatarsal tubercle distinct but relatively small, outer metatarsal tubercle absent; proximal subarticular tubercles indistinct, remaining subarticular tubercles absent. Comparative toe length I&lt;II&lt;V&lt;III&lt;IV; third toe distinctly longer than fifth toe; toes with conspicuous dermal fringes to tip. Webbing between toes weakly expressed but clearly present and more than merely an extension of dermal fringes. Webbing formula difficult to determine due to absence of subarticular tubercles and presence of dermal fringes, but webbing almost complete between toes I and II, between second and third phalangeal joint of toe II between toes II and III. Skin on the dorsal surface granular, with distinct warts; skin of throat, chest, and venter smooth except granular on posteriormost part of belly; ventral surfaces of thighs and arms granular. Especially those warts that coincide with dark greeninsh spots on dorsum of slightly elongated shape and arranged in longitudinal rows. The anterodorsal part of the supratympanic fold is continued into the inguinal region as a distinct row of small tubercles and ridges, partly marked by greenish dots.
</p>
            <p>
Colour of the 
holotype
. The skin colour is between dark green to olive drab with light olive bands on the back and legs. The back is dotted with a pattern of small oval and linear prominences of olive green. On the lateral side, a clear band is more or less visible, from the tympanum to the insertion of posterior limbs. The ventral area, which is smooth or slightly rough, has a light colour from pale green to yellow tones. Colour in life is similar, with light greenish spots on the back, instead of drab colors, and a design of two crossed bands clear without dots (

).
</p>
            <p>Variation.
In the paratypes EBD 34506 and EBD 34507, the foot webbing is much less distinctly expressed.

is distributed in the Iberian Peninsula and as far as known, restricted to 
Spain
. Its range extends mainly in areas of low and mid-altitude mountains, from the sea level to 
1,900 m
in 
La Rioja
(
Zaldívar 2004
), almost 
2,000 m
in Sierra Seca (
Granada
) and maybe higher at the locality of Castril, 
Granada
(

Fernández-Cardenete 
et al.
2000

), but additional confirmation is required. It occupies most of the eastern and central parts of 
Spain
(Lacomba &amp; Sancho 1999; 
Barbadillo 2002b
). The western range limits are in the southeast of 
Madrid
(
Martínez-Solano &amp; García-París 2001
; 
Martínez-Solano 2006
), in the provinces of León and Zamora, and in the Montes de Toledo in Toledo and Ciudad Real. Southwards the species reaches the northern parts of Jaén and 
Granada
provinces (
Barbadillo 2002b
; 

Ceacero 
et al.
2007

) and coastal parts of Almería (González- 

Miras &amp;

provided notes on the natural history of this species. 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes hespericus</tp:taxon-name>
is a generalist that tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions and diverse substrates. However, it seems to avoid siliceous and some 
types
of acid soils (Sánchez-Herráiz 2004). It can be found in semi-arid steppes in the Ebro basin and the southeast, as well as in temperate forests of beech and oak, but usually avoids the densest forest formations. It is common in abandoned quarries and cattle ponds and tolerates high levels of salinity. Specimens can reach eight years (males) and 10 years (females) of age (

Esteban 
et al.
2004

; Sánchez-Herráiz 2004).

            <p>Advertisement call and reproductive behavior.
As in the other western 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
lineages, the call consists of two 
types
of notes (
A
and 
B
), nonetheless emitted just once time. In the recordings previously studied by Sánchez-Herráiz (2004) analyzed by us, and in numerous other individuals heard in the field, one call typically consists of one 
A
note followed by a single 
B
note (

). Reciprocal calls of females have been reported (Sánchez-Herráiz 2004). Calling specimens are found at the edge or within water, with body temperatures between 10 °C –17.5°C (Sánchez-Herráiz 2004; 

Esteban 
et al.
2002

). Call intensity and spectral frequency were not found to be related to the size or age of the male (

Esteban 
et al.
2002

).

            <p>Morphology.
A medium sized frog with an average SVL of 
35.5 mm
(maximum SVL 
41.6 mm
) in males and 
38.8 mm
(51.0 mm) in females (
Table 3
). As all congeners its dorsal skin has tubercles and folds forming an irregular pattern of discontinuous dorsolateral folds, with considerable variation among individuals. Ventral side whitish, dorsally with irregular greenish dots and patches which typically are centered on the tubercles and folds, and sometimes extending around these. No webbing between fingers and weakly expressed between toes, except in males (where foot webbing are clearly expressed). Males with distinct nuptial pads on fingers and arms. Further morphometric values are summarized in 
Table 3
, and original measurements in Supplementary Table S2.

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="distribution">
            <p>Distribution.<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
is widely distributed in 
France
, extending into northwestern 
Italy
(
Liguria
and 
Piedmont
) and northeastern 
Spain
(
Catalonia
) (
Le Garff 1989
; 
Salvidio &amp; Bologna 2007
). The northern limits are currently in the French department of 
Nord-Pas-de-Calais
, where its presence is rare and limited (
Duguet &amp; Melki 2003
). Fossil evidence indicates its existence further to the north in the past (Blain 
et al.
2014). In 
Italy
, it is distributed in coastal 
Liguria
(

Salvidio 
et al.
2004

), and in 
Piedmont
(
Boulenger, 1897
) where it has recently been rediscovered (
Andreone &amp; Sindaco 1998
; 

Sindaco 
et al.
2002

). In the Iberian Peninsula, it is restricted to the northeast, including eastern 
Catalonia
(
Martínez-Rica 1983
; 
Barbadillo 2002b
), where it reaches its maximum altitude in the Pyrenees (
2,000 m
; 
Borrás &amp; Polls 1987
; 

Guix 
et al.
2009

). In 
France
and 
Italy
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
inhabits plains (

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

; 

Salvidio 
et al.
2004

; 
Pottier 2008
), is absent from most of the French Pyrenees (
Boulenger, 1897
; 
Guyétant &amp; Geniez 2013
) and only exceeds elevations of 
1,000 m
in the Massif Central and in the Alpes Maritimes (
Salvidio &amp; Bologna 2007
). The fossil record suggests an ancient presence of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
at the east of its present distribution (
Blain &amp; Bailón 2003
; 
Delfino 2004
). The current distribution is roughly within the region of subtropical climate with dry summers in the Koppen-Geiger classification (

Peel 
et al.
2007

), and extends into the oceanic temperate region in western 
France
and the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula.

               <tp:material-citation>Natural history.
Numerous studies 

on 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
biology have been performed in 
France
, 
Italy
and 
northeastern Spain
and therefore the respective data can be reliably assigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
.

This encompasses general accounts on the biology of the species (e.g., 
Elzen 1975
, 
1976
), diet analysis of adults from 
Catalonia
(

Bea 
et al.
1994

), and diet preferences of tadpoles (

Richter-Boix 
et al.
2007

). Reproduction is related to an increase in seasonal rainfall and occurs early in the year, usually before that of other anuran species, with two breeding periods: one at mid-fall and another in late winter and spring (
Sindaco &amp; Andreone 1988
; 

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

; 

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

; 

Boix 
et al.
2004

; 

Egea-Serrano 
et al.
2005

; 

Richter-Boix 
et al.
2006

; 

Petitot 
et al.
2014

). Reproduction in autumn is often minor and irregular (

Cayuela 
et al.
2012

), however, in southern populations the breeding season extends all year round (
A. Montori
pers. com.). This reproductive strategy may reduce interspecific competition (

Jakob 
et al.
2003

; 

Richter-Boix 
et al.
2006

) and does not result in an inhibition of gene flow between early and late reproduction groups (

Jourdan-Pineau 
et al.
2012

). Breeding occurs in seasonal water bodies, mainly slow-flowing streams and ephemeral ponds located in cultivated areas, grasslands, shrubs and meadows (although the ponds often are more permanent than those used by 
<tp:taxon-name>P. atlanticus</tp:taxon-name>
                  <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
). The species is frequently found at the entrance of caves and karstic sites (
Elzen 1976
; 
Olague &amp; Lagares 2000
; Sánchez-Herráiz 2004; 

Blain 
et al.
2008b

; 
Vento &amp; Pérez 2011
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
tolerates high levels of salinity and shows a preference for clayeye soils as 
<tp:taxon-name>P. hespericus</tp:taxon-name>
                  <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
(but unlike 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
, see however 
Reques and Tejedo 2014
). Eggs are black and small (diameter 
1.5–2 mm
), arranged in strings of 
70–80 mm
length and containing 40
</tp:material-citation>
– 
<tp:material-citation>700 eggs
. Overall clutch size can be up to 1,600 eggs (
Boulenger, 1897
; 
Lanza 1983
; 

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

). Hatching success might be related to water oxygen content (

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

). The incubation period is 8–9 days at 14–20°C (
Nöllert &amp; Nöllert 1992
). Larvae reach metamorphosis in roughly two months but this period can be delayed to up to four months (
Sindaco &amp; Andreone 1988
; 

Guyétant 
et al.
1999

), and up to eight months in hibernating larvae (
Lataste, 1876
). Phenotypic plasticity in morphology and larval development has been documented (
Johansson and Richter-Boix 2013
). Males reach sexual maturity at one year of age and females at two years and longevity can reach 8 years (in males) and 10 years (in females), similarly to other species of the genus (

Esteban 
et al.
2004

, 

Erişmiş 
et al.
2011

). The sex ratio within a population is close to 1:1 (

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

). The 
IUCN
threat status of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
is 
Least Concern
(
Denoëlet al.
2009

); however, in the edge of its range (north of 
France
, 
Italy
and east of 
Spain
), the species is generally scarce and highly threatened, due to the loss of breeding sites, close to local extinction in some areas (

2004

; 
Escoriza
2015

            <p>Advertisement call and reproductive behavior.
The advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
has been described by several authors (
Hotz 1971
; 
Elzen 1975
; Paillete 
et al.
1992). Several call parameters (e.g., call duration) were found to depend on the temperature (
Boulenger, 1897
; Paillete 
et al.
1992). As with all western 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
, the call consists of two notes (
A
and 
B
) and has been reported as typically containing only a single 
B
note following 
A
(

Paillette 
et al.
1992

). Our analysis shows that also sequences of several 
B
notes can be emitted following an 
A
(

), and it remains to be assessed by a more detailed study whether populational variation exists in the frequency of 
B
series. Males call from positions partially or even completely submerged in the water, and occasional episodes of mortality due to sudden drops in temperature have been observed (

Montori 
et al.
2011

).
</p>
            <p>
Males remain for a longer period of time than females at the breeding sites and show a marked philopatry (

Toxopeus 
et al.
1993

). Female release calls have been mentioned by 
Elzen (1976)
. The amplexus is inguinal and usually lasts a few hours (
Guyétant 1986
).

. The examined tadpole has an elliptical body, a narrowly rounded snout in dorsal view, protruding eyes from the surface of the body and a very short tail with a typical braided line pattern; and spiraculum sinistral. The distance between eyes is moderately wide and nares are very large, round, positioned high dorsally, and situated nearer to snout than to eye and below the eye level. Moderately wide oral disk (

), emarginated, upper labium is wider than lower labium, LTRF is 5(2–5)/5(1–3). The upper jaw sheath is partially keratinized with pointed serrations, moderately wide without medial convexity. The lower sheath is wide V-shaped, partially keratinized and partially hidden by the upper one. Both jaw sheaths have a smooth surface. This tadpole is characterized by the presence of a network of dark lines, as it is also typical for larvae of the anuran genera 
<tp:taxon-name>Bombina</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Discoglossus</tp:taxon-name>
, covering the whole body, in addition to the presence of sparse dark spots. The venter is transparent with irregularly spiral shape intestinal coils.

<tp:taxon-name>P. atlanticus</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, but most specimens have shorter limbs (

) and an overall more compact body. Numerous differences in osteology have been detected by 

Sánchez-Herráiz 
et al.
(2000)

and 

Sanchiz 
et al.
(2002)

, especially in the cranium, including a less elongated 
tectum nasi
, larger scapular 
crista anterior
, shorter parahyoid bone, and frontoparietals medially more widely separated in 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
than in 
<tp:taxon-name>P. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
. The proximal subarticular tubercles of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
have been described as irregular and protruding conically, whereas in 
<tp:taxon-name>P. hespericus</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
they are often more rounded (Sánchez- Herráiz 
et al.
2000) but the variation of this character requires more careful study. Quite often 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
has dorsally two crossed pale bands forming an X-shaped pattern.

<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
reproduces in ephemeral water bodies, mainly temporary streams and seasonal ponds located around agricultural crops, grassland, scrub and oak from 
Mediterranean
savanna. 
It
tolerates some salinity, even at the larval stage, reproducing sometimes in salty coastal wetlands and inland brackish water lagoons (
Reques
&amp; 
Tejedo
2014

). 
It
tolerates a variety of substrates (siliceous, clay and calcareous). 
Phenological
changes occur in dry years (
Díaz-Paniagua
1989

; 
Sánchez-Herráiz
2004). 
Breeding
starts early in the season, avoiding interspecific competition (

Díaz 
Paniagua
1988), often during autumn rains (
October
– 
November
) in southern 
Portugal
and 
Western Andalusia
(
Busack
&amp;

1982

;

&amp; 
Rivas
1987

; 
González de la Vega
1988; 
Sánchez-Herráiz
2004; 
Reques

March
at higher latitudes (
Badajoz

) and altitudes (
Sierra de Cabra
: 
Reques
&amp; 
Tejedo
1991

; 
Sierra Morena
: 
Reques
2000

). 
Sexual
maturity is reached at an age of one year (
Sánchez-Herráiz
2004) and the maximum age is around six years (
Reques
2014). 
The
species is threatened by fragmentation and destruction of breeding habitat (

van de 
Vlietet al.
2012), groundwater overexploitation and water pollution (
Salvador
&amp; 
García-París
2001

; 
Barbadillo

; 
Boschet al.
2009

; 
Nuneset al.
2014

). 
ItsIUCN
threat status is Least Concern (

, 9.0; 
FORL
, 20.0; HIL, 52.6; FOL, 16.6; 
FOTL
, 25.4; TIL, 16.5. Body relatively slender; head dorsally flattened, slightly wider than longer, wider than body; snout slightly pointed in dorsal view, rounded and flattened in lateral view; nostrils directed dorsolaterally, slightly protuberant, nearer to tip of snout than to eye; canthus rostralis indistinct, straight; loreal region very slightly concave, almost flat; eye moderately large, notably protuberant dorsally; interocular distance slightly larger than horizontal eye diameter, larger than internarial and eye-nostril distance; pupil vertical; tympanum externally visible, distinct, oval, wider vertically than horizontally, its horizontal diameter being 68% of vertical eye diameter, positioned near corner of mouth; supratympanic fold distinct in its anterodorsal part running from posterior corner of eye to level of forelimb insertion; tongue free posteriorly, of truncated shape, vomerine teeth distinct, in two patches between and at the same level as choanae; choanae moderately sized, ovoid. Premaxillary and maxillary teeth present. Arms slender, webbing almost absent, very small rudiments recognizable; comparative finger length I&lt;II&lt;IV&lt;III, fingers with dermal fringes. No enlarged finger disks. One large, conical subarticular tubercle present proximally on each finger; three flattened metacarpal tubercles; inner and outer metacarpal tubercles of different size (outer slightly larger than inner) and distinctly larger than central tubercle. Black nuptial pads on inner sides of first and second fingers, as one elongate patch on forearm, a second slightly bigger elongate patch on arm, and a small agglomeration on both sides of chest near axilla. Hindlimbs slender; tibiotarsal articulation reaches between eye and nostril when adpressed along body; inner metatarsal tubercle distinct but relatively small, outer metatarsal tubercle absent; proximal subarticular tubercles indistinct, remaining subarticular tubercles absent. Comparative toe length I&lt;II&lt;V&lt;III&lt;IV; third toe distinctly longer than fifth toe; toes with conspicuous dermal fringes to tip. Webbing between toes weakly expressed but clearly present and more than merely an extension of dermal fringes. Webbing formula difficult to determine due to absence of subarticular tubercles and presence of dermal fringes. Skin on the dorsal surface granular, with distinct warts; skin of throat, chest, and venter smooth except granular on posterior most part of belly; ventral surfaces of thighs and arms granular. Especially those warts that coincide with dark greenish spots on dorsum of slightly elongated shape and arranged in longitudinal rows. The anterodorsal part of supratympanic fold is continued into the inguinal region as a distinct row of small tubercles and ridges.

Colour of the 
holotype
: The skin colour is between dark gray to olive brown with drab green bands on the back and legs. The back is dotted with small round or oval prominences of olive colors. The ventral area, which is smooth or slightly rough, has a light colour from pale green to gray tones. Nuptial pads are grass green. Colour in life (

) is more clear with light greenish spots on the back and a design of a drab olive line from the eye to the insertion of anterior legs.

Poorly known. Reproductive phenology is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>P. ibericus</tp:taxon-name>
and takes place early in the season, starting with the first rains at mid-autumn and extending into the winter. More detailed fieldwork is needed to determine the conservation status of populations in some regions (van de 

Vliet 
et al.
2012

; 

Nunes 
et al.
2014

). Given that suitable breeding habitats (i.e., temporary ponds in traditional Mediterranean farmland) are disappearing at an alarming rate in 
Portugal
(
Beja
&amp; Alcazar 2003

) affecting overall Mediterranean biodiversity (

Stoate 
et al.
2009

), it is urgent to assess the conservation status of this species and possibly implement conservation measures. In the Natural Reserve of Paul do Boquilobo (central 
Portugal
), the introduction of the American crayfish (
<tp:taxon-name>Procambarus clarkii</tp:taxon-name>
) resulted in the extinction of local populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>P. atlanticus</tp:taxon-name>
eight years later (

Description of the 
holotype
.

Adult male in excellent state of preservation. Some tissue removed ventrally from right thigh for molecular analysis. Measurements: SVL, 36.6; HW, 12.7; HL, 13.3; TD, 2.7; ED, 4.0; END, 4.3; NSD, 3.0; NND, 3.6; 
HAL
, 10.6; 
FORL
, 23.2; HIL, 61.6; FOL, 18.4; 
FOTL
, 28.5; TIL, 18.4. Body relatively slender; head dorsally flattened, slightly longer than wide, wider than body; snout slightly pointed in dorsal view, rounded in lateral view; nostrils directed dorsolaterally, not protuberant, nearer to tip of snout than to eye; canthus rostralis indistinct, straight; loreal region very slightly concave, almost flat; eye moderately large, notably protuberant dorsally; interocular distance slightly smaller than horizontal eye diameter, larger than internarial and slightly smaller than eye-nostril distance; pupil vertical; tympanum externally visible, distinct, oval, wider vertically than horizontally, its horizontal diameter is 68% of maximum eye diameter, positioned near corner of mouth; supratympanic fold moderately distinct in its anterodorsal part running from posterior corner of eye to posterior corner of tympanum, indistinct in its posteroventral part running from posterior corner of tympanum to insertion of forelimb; tongue free posteriorly, of truncate shape, vomerine teeth distinct, in two patches between and at the same level as choanae; choanae moderately sized, ovoid. Premaxillary and maxillary teeth present. Arms slender, webbing almost absent, very small rudiments recognizable; comparative finger length I&lt;II&lt;IV&lt;III, fingers with dermal fringes (poorly recognizable on small fingers due to fixation). No enlarged finger disks. One large, rounded subarticular tubercle present proximally on each finger; three flattened metacarpal tubercles; inner and outer metacarpal tubercles of similar size and distinctly larger than central tubercle. Black nuptial pads on inner sides of first and second fingers, as one elongate patch on forearm, a second slightly smaller elongate patch on arm, and a small agglomeration on both sides of chest near axilla. Hindlimbs slender; tibiotarsal articulation reaches between eye and nostril when adpressed along body; inner metatarsal tubercle distinct but relatively small, outer metatarsal tubercle absent; proximal subarticular tubercles indistinct, remaining subarticular tubercles absent. Comparative toe length I&lt;II&lt;V&lt;III&lt;IV; third toe distinctly longer than fifth toe; toes with conspicuous dermal fringes to tip. Webbing between toes weakly expressed but clearly present and more than merely an extension of dermal fringes. Webbing formula difficult to determine due to absence of subarticular tubercles and presence of dermal fringes, but webbing almost complete between toes I and II, between second and third phalangeal joint of toe II between toes II and III. Skin on the dorsal surface granular, with distinct warts; skin of throat, chest, and venter smooth except granular on posteriormost part of belly; ventral surfaces of thighs and arms granular. Especially those warts that coincide with dark greeninsh spots on dorsum of slightly elongated shape and arranged in longitudinal rows. The anterodorsal part of the supratympanic fold is continued into the inguinal region as a distinct row of small tubercles and ridges, partly marked by greenish dots.
</p>
            <p>
Colour of the 
holotype
. The skin colour is between dark green to olive drab with light olive bands on the back and legs. The back is dotted with a pattern of small oval and linear prominences of olive green. On the lateral side, a clear band is more or less visible, from the tympanum to the insertion of posterior limbs. The ventral area, which is smooth or slightly rough, has a light colour from pale green to yellow tones. Colour in life is similar, with light greenish spots on the back, instead of drab colors, and a design of two crossed bands clear without dots (

).

            <p>Variation.
In the paratypes EBD 34506 and EBD 34507, the foot webbing is much less distinctly expressed.

is distributed in the Iberian Peninsula and as far as known, restricted to 
Spain
. Its range extends mainly in areas of low and mid-altitude mountains, from the sea level to 
1,900 m
in 
La Rioja
(
Zaldívar 2004
), almost 
2,000 m
in Sierra Seca (
Granada
) and maybe higher at the locality of Castril, 
Granada
(

Fernández-Cardenete 
et al.
2000

), but additional confirmation is required. It occupies most of the eastern and central parts of 
Spain
(Lacomba &amp; Sancho 1999; 
Barbadillo 2002b
). The western range limits are in the southeast of 
Madrid
(
Martínez-Solano &amp; García-París 2001
; 
Martínez-Solano 2006
), in the provinces of León and Zamora, and in the Montes de Toledo in Toledo and Ciudad Real. Southwards the species reaches the northern parts of Jaén and 
Granada
provinces (
Barbadillo 2002b
; 

Ceacero 
et al.
2007

) and coastal parts of Almería (González- 

Miras &amp;

2008

;

<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes hespericus</tp:taxon-name>
is a generalist that tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions and diverse substrates. However, it seems to avoid siliceous and some 
types
of acid soils (Sánchez-Herráiz 2004). It can be found in semi-arid steppes in the Ebro basin and the southeast, as well as in temperate forests of beech and oak, but usually avoids the densest forest formations. It is common in abandoned quarries and cattle ponds and tolerates high levels of salinity. Specimens can reach eight years (males) and 10 years (females) of age (

Esteban 
et al.
2004

; Sánchez-Herráiz 2004).

            <p>Advertisement call and reproductive behavior.
As in the other western 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodytes</tp:taxon-name>
lineages, the call consists of two 
types
of notes (
A
and 
B
), nonetheless emitted just once time. In the recordings previously studied by Sánchez-Herráiz (2004) analyzed by us, and in numerous other individuals heard in the field, one call typically consists of one 
A
note followed by a single 
B
note (

). Reciprocal calls of females have been reported (Sánchez-Herráiz 2004). Calling specimens are found at the edge or within water, with body temperatures between 10 °C –17.5°C (Sánchez-Herráiz 2004; 

Esteban 
et al.
2002

). Call intensity and spectral frequency were not found to be related to the size or age of the male (
