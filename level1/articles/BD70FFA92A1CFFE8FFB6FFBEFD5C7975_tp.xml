         <p>
The thorid shrimp genus 
<tp:taxon-name>LebbeusWhite, 1847</tp:taxon-name>
are heretofore represented by 74 specific taxa worldwide (
Table 1
), of which vast majority are highly localized (e.g., 
Hayashi 1992
; Komai 
et al
. 2004, 2021; 
Marin 2020
). Discovery of new species is still continuing. The Sea of Okhotsk is one of the hot spot areas of the diversity of the genus in spite of the rather high latitudinal location, from where 16 species have been reported (

, has carried out continuous investigation of deep-sea animals of the Nemuro Strait, located at the southwestern part of the Sea of Okhotsk, located at the southwestern part of the Sea of Okhotsk, for exhibition and studies on reproductive biology of deep-sea animals with the cooperation of local fishermen of the Rausu Fisheries Cooperation Association. Taxonomic studies on the collection accumulated during the investigation have much contributed to the documentation of the unexpected rich decapod fauna in the area (e.g.,

<tp:taxon-name>Lebbeus</tp:taxon-name>
on the basis of material found in bycatch of deep-sea shrimp traps and commercial gill nets. In addition, a supplemental note is provided for

Material examined in this study is deposited in the Natural History Museum and Institute, 
Chiba
(CBM), 
Japan
, and the National Museum of Nature and Science, Tsukuba (NSMT), 
Japan
. Size of specimens is indicated by postorbital carapace length (cl) in mm, measured from the rostral base to the midpoint of the posterior carapace margin. Grouping of species within 
<tp:taxon-name>Lebbeus</tp:taxon-name>
according to the number of epipods on pereopods have been widely accepted mainly because of practical usefulness (e.g., 
Butler 1980
; 
Hayashi 1992
; Komai 
et al
. 2004; 
Jensen 2006
). In this study, we also adopt the informal groupings for morphological comparison, although we recognise that such a grouping does not always reflect phylogeny.

DNA barcoding often provides useful genetic information for species delimitation and identification (e.g., 

Costa 
et al
. 2007

). Thus, attempt has been made to sequence the barcoding gene COI and 16S rRNA for the three new species described in this article, as well as three comparative species for which sequences were not available heretofore. Total genomic DNA was extracted from fresh or ethanol-preserved pleopod muscle tissue of specimens, using DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kits (Qiagen, Hilden, 
Germany
) with an elution volume of 100 μl. DNA concentrations were measured and recorded with a NanoDrop Lite spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, DE, 
U.S.A.
). Partial sequences of the mitochondrial COI and 16S rRNA gene were amplified using Tks Gflex DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) following manufacturer instruction. The PCR primers are: LCO1490/HCO2198 (COI; 

Folmer 
et al
. 1994

); 16S-L2 (

Schubart 
et al
. 2002

) and 1472(H2) (
Crandall &amp; Fitzpatrick 1996
) (16S). PCR was carried out with 30 cycles of a 8.03 μl reaction volume containing 2.29 μl sterile distilled water, 3.82 μl 2×Gflex PCR buffer (Takara, Otsu, 
Japan
), 0.38 μl of each primer (5 μM), 0.16 μl of Tks Gflex DNA polymerase (Takara, Otsu, 
Japan
) and 0.7 μl template. The thermal cycle profile after an initial 1 min denaturation at 94°C was as follows: denaturation at 98°C for 10 s, annealing at 50°C for 10 s and extension at 68°C for 10s with the final extension at the same temperature for 7 min. The PCR products were purified using Exo Sap-IT (USB, OH, 
U.S.A.
) to remove redundant dNTPs, primers and nucleotides. Direct sequencing of the purified PCR products was performed with the ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies, CA, 
U.S.
A) and dye-labeled terminators (BigDye terminator v. 1.1; Applied Biosystems, CA, 
U.S.
A). The DNA sequences were edited and assembled by GENETYX-MAC v. 17 (Genetyx, 
Tokyo
, 
Japan
).

Sequences of COI and 16S used in this study are summarised in 
Table 2
. One COI sequence from each previously known species was randomly selected and downloaded from GenBank database except for 
<tp:taxon-name>L. polaris</tp:taxon-name>
. As shown in previous studies, more than one species are represented in COI sequences referred to 
<tp:taxon-name>L. polaris</tp:taxon-name>
(cf. 
Marin 2020
; 

Komai 
et al
. 2021

). We selected five sequences corresponding to five putative species, evaluated with genetic divergence, to reduce analytical procedure. The obtained sequences were aligned using ClustalW, as implemented in the MEGA X (

Stecher 
et al
. 2020

) with default parameters. K2P divergences were calculated on MEGA X.

            <p>Remarks.
The present male specimen (CBM-ZC 16702) differs from the 
type
series of 
<tp:taxon-name>Lebbeus fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
in the slender, slightly sinuous rostrum with six dorsal (the anteriormost tooth is located at the midlength) and nine ventral teeth and the possession of an epipod on the pereopod 1. In the 
type
specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
, consisting of 
four females
and 
one male
, the rostrum is noticeably curved dorsally, with four dorsal and seven or eight ventral teeth; the anteriormost tooth of the dorsal rostral series is located at the proximal 0.2–0.3; the pereopod 1 is devoid of epipod (

Matsuzaki 
et al
. 2015

). Nevertheless, the COI sequence of the male specimen is almost identical (K2P divergence 0.3%; 
Table 3
) with that of one of the ovigerous female specimen (CBM-ZC 16704), which closely agrees with the 
type
series in morphological aspects. Consequently, the male specimen is referred to 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
. This finding indicates that the development of epipod on the pereopod 1 is variable in 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
. Similar variation in the development of the epipod on the pereopod 1 is also known in 
<tp:taxon-name>L. elegans</tp:taxon-name>
, the another species normally lacking epipod on the pereopod 1 (Komai 
et al
. 2004).
</p>
            <p>
Genetic divergences between 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
and other known congeneric species are 3.3–24.9% (COI) (
Table 3
) and 1.1–6.8% (16S) (
Table 4

Morphologically, the present new species is most similar to

            <p>Remarks.
The present male specimen (CBM-ZC 16702) differs from the 
type
series of 
<tp:taxon-name>Lebbeus fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
in the slender, slightly sinuous rostrum with six dorsal (the anteriormost tooth is located at the midlength) and nine ventral teeth and the possession of an epipod on the pereopod 1. In the 
type
specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
, consisting of 
four females
and 
one male
, the rostrum is noticeably curved dorsally, with four dorsal and seven or eight ventral teeth; the anteriormost tooth of the dorsal rostral series is located at the proximal 0.2–0.3; the pereopod 1 is devoid of epipod (

Matsuzaki 
et al
. 2015

). Nevertheless, the COI sequence of the male specimen is almost identical (K2P divergence 0.3%; 
Table 3
) with that of one of the ovigerous female specimen (CBM-ZC 16704), which closely agrees with the 
type
series in morphological aspects. Consequently, the male specimen is referred to 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
. This finding indicates that the development of epipod on the pereopod 1 is variable in 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
. Similar variation in the development of the epipod on the pereopod 1 is also known in 
<tp:taxon-name>L. elegans</tp:taxon-name>
, the another species normally lacking epipod on the pereopod 1 (Komai 
et al
. 2004).
</p>
            <p>
Genetic divergences between 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
and other known congeneric species are 3.3–24.9% (COI) (
Table 3
) and 1.1–6.8% (16S) (
Table 4
).

belongs to the group of species characterised by the possession of epipods only on the maxilliped 3 and pereopod 1, which is represented by seven previously described taxa (
Table 1
). All but 
<tp:taxon-name>L. vicinus montereyensis</tp:taxon-name>
share also a relatively long rostrum that is subequal in the length to or longer than the carapace and a small supraorbital spine lacking an inferior notch (

is notable in having a prominent projection on the proximolateral portion of the antennular stylocerite (

is referred to the species group characterised by having epipods on the maxilliped 3 and pereopods 1 and 2, represented by 23 previously described species (cf. 
Table 1
). The new species is characteristic in having an elongate rostrum being distinctly longer than the carapace, with a poorly developed ventral lamina and a greatly unarmed dorsal margin (the distal 0.6 is unarmed). None of the other species in this group has such an elongate rostrum with few dorsal teeth and a poorly developed ventral lamina (cf.

among the 24 species in the group. The rostrum with a moderately developed ventral lamina is common to the two species; the rostral length exceeds the carapace length in these two species. The unarmed part of the rostrum is greatly variable in 
<tp:taxon-name>L. unalaskensis</tp:taxon-name>
, but some specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>L. unalaskensis</tp:taxon-name>
has a unarmed part of the dorsal margin occupying more than the half length of the rostrum, also being similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>L. tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
in this regard. 
<tp:taxon-name>Lebbeus tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>L. unalaskensis</tp:taxon-name>
by the proportionally longer rostrum (1.4–1.5 times as long as the carapace versus 1.1–1.3 times as long), more numerous dorsal (including postrostral teeth) and ventral teeth on the rostrum (four versus five to seven and three or four versus four to seven, respectively), the relatively large cornea (the corneal width 0.30 of the carapace length versus 0.18–0.21; 

versus 
Kim 2012
: fig. 45) and the more slender pereopods 3–5 (

versus 
Kim 2012
: fig. 45). In addition, 
<tp:taxon-name>L. tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
is much smaller in the body size than 
<tp:taxon-name>L. unalaskensis</tp:taxon-name>
(ovigerous females cl 
10.9–12.4 mm
versus cl 22.0 mm).

is readily distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>L. subtilis</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
by the better developed ventral blade of the rostrum (cf. 

versus 

), the longer antennular stylocerite reaching the distal margin of the peduncular article 1 (versus falling short of it) (

versus 

) and the more slender dactyli of the pereopods 3–5 (cf. 

versus Fig. J–L). The living colouration is also different between the two species: in 
<tp:taxon-name>L. tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp

</named-content>
, there are a few reddish spots on the pleon (

<tp:taxon-name>L. subtilis</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
, the pleon has red transverse bands on pleomeres 1–5 (

The status of 
<tp:taxon-name>L. tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>

<tp:taxon-name>L. tenuipes</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
and the known congeneric species ranges from 7.0 to 21.9% (
Table 3

            <p>Remarks.
The present male specimen (CBM-ZC 16702) differs from the 
type
series of 
<tp:taxon-name>Lebbeus fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
in the slender, slightly sinuous rostrum with six dorsal (the anteriormost tooth is located at the midlength) and nine ventral teeth and the possession of an epipod on the pereopod 1. In the 
type
specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
, consisting of 
four females
and 
one male
, the rostrum is noticeably curved dorsally, with four dorsal and seven or eight ventral teeth; the anteriormost tooth of the dorsal rostral series is located at the proximal 0.2–0.3; the pereopod 1 is devoid of epipod (

Matsuzaki 
et al
. 2015

). Nevertheless, the COI sequence of the male specimen is almost identical (K2P divergence 0.3%; 
Table 3
) with that of one of the ovigerous female specimen (CBM-ZC 16704), which closely agrees with the 
type
series in morphological aspects. Consequently, the male specimen is referred to 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
. This finding indicates that the development of epipod on the pereopod 1 is variable in 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
. Similar variation in the development of the epipod on the pereopod 1 is also known in 
<tp:taxon-name>L. elegans</tp:taxon-name>
, the another species normally lacking epipod on the pereopod 1 (Komai 
et al
. 2004).
</p>
            <p>
Genetic divergences between 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
and other known congeneric species are 3.3–24.9% (COI) (
Table 3
) and 1.1–6.8% (16S) (
Table 4
).

is referred to the species group characterised by having epipods on the maxilliped 3 and pereopods 1 and 2, represented by 23 previously described species (cf. 
Table 1
). The new species is characteristic in having an elongate rostrum being distinctly longer than the carapace, with a poorly developed ventral lamina and a greatly unarmed dorsal margin (the distal 0.6 is unarmed). None of the other species in this group has such an elongate rostrum with few dorsal teeth and a poorly developed ventral lamina (cf.

). Nevertheless, the COI sequence of the male specimen is almost identical (K2P divergence 0.3%; 
Table 3
) with that of one of the ovigerous female specimen (CBM-ZC 16704), which closely agrees with the 
type
series in morphological aspects. Consequently, the male specimen is referred to 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
. This finding indicates that the development of epipod on the pereopod 1 is variable in 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
. Similar variation in the development of the epipod on the pereopod 1 is also known in 
<tp:taxon-name>L. elegans</tp:taxon-name>
, the another species normally lacking epipod on the pereopod 1 (Komai 
et al
. 2004).
</p>
            <p>
Genetic divergences between 
<tp:taxon-name>L. fujimotoi</tp:taxon-name>
and other known congeneric species are 3.3–24.9% (COI) (
Table 3
) and 1.1–6.8% (16S) (
Table 4
).
