         <title>ABSTRACT</title>
         <p>
Two new species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
are described from the 1984–1985 Cerro de la Neblina Expedition in southern 
Venezuela
, together with notes on the genus and a test of its monophyly, which has been challenged in recent studies. The inclusion of new sequences results in a monophyletic 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
that is better supported than in earlier analyses. One of the new species is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
, with which it has been confused previously. This newly described species has, like 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
,

a tadpole with a dorsoventrally flattened body and the largest labial toothrow formula so far reported for anuran larvae (16/21). It differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
in larval characters, adult coloration, and vocalization. The other new species is unique in having a color pattern composed of stellate melanophores over a greenish ground color. Comments on the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
provide details overlooked in previous references to this rare species and stress the need to establish diagnostic characters that might differentiate it from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
. Furthermore, we report one specimen not assigned to any species from Huachamacary Tepui, only 
25 km
from the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
.

So far, all studied species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
have relatively large (
2.8–3.2 mm
), yolky ovarian eggs, a character state shared with several other frogs in 
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aplastodiscus</tp:taxon-name>
,

the 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas benitezi</tp:taxon-name>
species group), and likely a plesiomorphic character state for the tribe. We report and illustrate the occurrence of a mental gland in some species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
and present a short discussion on odorous volatile secretions reported in some species of this genus.

         <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
         <p>
The former 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
group was erected by Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) for two species from the 
Guiana
highlands, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
presented a phylogenetic analysis of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hylidae</tp:taxon-name>
, with emphasis on the subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Hylinae</tp:taxon-name>
. In their analysis, they included a single species of the group that they identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>H. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
. Their results supported a sister-group relationship between this species and former 
<tp:taxon-name>H. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
, a species previously included in the former 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla geographica</tp:taxon-name>
group. Furthermore, these two species are the sister taxa of a pectinated series that includes four genera of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hylinae</tp:taxon-name>
: 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
(a resurrected name for the former 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla armata</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. bogotensis</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. larinopygion</tp:taxon-name>
groups), 
<tp:taxon-name>Bokermannohyla</tp:taxon-name>
(a newly described genus for the former 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla circumdata</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. claresignata</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. martinsi</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. pseudopseudis</tp:taxon-name>
groups), 
<tp:taxon-name>Aplastodiscus</tp:taxon-name>
(redefined to include also the former 
<tp:taxon-name>H. albofrenata</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. albosignata</tp:taxon-name>
complexes of the former 
<tp:taxon-name>H. albomarginata</tp:taxon-name>
group), and 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas</tp:taxon-name>
(a resurrected name for several former species groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla</tp:taxon-name>
). Because of its position, a new genus was erected to contain the former 
<tp:taxon-name>H. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
group, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
,

and, tentatively, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
: 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
(
type
species: 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
).
</p>
         <p>
While 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
is supported by molecular data in the analysis of 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
, morphological data supporting its monophyly are still lacking. In the analyses by 
Wiens et al. (2006)
, which included most sequences from 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
and 
Wiens et al. (2005)
, but analyzing them with different methods, 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
was not recovered as monophyletic, as its two available species formed a polytomy with the clade containing the remaining 
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
. 
A
similar result is reported in 
Wiens et al. (2010)
, although they note that 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
is weakly recovered in their parsimony analysis, while it is not supported in their maximum-likelihood analysis.
</p>
         <p>
In the definition of the former 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
group Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) included several characters, most of which were also shared with species groups now included in 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g., the small nasals, shared with the three species groups; labial toothrow formula [
LTRF
], shared with the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. armatus</tp:taxon-name>
group; vomerine teeth smoothly S- shaped and more numerous, shared with the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. larinopygion</tp:taxon-name>
group) or even with other hylids. One character state they included (strong odor) could support the monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, but it is still unknown in several species, and has been reported in some species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. bogotensis</tp:taxon-name>
group, including 
<tp:taxon-name>H. jahni</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. platydactylus
(
La Marca, 1985
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Faivovich et al. (2005: 89)
warned that their sample of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
did not come from the 
type
locality (“Cumbre del Tepuy Marahuaca-Sur. Estado 
Amazonas
, 
Venezuela
...”) but from Cerro de la Neblina, ca. 
400 km
southward. Our continuing work with these specimens shows that they are not 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
, but a new species described herein.
</p>
         <p>
The former 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
was described by 
Rivero (1961)
based on a single male specimen from Cerro Duida, and this description was supplemented by Rivero (“1971” [1972]) with a second male from the same locality. Since its description the species was rarely mentioned in the literature (see 
Rivero, 1963
, and 
La Marca and Smith, 1982
), until 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
associated it with 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
. 
A
reexamination of the 
holotype
indicates that some comments are in order.
</p>
         <p>
The goals of this paper are to (1) present a new test of the monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
; (2) describe two new species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
from Cerro de la Neblina, one of which was included in the analysis of 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
, including descriptions of their tadpoles and advertisement calls and natural history notes; (3) discuss the status of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
and complement the available descriptions given by 
Rivero (1961
, “ 
1971
” [1972]); and (4) discuss nomenclature, taxonomy, and natural history of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
.

METHODS

         <p>
MEASUREMENTS 
AND
TERMINOLOGY: Webbing formula follows conventions of 
Savage and Heyer (1967)
as modified by 
Myers and Duellman (1982)
. Measurements follow 
Duellman’s (1970)
standards. Abbreviations used throughout the text are: ED (eye diameter), EN (eyenostril distance), FL (foot length), HL (head length), HW (head width), IND (internarial distance), 
IO
(interocular distance), SVL (snout-vent length), TD tympanum diameter), TL (tibia length), TTL (tadpole total length). Sex was determined by examination of secondary sexual characters (nuptial pads, vocal slits, and expansion of the vocal sac) or, when in doubt, by examination of the gonads. We employ Luna et al.’s (2012) terminology for nuptial pads. Larval terminology follows 
Altig and McDiarmid (1999a
, 
1999b
), while staging follows the system of 
Gosner (1960)
. Lateral line descriptions and terminology are based on the review in 
Lannoo (1987)
. Preserved museum specimens were available for 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
sp. All information regarding 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
is that published by Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]), supplemented with photographs of the 
type
series kindly sent by Gilson Rivas. The information on tadpoles of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
is that provided by 
MacCulloch and Lathrop (2005)
.
</p>
         <p>
VOCALIZATIONS: Calls were recorded using Sony TCM 5000 cassette tape recorders, with either an Electrovoice microphone (for 
USNM
tapes) or mostly with TEAC ME 120 electrat or Sennheiser MKE 600 microphones (for 
AMNH
tapes). Original tapes and digital copies are deposited in the tape archives of the Division of Amphibians and Reptiles (
USNM
) and the Department of Herpetology (
AMNH
). Tape recordings of frog calls were converted to electronic format and analyzed using either RAVEN 1.2.1 (
Cornell Lab of Ornithology, 2004
) or a Kay CSL 4500 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (sampling rate 22050 Hz). The waveforms and sound spectrographs in figures 11–13 and 24 were analyzed and printed using the CSL software (Kay Elemetrics Corp. [now KayPentax, Lincoln Park, NJ], also separately available as the Windowsbased software, Multi-Speech). It has been pointed out by 
Myers and Donnelly (2008)
that such sound spectrographs are similar to older analog standards: 
wideband
, with an effective bandwidth filter of 323.00 Hz, and/or 
narrowband
, with an effective bandwidth filter of 63.09 Hz. It is important to note that time measurements of notes were made from wideband spectrograms and/or from the waveforms, whereas statements concerning frequency were derived from narrowband analysis. Failure to distinguish between time and frequency correlated aspects of changing bandwidth has caused ambiguity and confusion in the bioacoustical literature (
Zweifel and Myers, 1989: 11
).
</p>
         <p>
TADPOLES: In the field, tissues of both tadpoles and putative adults were preserved in liquid nitrogen. In the laboratory tadpoles were associated with adults based on absolute sequence similarity between the candidates with a fragment of 16S, the ribosomal gene employed for molecular identification by 
Thomas et al. (2005)
, 
Vences et al. (2005)
, and Randraniaina et al. (2007). Uncorrected pairwise distances (p-distances) of the static alignment of the same 16S fragment used by those authors, in our case delimited by the primers AR-BR (
Palumbi et al., 1991
), were calculated in PAUP* 4.0b10 (
Swofford, 2002
).
</p>
         <p>
DNA ISOLATION, PCR, 
AND
SEQUENCING: Whole cellular DNA was extracted from liquidnitrogen or ethanol preserved tissues with the DNeasy isolation kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Amplification was carried out in a 25 µl reaction using puRe Taq Ready-To-Go PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) or Fermentas Master Mix, using the primers listed by 
Faivovich et al. (2005
: table 2) plus those of Biju and Bossyut (2003) for CXCR4 and 
Wiens et al. (2005)
for a PCR product including fragments of 16S, ND1, and intervening tRNAs. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–amplified products were desalted and concentrated using either GE GFX PCR purification kit or EXO/SAP (Fermentas) and labeled with fluorescent-dye labels terminators (ABI Prism Big Dye Terminators, v. 3.1 cycle sequencing kits; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The labelled PCR products were cleaned using cleanSEQ (Agencourt Biosciences, Beverly, MA). The products were sequenced with an ABI 3730XL (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All samples were sequenced in both directions to check for potential errors. Chromatograms obtained from the automated sequencer were read and contigs made using the sequence editing software Sequencher 3.0. (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Complete sequences were edited with BioEdit (
Hall, 1999
).

         <p>
PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS: 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
is recovered by 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
and 
Wiens et al. (2010
, in their parsimony analysis) as the most basal taxon of the hyline tribe 
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
, which is the sister taxon of the other three hylid tribes (
<tp:taxon-name>Dendropsophini</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Hylini</tp:taxon-name>
+ 
<tp:taxon-name>Lophiohylini</tp:taxon-name>
). Considering the doubts surrounding the monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
and differences among previous analyses, we would have preferred to design a phylogenetic analysis that differs as little as possible from those previous tests. However, in this paper we restricted ourselves to a compilation of all the relevant sequence data available for 
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
plus seven outgroups, to which we added new sequences for some of those same terminal taxa that were previously missing. For outgroups we included exemplars of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hylini</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Acris crepitans</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla cinerea</tp:taxon-name>
), 
<tp:taxon-name>Dendropsophini</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Dendropsophus nanus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudis minutus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Scinax staufferi</tp:taxon-name>
), and 
<tp:taxon-name>Lophiohylini</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Phyllodytes luteolus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Trachycephalus typhonius</tp:taxon-name>
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Phrynomedusa marginata</tp:taxon-name>
, a basal phyllomedusine (
Faivovich et al., 2010
) was used as the root. We will focus on the problem of the monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, not on the several other issues of the systematics of 
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
, although the most obvious results of our analyses will be briefly mentioned, discussed, and further expanded in appendix 1. New sequences were produced for the genes CXCR4 and ND1, and these were added to sequences published by 
Faivovich et al. (2004
, 2005, 2010), 
Salducci et al. (2005)
, 
Wiens et al. (2006)
, 
Antunes et al. (2008)
, 
Kohler et al. (2010)
, 
Lehr et al. (2010)
, and 
Coloma et al. (2012)
. See appendix 2 for list of Genbank numbers.
</p>
         <p>
The rationale for using parsimony as an optimality criterion was advanced by 
Farris (1983)
and discussed by, among others, 
Goloboff (2003)
and 
Goloboff and Pol (2005)
. 
Kluge and Grant (2006)
, 
Grant and Kluge (2009)
, and 
Wheeler (2012)
discussed its conceptualization in a dynamic homology framework (
Wheeler, 1996
). The phylogenetic analysis was done using POY4.1.1 (
Varón et al., 2009
) with equal weights for all transformations. Sequences of 12S, 16S, ND1, and intervening tRNA (valine, leucine, isoleucine) were preliminarily delimited in sections of putative homology (
Wheeler et al., 2006
), and equal-length sequences of nuclear protein-coding genes were considered as static alignments to accelerate the searches. These were performed using the command “Search.” This command implements a “driven” search, building Wagner trees using random addition sequences (RAS), tree bisection and reconnection (TBR) branch swapping followed by Ratchet (
Nixon, 1999
) and tree fusing (
Goloboff, 1999
). The command (Search) stores the shortest trees of each independent run and does final tree fusing using the pooled trees as a source of topological diversity. Four 72-hour runs of Search were made in parallel at the American Museum of Natural History cluster using 32 processors. The resulting trees were submitted to a final round of swapping using iterative pass optimization (
Wheeler, 2003
).
</p>
         <p>
We performed a multiple alignment with Clustal-W (
Thompson et al., 1997
) under default parameters. For the phylogenetic analysis using static parsimony we employed T.N.T., Willi Hennig Society Edition (
Goloboff et al., 2008
). Tree searches were done with a driven new technology search, using 100 as the search level. The strategy included sectorial searches, tree drift, and tree fusing (
Goloboff, 1999
). The driven search was requested to hit the minimum length 100 times. Gaps were considered as a fifth state. Parsimony Jackknife (
Farris et al., 1996
) absolute frequencies were estimated with T.N.T., generating 50 RAS + TBR per replicate, for a total of 1000 replicates. Edition of trees was performed with Winclada (
Nixon, 2002
).

Specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
were collected or recorded at seven of the 12 upland camps established during the Cerro de la Neblina Expedition (
Brewer-Carias, 1988
). Each of these camps is briefly described below and their relative locations are shown in figure 1. 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
was not found during extensive collecting around the Base Camp and in the adjacent lowlands. It clearly is an inhabitant of the highlands.
</p>
         <p>Camp I
consisted of two sites located on the extreme southwestern part of the northern plateau between 
1820–1880 m
; 
00°52′10″ N
, 
66°05′25″ W
. The first site was visited between 
February 7 and 11, 1984
, by William Buck, Charles J. Cole, and others, and located about 
500 m
east on the westernmost promontory (Pico Charles) that was visible from the western lowlands near the Base Camp. The second site was visited from 
January 31 to February 1, 1985
, by Rex Cocroft and others and located closer to the margin of the Cañon Grande; 
9.2 km
NE of Base Camp (fig. 1). The habitat consisted of an open savanna dominated by species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Stegolepis</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Rapateaceae</tp:taxon-name>
), 
<tp:taxon-name>Brocchinia</tp:taxon-name>

, see 
Huber 1995
;

Collecting stations I, III, and X lie on the westerly side of the canyon at 1820–2130 m; stations II, VII, and XI are on the easterly side at 1390– 2100 m. Each nominal new species occurs on both sides of the Cañon Grande. Intercanyon vocalization differences between populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
are striking (pulsatile vs. nonpulsatile) but conceivably related to call sites (unrestrained near streams or confined to plastic bags).
</p>
         <p>Camp II
consisted of three sites all situated in an inundated savanna between 2.5 and 
3.5 km
NE of Pico Phelps between 2085 and 
2100 m
; 
00°50′00″ N
, 
66°58′48″ W
. Pitcher plants (
<tp:taxon-name>Heliamphora</tp:taxon-name>
sp.), clumps of a large bromeliad (
<tp:taxon-name>Brocchinia tatei</tp:taxon-name>
)

, and various ericaceous and xiridaceous species and other bog plants were common in the area; two species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Euterpe</tp:taxon-name>
palms, 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyleria</tp:taxon-name>
sp. (
<tp:taxon-name>Ochnaceae</tp:taxon-name>
), and small bamboos grew in a gallery forest along a small stream that flowed to the west and eventually entered the eastern branch (Cañon Menor) of the Cañon Grande. South of the camp slopes with exposed rocks amidst shrubby 
<tp:taxon-name>Bonnetia neblinae</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Theaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) forest rose abruptly to Pico Maguire. McDiarmid, Mercedes Foster, and Richard G. Zweifel worked the site from 
February 17 to 25, 1984
, and McDiarmid and Alfredo Paolillo were there from 
January 28 to 31, 1985
.
</p>
         <p>Camp III
was located in a moderately flooded savanna dominated by species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Stegolepis</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Brocchinia</tp:taxon-name>
,

and 
<tp:taxon-name>Heliamphora</tp:taxon-name>
; 
<tp:taxon-name>Bonnetia maguireorum</tp:taxon-name>
occurred on exposed rocks and 
<tp:taxon-name>Bonnetia</tp:taxon-name>
sp. formed a gallery along a small stream; about 
5 km
NE Pico Charles and 
13.7 km
NE Base Camp; 
1820 m
; 
00°54′10″ N
, 
66°03′50″ W
. Cole collected here from 
February 16 to 18, 1984
.
</p>
         <p>Camp VII
included two sites; the helicopter camp at 
1850 m
was located in a dense stand of a large terrestrial bromeliad (
<tp:taxon-name>Brocchinia tatei</tp:taxon-name>
) amidst rock outcrops, and the river camp was about 20 min. by trail to the east and along a stream that flowed into the Cañon Menor through cloud forest at 
1730 m
; the sites were near the edge of an escarpment, which to the south rose to about 
2250 m
, and were about 
1 km
NE Pico Maguire and 
5 km
NE Pico Phelps between 1730 and 
1850 m
; 
00°50′40″ N
, 
65°58′10″ W
. Myers and Alfred Gardner helped establish Camp VII on 
November 28, 1984
; Myers worked there with Linda Ford until the camp was evacuated on December, 3, 1984. Gardner was again in the camp from 
January 27 to February 14, 1985
; Cocroft and Paolillo collected frogs and tadpoles along the stream between 
February 10 and 14, 1985
; Cocroft recorded frogs here as well.
</p>
         <p>Camp IX
was occupied for only a single day because the terrain made helicopter landing difficult. The general area was steep and along a stream that formed the headwaters of the Río Baría and flowed SW into the Cañon Grande; David H. Benzing and Thomas J. Givnish worked the area on 
February 2, 1985
, between 1780 and 
1830 m
; 
1°00′00″ N
, 
65°53′00″ W
; gallery forest bordered the stream which flowed through relatively dense scrub dominated by ericaceous and cyperaceous plants, species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Brocchinia</tp:taxon-name>
,

and an especially large 
<tp:taxon-name>Heliamphora</tp:taxon-name>
sp. 
A
single tadpole was taken in the stream.
</p>
         <p>Camp X
was established near a burned area on the north side of the massif near the edge of Cañon Grande, 
12.5 km
NNW Pico Phelps, 
00°54′40″ N
, 
66°02′30″ W
. McDiarmid and Buck worked a rocky area between 1930 and 
2130 m
from 
February 12 to 14, 1985
. The habitat was described by 
Givnish et al. (1986)
and included large 
<tp:taxon-name>Bonnetia maguireorum</tp:taxon-name>
on the rocky ridges and hillsides and smaller ones in the bottoms; three small creeks anastomosed to form a small stream that emptied abruptly into the Cañon Grande at about 
1690 m
.
</p>
         <p>Camp XI
was a major camp established on the east slope facing the Cañon Menor about 
2.5 km
NNW Camp VII and 
6.2 km
NNE Pico Phelps between 1390 and 
1515 m
(
00°51′45″ N
, 
65°58′52″ W
). Four distinct habitats were accessible: the heliport was on a large flat rock on the slope at 
1515 m
in the midst of dense scrub forest of 
<tp:taxon-name>Tyleria</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Ochnaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) and 
<tp:taxon-name>Brocchinia</tp:taxon-name>
; the camp itself was in this scrub forest at about 
1490 m
; a rocky stream (
1–4 m
wide) with large boulders, pools, and cascades flowed through dense gallery forest and was accessible at about 
1450 m
, and a dense cloud forest with large moss-covered rocks was reachable at lower elevations to about 
1390 m
. McDiarmid, Paolillo, Cocroft, and several others were there from 
February 25 to March 1, 1985
.

RESULTS 
OF THE
PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS
</title>
         <p>
The phylogenetic analysis using direct optimization resulted in two optimal trees (length 25,161 steps) that were hit 974 times during the driven search. Our phylogenetic analyses including all relevant sequences for 
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
with additional evidence resulted in a supported 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
(91% jackknife absolute frequency in the static parsimony analysis with gaps considered as fifth state), with 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
being the sister taxon of the two new species (fig. 2). Our results continue to support the position of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
as the sister taxon of the remaining four genera of 
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
. Furthermore, the monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aplastodiscus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Bokermannohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas</tp:taxon-name>
is corroborated, as are the relationships among these first hypothesized by 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
. See discussion for further reference to the phylogenetic results.

FIG. 2. One of the most parsimonious trees obtained with direct optimization (length 25161 steps). Differences with the topology obtained with static parsimony are minimal and involve poorly supported nodes. The circle indicates the nodes that collapse in the strict consensus. The new species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
are underlined. Values around nodes are jackknife parsimony absolute frequencies calculated using the static parsimony analysis. Nodes lacking values have &lt;50% absolute jackknife frequencies. The internal relationships of

ETYMOLOGY: The species name 
<tp:taxon-name>chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
is a noun in apposition. It is derived (like that of the lizard genus 
Chamaelo
) from Latin 
chamaeleon
&lt;Greek 
chamaileōn
, a kind of lizard—in reference to this frog’s similar ability to change coloration.
</p>
         <p>

A
species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
characterized by (1) SVL of male 44.6–49.6; female 46.0–56.9; (2) presence of two nuptial pads; (3) absence of a row of tubercles along the ventrolateral edge of the arm; (4) an externally evident mental gland in males; (5) thighs and shank without longitudinal bars; (6) dorsal color pattern with stellated melanophores over a ground color; (7) presence of a slip of m. depressor mandibulae that originates on the dorsal fascia at the level of the m. levator scapulae; (8) unpigmented eggs; (9) tadpoles with globular body; (10) fins reaching the base of the tail; (11) labial tooth row formula (
LTRF

         <p>
COMPARISON 
WITH OTHER SPECIES
: The new species differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
,
<named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
, by having two nuptial pads, and by its dorsal color pattern (stellated melanophores over a ground color), with yellowish flanks in life, the absence of a row of tubercles along the ventrolateral edge of the arm, and the presence of a slip of m. depressor mandibulae that originates on the dorsal fascia at the level of the m. levator scapulae (absent on 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
; unknown in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
). The color pattern differentiates the new species from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
(marbled with copper and dark brown; dark brown bars on arms, thighs and shanks). The new species can also be differentiated from 
<tp:taxon-name>H. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
because of its larger males (44.6–49.6, vs. 37.0– 
37.8 mm
, ẍ= 37.4, 
n
= 5, in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), more robust body (slender in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), more developed prepollex (proportionally reduced in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), and its unpigmented eggs (eggs completely pigmented in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
). Furthermore, tadpoles of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
have a more reduced labial tooth row formula than those of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblina</tp:taxon-name>
(maximum 6/11 vs. a minimum of 10/ 
17 in<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
; tadpoles unknown in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
), but larger than in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
(2/4; 
MacCulloch and Lathrop, 2005
, but see discussion).

COLORATION 
OFHOLOTYPEIN
LIFE: From field notes taken by Cole (
Feb. 7, 1984
): Dorsum reddish brown (as at night when caught) but sometimes changing to light green when awakened in daytime, with numerous scattered dark brown dots. Sides, anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs, and ventral surfaces of lower legs orangish gold, but much duller on legs than on sides (bright). Throat pale green. Ventral surfaces of arms, chest, and abdomen translucent, with pinkish purple showing through. Iris black with an intricate metallic copper reticulum.
</p>
         <p>
COLORATION 
OFHOLOTYPEIN
PRESERVATIVE: The dorsal ground coloration is light cream. The dorsum of body, forelimbs, and hind limbs are homogenously covered by two types of chromatophores that vary in size. The larger ones are brown and stellate, with creamy white centers. The smaller are round glossy white guanophorelike units. The fact that some of these have white stellated arms raises the possibility that these are early stages in the maturating process of the brown units described above, or considering that this species easily changes color in life, they could be just different physiologic stages of the same pigment unit. Pigment is nearly absent from the margins of the eyelid, where the background coloration is creamy yellow. The large chromatophores are less abundant or absent in the hidden areas of thighs, shanks and feet, as well as on the dorsal surfaces of the hands and feet. They are absent on the flanks of the body, where only small chromatophores are present. The ventral coloration of body, throat, and surfaces of limbs is slightly paler than the dorsal ground color.
</p>
         <p>
VARIATION AMONG 
PARATYPES
: Morphological variation is relatively low. On specimens 
USNM
562051, 562054, 562060, 562062–64, which were fixed with their thumbs slightly deflected, the outer metacarpal tubercle is more obvious, as are several large, flat supernumerary tubercles on the proximal surfaces of the digits. With the exception of 
USNM
562061 and 
AMNHA-
131176, most 
paratypes
, unlike the 
holotype
, have a median notch on the subarticular tubercle of finger IV. Males show two discrete nuptial pads (fig. 6 
A
), that in a few cases almost coalesce medially because of the proliferation of epidermal projections (fig. 6B) into the space separating the glandular pads.
</p>
         <p>
Variation of the webbing formula can be expressed as: 
I
(1½–2)–(2–2

(1

n
= 17): 10–18 (right, ẍ = 14.3) and 10–18 (left, ẍ = 13.7).
</p>
         <p>
Most evident variation involves the dorsal coloration and pattern (figs. 3, 7). Several 
paratypes
, most of them from Camp I (
USNM
562048, 562054, 562064, 562063, 
AMNHA-
131174) but also from camps II (
USNM
562051) and X (
USNM
562058) have a larger number of dorsal chromatophores, which makes them appear brown. Of these 
USNM
562048 has dark brown irregular blotches covering the dorsum and dorsal

COLORATION 
IN
LIFE 
OF
SOME 
PARATYPESAND
REFERRED SPECIMENS: We describe the variation in coloration and pattern based on descriptions of live specimens taken from field notes of McDiarmid, Myers, and Zweifel. Unless specified otherwise, notes were taken during the day and are presented here by camp number. 
Camp II.USNM
562049–50: Both went from bright grass green to brownish olive dorsally (brown specks on 
USNM
562049); sides bright yellow (
USNM
562049) to very pale yellow (
USNM
562050); yellow line on upper eyelid; blue green in all joints ventrally; center of chin and chest area blue green flesh; opalescent white where peritoneum shows; viscera visible in part through belly; iris bright coppery in bright sun. 
USNM
562051: Dorsally brown, light tan upper eyelids, bright yellow orange sides and anterior/posterior thighs; tan line along outer finger and toe; white rump patch; venter opalescent yellowish white on chin, pectoral area and belly; fleshy colored on forearms; toe pads whitish ventrally, pale greenish white dorsally; iris bright gold and brown (McDiarmid’s field notes, 
Feb. 16, 1984
). 
AMNHA-
131176: The dorsal ground color of the head and body is light tan. The forearms and shanks are the same ground color, whereas there is merely a yellowish brown strip along the upper surface of the thigh. 
A
pattern of small, yellowish, elongate spots is present over the head, body, lower arm and shank, extending along the foot. Webbing of the hind feet is sparse and tanish. The sides of the body, especially posteriorly, are an orange shade, which also extends onto the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thigh, but is less intense there. The chin is patternless with a yellowish tan tinge. The remaining ventral surfaces are grayish tan and translucent, so that the organs are at least dimly visible (Zweifel’s field notes, 
Feb. 17, 1984
).

REMARKS: The skin on the chin and anterior half of the gular area is glandular in all males when viewed with strong incident light and appears thicker than the loose skin of the vocal sac. On a few specimens the glands are evident externally without magnification (fig. 8). Superficial dissection of the skin of male 
paratypeUSNM
562058 reveals macroscopically evident glandular tissue (fig. 9). The prepollex is equally enlarged in males and females (figs. 5, 10). Two specimens partially dissected when tissue samples were removed (
USNM
562061 
♀
, and 
USNM
562057 
♂
) show a parietal peritoneum partially covered with what seem to be iridophores at the level of flanks and dorsal body wall. The urinary bladder of the male is densely covered with the same putative iridophores (removed from the female when tissues were sampled), and the testes are ovoid, somewhat flattened, and unpigmented (left testis length 
6.9 mm
; SVL 
46.6 mm
). The female (SVL 
51.2 mm
) has large, unpigmented, ovarian eggs. The dissected left ovary (the right one was left intact) contained 
54 eggs
with largest diameter 
2.9–3.1 mm
(ẍ = 3.02; s = 0.07; 
n
= 15). Females are generally larger than males (SVL 46.0– 
56.9 mm
; males 
44.6–49.6 mm
), with two (
USNM
562066 and 562068) of the five females having SVL within the SVL range of the males. Superficial dissections in male 
USNM
562058 reveal the m. intermandibularis with a large diamond-shaped aponeurosis, through which the m. genioglossus is visible by transparency; no fibers of the m. intermandibularis contact the oval and araphic m. submentalis. Supplementary elements of the m. intermandibularis absent. Muscle depressor mandibulae with a differentiated slip that originates on the dorsal fascia at the level of the m. levator scapulae; tympanic origin contiguous with the belly that originates from the otic ramus of the squamosal.

         <p>
We consider that the description of blue-green coloration described in the joints, and mental and ventral areas of living specimens, is very likely an indication of the occurrence of physiological chlorosis (
Barrio, 1965a
).

         <p>
It is worth noting that the partial 16S sequences of juvenile referred specimen 
USNM
562056, and tadpole 
USNM
562723 from Camp VII are 1.1% different from those of specimens from the almost adjacent Camp XI (
2.5 km
SSE) and the more distant camps I and X (table 1). Interestingly, the vocalizations of 
USNM
562065 (
USNM
tape 68), also from Camp VII are indistinguishable from those of 
USNM
562060 (Camp XI); differences in vocalizations with specimens 
USNM
562054 (Camp I), and 
AMNHA-
131178 (Camp III) are discussed below. Morphologically, all these adult specimens appear indistinguishable.

ECOLOGY 
AND
NATURAL HISTORY: Most specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
were found along or near streams. During the day, frogs were found in two 
types
of plants, the leaves of which formed rosettes and held considerable water; at night they were found on vegetation and rocks along streams or in surrounding forest. Near Camp I, a male (
USNM
562048) was found during the day hidden among the leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>Bonnetia maguireorum</tp:taxon-name>
growing along a stream. 
A
snake (
<tp:taxon-name>Leptophis cupreus</tp:taxon-name>
) was photographed the following day (
Feb. 11, 1984
) as it searched the axils of these plants, presumably foraging for frogs (
Albuquerque and McDiarmid, 2010
). Two males (
AMNHA-
131173–74) had been previously located (
Feb. 7, 1984
) as they called from the leafy part of these plants, and another male (
AMNHA-
131178) was found 10 days later near Camp III also calling from a 
<tp:taxon-name>Bonnetia</tp:taxon-name>
plant. Seven juveniles (SVL 28.6–34.0 mm) were collected from the large terrestrial bromeliad, 
<tp:taxon-name>Brocchinia tatei</tp:taxon-name>
, which grew in large patches near Camp II and Camp VII. Three from Camp II (
USNM
562049–50, 
USNM
562052) were collected during the day from the outer axils of a bromeliad growing along a small stream; both were in a head-up position. 
A
fourth (
AMNHA-
131175) was hiding in a partly dead, rolled-up leaf and another (
AMNHA-
131175) was found in a bromeliad. Two other juveniles (
USNM
562052–53) were found together in the central axil of a 
<tp:taxon-name>Brocchinia</tp:taxon-name>
in the same area. 
A
seventh juvenile was found at night (
Feb. 12, 1985
, 19:30–21:30 hr) on a leaf of a 
<tp:taxon-name>Brocchinia</tp:taxon-name>
about 
1 m
above the ground near the heliport of Camp VII. 
A
gravid female (
USNM
562062) was found in the back of a cave adjacent to a creek ESE (above) of Camp I at 14:00 hr. Three frogs (
USNM
562054, 
USNM
562063–64) formed a chorus around a 
3 m
wide and&gt; 
1 m
deep pool in the creek near Camp I (20:30–21:30 hr). One was taken from moss on a rock face 
5 cm
above the water, and two were calling from vegetation along the shore and about 
10 cm
above the water.

(SVL 46.0–

) collected during the expedition were all found between January 31 and February 26, and all were gravid. Likewise, all adult males (SVL 
44.6–49.6 mm
, 
n
= 16) had well-developed nuptial pads and were assumed to be in breeding condition. Calling males were heard at night along streams near camps I, III, VII, and XI during the same period.

VOCALIZATIONS: Recordings of calling males are available from four camps on opposite sides of the Cañon Grande (fig. 1). Recordings from east of the great canyon (camps VII, XI) are of males calling from along streams, whereas those from west of the canyon (camps I, III) are of frogs calling in camp from plastic bags. These segregate as two call 
types
, one characterized by pulsatile notes (eastern camps), and the other is characterized by nonpulsatile notes (plastic-bag recordings from western camps). These are described separately and then compared.
</p>
         <p>Calls with Pulsatile Notes:A
male was recorded calling on a vertical stem 
1.5 m
above streamside at Camp VII, at an air temperature of 14° C (
USNM
562065 on 
USNM
tape 68). Two males were recorded at Camp XI at an air temperature of 17° C (
USNM
562059–562060 on 
USNM
tape 70); the first was calling from the lower leaves of a bromeliad 
1.5 m
above a pool in the stream, while the second called from the lower, dead leaves of a bromeliad nearly 
2 m
above streamside.
</p>
         <p>
The call is a short-to-long train of well-spaced, short notes given at a rate of about 1–2 notes/ sec at 14°–17° C. Note duration is about 0.04 sec (32–51 ms, ẍ = 44.3 ± 5 ms, 
n
= 29). Each note is composed of several poorly resolved pulses that are indicated on wideband spectrograms (fig. 11B) but which are best visualized from expanded waveforms (fig. 11D). The individual note is a short “beep” composed of two harmonics, including a weak fundamental frequency at about 1100 Hz and a strong dominant frequency at about 2200 Hz.
</p>
         <p>Calls with Nonpulsatile Notes:
One of three males was recorded calling from a plastic bag at Camp I at an air temperature of 17° C (recording of one of 
USNM
562054, 562063–562064 on 
USNM
tape 67:17). 
A
male collected at Camp III male was recorded in a plastic bag at the lowland Base Camp three days after capture, at an air temperature of 24° C (
AMNHA-
131178 on 
AMNH
Herpetology Reel 250).
</p>
         <p>
The calls of the frogs in plastic bags are given at rates of about 1.2 notes/sec at 17° C and up to about 4 notes/sec at 24° C. Note duration of the nonpulsatile notes is about 0.02 sec (17–27 ms, ẍ = 22.3 ms, 
n
= 18). Most notes in the two recordings were examined by expanding the waveforms and were seen, without exception, to be nonpulsatile. The note is a short “beep” composed of two harmonics at about 950 Hz and 1900 Hz; the first or fundamental frequency is also the dominant frequency. The note is frequency modulated, with an initial increase followed by a steep decrease; owing to the shortness of the note, this modulation is barely indicated in figure 12C (but see fig. 13A′).

</p>
         <p>Pulsatile and Nonpulsatile Notes Compared:
The descriptions above and figures 11–12 show both similarities and differences in the notes. The pulsatile note is longer (about 0.04 sec) and has a weak fundamental frequency at about 1100 Hz, whereas the nonpulsatile (single-pulse) note is half as long (about 0.02 sec) and has a strong fundamental/dominant frequency at about 950 Hz. Each is frequency modulated in a similar way, with a sharp rise and subsequent sharp decline in the second harmonic; slight frequency modulation occurs also in the first harmonic of the nonpulsatile note.
</p>
         <p>Frequency modulation in the longer pulsatile note is evident in a standard narrowband spectrogram (fig. 11C), but not so obvious in the shorter nonpulsatile note (fig. 12C). However, it becomes evident in the shorter note when an exemplar is graphed at a different analysis size (fig. 13A′).</p>

</p>
         <p>
Clearly two different call 
types
are involved, although their biological significance is uncertain. Slight divergence of the calls may have occurred on opposite sides of the great Cañon Grande of Cerro de la Neblina. On the other hand, perhaps confinement (in plastic bags) induced a call different from the normal advertisement call. In any case, we could find no external morphological differences among the specimens.

TADPOLES: The uncorrected pairwise distances of the 16S sequences (table 1), indicates that the sequence of tadpole 
USNM
562718 is similar (0%–0.2%) with those of the adult 
paratypesUSNM
562048, 562057, 562061. All these have a 0.9%–1.1% uncorrected p-distance with sequences of a tadpole 
USNM
562723 and juvenile 
USNM
562056, these from Camp VII. Conversely, these are 12.5%–13.6% different from the sequences of available specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
. Considering the small distances or identical sequences, we consider this tadpole and all others with the same general morphology (see below) to be larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
. We describe a typical larva of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
(fig. 14) and then comment on the variation found in other available material.

Teeth in rows P-1 through P-4 more robust and about one-third to onehalf longer than those of more posterior rows. Several (3–5), short tooth rows scattered lateral to primary tooth rows and on folded area of oral disc. Jaw sheaths pigmented; upper sheath narrow, slightly wider (M- shaped) medially, long and shallowly arched with short serrations; lower sheath moderately wide, V- shaped with small, pointed serrations, that are larger than those on upper jaw sheath.

         <p>
Neuromasts are usually visible in tadpoles of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
and appear as lines of round, whitish dots on the head, body, and tail. Their topography is complex and most obvious in darkly colored specimens from Camp III (
USNM
562721); they are difficult to see in pale or bicolored specimens. In the Camp III tadpoles, the supraorbital line includes 13–15 neuromasts that converge anteriorly on the head between the nares and continue anteroventrally onto the snout where it approaches the anterior extent of the infraorbital series of 15–19 neuromasts; occasionally a single preorbital neuromast is visible. The oral series is indistinct and variable (also noted for many species by 
Lannoo, 1987
). In some tadpoles it consists of a longitudinal row of 4–6 neuromasts and an anterior, ascending line, sometimes V- shaped, of 3–5 neuromasts; in others, only a few scattered neuromasts occur in the oral region. An angular series of 4–5 neuromasts is visible below the eye. 
A
postorbital series consists of two dorsal (supra-) and two ventral (infra-) neuromasts. 
A
row of 8–10 neuromasts located dorsolaterally on the body is continuous with 4–5 neuromasts in the dorsal row at the base of the tail fin; on the body this dorsolateral series forms a loop and joins a lateral series of 10–12 that continues onto the tail as the middle caudal series consisting of 6–8 neuromasts. About halfway along the tail this middle series projects dorsally (3–4 neuromasts) and continues posteriorly (11–13 neuromasts) along the tail-fin juncture to near the tail tip. 
A
ventral body row of 13–14 neuromasts extends from near the vent tube anterodorsally above the spiracle to a point between the dorsal loop and the postorbital series.

February 7, 1984
, by Cole from pools in a small stream near Camp I were black with globular bodies. Clear evidence of ontogenetic change from clear fins to black fins can be seen in this series. Tail tips were usually clear. Five other specimens from Camp I (

January 31, 1985
, between 10:00 and 13:00 hr. These tadpoles also were dark brownish black with clear tail tips.
</p>
         <p>
Three tadpoles were collected from a small stream (
0.6–1.2 m
wide, 
30–60 cm
deep) near Camp II. One (
USNM
562719; stage 25; TTL 
40 mm
; 
LTRF

Feb. 18, 1984
) is light brownish with nearly transparent fins with small, scattered patches of melanin, a clear tail tip, and transparent belly. Two other pale specimens (
USNM
562720; stage 25; TTL 
54–56 mm
; 
LTRF
5/9) were collected by Paolillo on 
January 30, 1985
, from a small hollow beneath a rock; his notes indicate that they were feeding on the white sand bottom of the stream.
</p>
         <p>
Six black specimens (

56–71 mm

LTRF
4/7 [damaged mouth], 4/8-9 [broken series], 4/9, 5/9[3]) were collected in a stream near Camp III by Cole on 
February 18, 1984
. Several of these had broken tail tips, but it is not clear whether this reflected attempted predation or collection damage; all intact tips were clear.
</p>
         <p>
Cocroft and Paolillo collected tadpoles during the days of February 10–11 and on the night of 
February 12, 1985

29 specimens
(

USNM
562723, tissue voucher; stage 25; TTL

1 m
deep; several larger tads seen during the day in a large pool&gt; 
1 m
deep eluded capture. At night the tadpoles were sensitive to light and substrate vibrations and quickly took cover under rocks. The water temperature at 11:30 hr was 14° C. Two color phases were seen (Cocroft’s field notes, 
Feb. 11–12, 1985
): black, sometimes with a lighter tail, and greenish gray (we assume these greenish tadpoles were larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
because adults of this species were collected here). Fin tips of the darker ones varied from clear to dark. One tadpole (TTL 
35–40 mm
estimate, tail broken at 
29 mm
) had a damaged tail that appears to have resulted from attempted predation. Another (TTL 
45 mm
) had a regenerated tail tip (distal 
7 mm
) that was transparent and slightly narrower. Several tadpoles in this series had irregular clumps of melanophores on their bodies and tail, and one in poor condition had what appeared to be a fungal infection of the oral disc near the mouth.

         <p>
Three other samples of tadpoles were collected by Myers and Ford on 
December 1–2, 1984
, at the same site. Fifteen of 16 tadpoles (
AMNHA-
123713) were in stage 25 and measured 
24–61 mm
TTL; the largest from this series was 
75 mm
TTL at stage 35with an 
LTRF
of 6/10, while the others ranged from 4/7 to 6/10. Two other specimens collected at the same time were metamorphs at stage 41; their tooth rows were starting to break up (
AMNHA-
123711 at 
68 mm
TTL had an 
LTRF
of 5/10, and 
AMNHA-
123712 at the same size had an 
LTRF
of 4/7).

         <p>A
single brownish tadpole was collected during the day (
Feb. 2, 1985
) in a stream that formed the headwaters of the Río Baría and flowed SW into the Cañon Grande (Camp IX; 
1780–1830 m
; 
1°00′00″ N
, 
65°53′00″ W
). The tadpole (
USNM
562724; stage 25; TTL 
29 mm
; 
LTRF
4/7) has an obviously bicolored tail, similar to that illustrated in figure 14; the anterior third is light and the fins are transparent, while the posterior two-thirds is dark with densely distributed melanophores in the fins; the tail tip is transparent.
</p>
         <p>
Several tadpoles collected in the stream below Camp XI are also in stage 25. 
A
single specimen (
USNM
562725; TTL 
62 mm
; 
LTRF
5/10) was taken in slow-moving water about 
5 cm
deep on 
February 25, 1985
. Nine tadpoles (
USNM
562726, 
USNM
562727 [described]; TTL 
37-61 mm
; 
LTRF
4/8[4], 4/9, 5/8, 5/10[2], 5/11) netted by McDiarmid on 
February 26, 1985
(19:30–21:30 hr), were uniform dark brown or bicolored; all had clear tail tips. Nine other specimens (
USNM
562728; TTL 
24–64 mm
; 
LTRF
4/7[1], 4/8[4], 4/9, 5/9[2], 6/9) collected on 
February 27, 1985
, by Paul Spangler during the day were all dark. Two other specimens (
USNM
562729; TTL 
47–49 mm
; 
LTRF
5/9, 5/8) were both uniform dark. Most of the tadpoles from Camp XI had lateral tooth rows.
</p>
         <p>Comments
: Twelve lots of 
109 larvae
of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
were collected at six sites on Cerro de la Neblina. Even though the size ranged from 
23 to 80 mm
TTL, all but three specimens were in stage 25. 
A75 mm
TTL tadpole was in stage 35, and two 
68 mm
TTL individuals in stage 41; tooth rows in both of the latter were starting to fall out down. LTRFs varied from 4/7 to 5/11 and 6/10, with the lower numbers found in smaller individuals. No variation was observed in the positions or sizes of the toothrow gaps. All specimens from camps I and III were more globular (body shape) and densely pigmented, being nearly all black (body, tail, and fins) compared to most tadpoles from the other sites. Tadpoles from camps II, VII, IX, and XI were either uniform brown or bicolored with anterior part of tail pale. The latter specimens were usually found in smaller, often faster-flowing streams bordered by gallery forests that provided more shaded habitats. In contrast, the larger, black specimens generally were from open, exposed streams with larger, pool-type habitats. Intraspecific morphological differences among tadpoles have been noted by previous workers (
Jennings and Scott, 1993
; R.W.M., personal obs.), and we interpret the differences in coloration and body proportions of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
tadpoles as reflecting differences between habitats. Increased melanic pigmentation might counter the potential negative consequences of increased exposure to predation and solar radiation in more open habitats. Whether ontogenetic increases in melanism and larger body size reflect differences in food availability and growth (
Altig and McDiarmid, 1999b
) or are associated with distastefulness and aposematic coloration (
Brodie and Formanowicz, 1987
) remain to be demonstrated. See table 1 for 16S distances among samples from different camps. The few samples available do not allow us to establish any significant association between these morphological differences and the p-distances that we observe.
</p>
         <p>
In an effort to determine any ontogenetic change in LTRFs, we divided the Camp VII sample of 
29 specimens
(
USNM
562722 [28], 
USNM
562723) into five size categories and recorded the 
LTRF
for each tadpole in each size class (those with damaged oral discs or broken tails were not included). The results are as follows: 
1.
TTL &lt;
30 mm
: LTRFs 3/4 (
N
=1), 4/6(1); 
2.
TTL 
30–39 mm
: LTRFs 4/7(3), 4/8(3), 4/9(1), 5/6(1), 5/8(1), 5/9(1); 
3.
TTL 
40–49 mm
: LTRFs 4/8(1), 4/9(3), 5/9(4); 
4.
TTL 
50–59 mm
: LTRFs 4/7(1), 4/8 (1), 5/10(2) 5/11(1); TTL&gt;59: LTRFs 4/7(1). Though preliminary, three patterns emerge. First and not unexpectedly, smaller individuals generally have smaller LTRFs, and the smallest value (3/4) was in the smallest tadpole (
23 mm
). In contrast and in spite of the tendency for larger tadpoles to have more labial tooth rows, the largest 
LTRF
value (5/11) was not in the largest tadpole (TTL 
71 mm
) but in a smaller one (TTL 
59 mm
); in this specimen the P-11 row was weakly developed and barely discernible. That all of these specimens were in stage 25 and showed more than a threefold increase 
4
in

size (TTL 
23–71 mm
) without a concomitant change in development suggests a long-lived tadpole. Another sample of 
26 specimens
from Camp I (
AMNHA-
131171) showed the same pattern; all were in stage 25 and ranged between 33 and 
80 mm
TTL. The low water temperatures (14° C) and relatively low nutrient content of most of the Neblina streams likely contributes to a relatively slow growth rate. The size range in a single developmental stage (stage 25) was surprising and reinforces previous observations of a decoupling of size, developmental stage, and age in many tadpoles. One of the largest 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
tadpoles (
AMNHA-
123713) was also collected at Camp VII; it was in stage 35, measured 
75 mm
TTL, and had an 
LTRF
of 6/10. That it was only 
4 mm
larger than the largest stage 25 individual collected from this same stream and smaller than the largest specimen (
80 mm
TTL) at the same stage from Camp I, suggests a larval growth curve in this species different from that reported for most other anurans for which data are available (e.g., see table and plots from Middle American hylids in 
Duellman, 1970
). Why much of the growth is apparently concentrated in the earliest larval stage in this species, as contrasted to a less skewed and more evenly distributed size range with a typical sigmoid-shaped growth curve as reported for most tadpoles, is unknown. We saw no evidence of size-related predator pressure in these environments that might select for a faster growth and larger size early in development. 
A
cursory review of growth data for Middle American tadpoles (
Duellman, 1970
) showed that 25%–50% of the maximum size is attained in pond tadpoles by stage 25, while stream species may reach more than 65% of their maximum size in the same stage. Together, these data imply a slower developmental rate for tadpoles living in stream compared to pond habitats. The lower productivity and generally cooler temperatures found in stream habitats may account for most of this pattern. Whether this is age dependent remains to be shown.
</p>
         <p>A
second observation relates to the lack of a detectable pattern in either sequence or synchrony in the addition of anterior and posterior tooth rows. In the Camp VII sample, anterior rows increase by only a single row within a size class (e.g., 
4–5 in
categories 3 and 4) and two rows overall (3–5), while posterior rows increase within size categories by up to four rows (
6–9 in
category 2) and as many as seven rows (4–11) overall. The smaller size of teeth in the distal rows (fig. 14) indicates that rows are added distally on both labia; this pattern was reported for many stream dwelling hylids by 
Altig and Johnson (1989)
and has been observed in other forms as well (R.W.M., personal obs.).
</p>
         <p>4
This size discrepancy may be greater as larger tadpoles were seen in the same habitats at the time but not collected.
</p>
         <p>
Finally, we suspect that individual variation (either ecological or genetic) in growth rates of tadpoles of certain species, especially of long-lived, stream inhabiting forms, may override any ontogenetic pattern of toothrow addition, if such exists, and result in an 
LTRF
in the largest specimen that is less than the maximum possible value. Accordingly, some individual larvae may reach a developmental stage (stage 41) approaching metamorphosis without ever having achieved the highest possible 
LTRF
value for the population. Based on examination of all tadpoles of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
taken on Cerro de la Neblina, the maximum possible 
LTRF
value is 6(6)/11(1). No single specimen examined had that value. More detailed studies examining the trade-offs and interactions between size, developmental stage, and age, especially with species that have high LTRFs, are needed before we understand what is involved in the ontogeny of stream-breeding hylid tadpoles.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER SPECIES: 
Myersiohyla loveridgei
is most similar to 
M. aromatica
, from which it apparently differs by the presence of a distinct tarsal ridge (absent in 
M. aromatica
; Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). The presence of two nuptial pads differentiates 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. inparquesi
, 
M. kanaima
, and 
M. neblinaria
. Dorsal color pattern and the presence of a row of tubercles along the forearm separate 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. chamaeleo
. The presence of an externally evident mental gland separates M

ETYMOLOGY: The species name 
<tp:taxon-name>neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is an adjective derived from the mountain name 
Neblina
plus the Latin suffix 
-aria
(fem. to agree with 
–hyla
of genus name), denoting a place or a connection to a place.

            <p>
COMPARISON WITH OTHER SPECIES: 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
but differs in having: hand and toe discs without sagittal black lines (present in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
); larvae with dorsal and ventral tail fins reaching the base of the tail (extending only a third in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
); larvae with scattered submarginal papillae in the upper and lower labium (apparently absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
); and larval oral disc with a single row of marginal papillae (three rows in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
). Furthermore, the advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is composed of a single note with 7–9 pulses and a duration of 295–382 ms; in contrast, the advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
is composed of two notes, one of 6 pulses and a duration of 90 ms, and the other with 7 pulses and a duration of 80 ms (Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
in its larger SVL (
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
47.7– 52.0 mm; 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>42–45 mm
; 
Rivero, 1961
; “ 
1971
” [1972]), and in having a single nuptial pad (two in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
). From 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
it differs in having a single nuptial pad, instead of two (Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]: 130); larger SVL (
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
, 
43.6–46.6 mm
; 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
47.7–52.0 mm); tadpole with dorsoventrally flattened body (globular in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
) and more rows of labial teeth (LTRF 10-13/ 
14-18 in<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
). 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
by its larger SVL (males: 37.0– 
37.8 mm
, ẍ= 37.4, 
n
= 5; females: 46.3–48.0 mm, ẍ= 47.05, 
n

<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), more developed prepollex (proportionally reduced in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), more extensive and thick nuptial pad (reduced to the dorsal margin of the prepollex, and composed of a thin layer of glandular tissue, apparently without colored epidermal projections), unpigmented eggs (completely pigmented in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), color pattern, tadpole with dorsoventrally flattened body (depressed in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>

COLORATION IN OF 
HOLOTYPE
IN PRESERVATIVE: Dorsally brown, turning darker brown toward the flanks, and with many large, irregular tan blotches; these blotches are smaller on the sides. Thick dark brown to black uniform line from tip of the snout to approximately the distal tip of urostyle. Dark, poorly defined, diffuse canthal stripe. Discs dorsally dark gray, contrasting with the brown coloration of the limbs. Hind limbs dorsally and ventrally brown; each thigh with five tan dorsal longitudinal stripes with diffuse margins that extend into the hidden areas. Shank with irregular tan blotches, some of which look dorsally continuous with those on thigh, smaller blotches on the outer surface of the foot. The only pattern present on rear surfaces of thighs are the posterior margins of the tan bars. A few tan blotches surround the cloacal region. Paracloacal tubercles tan. Ventral surfaces of body and limbs brown; subarticular, palmar, and thenar tubercles light gray. Irregular series of small tan blotches across abdomen below the pectoral region.

holotype
as a subtle dermal ridge along the tarsus is equally subtle in most 
paratypes
, with the exception of three females (
AMNHA-131172
, 
USNM 562070
and 562072), where it is quite distinct, and proximally forms a few flat tubercles.
</p>
            <p>
Most notable variation involves the coloration and color pattern, particularly regarding presence and extent of blotches (figs. 15, 19–20). We describe the variation according to the camps at which specimens were collected. Unless otherwise stated, all descriptions refer to preserved specimens. 
Camp I.
The single specimen collected at Camp I (USNM 562070), an adult female, has a barely defined dorsal pattern, being light tan with a diffuse darker reticulum. Exposed surfaces of shank and foot are light tan as well, with diffuse brown blotches. Thighs dark brown with light tan blotches. Undersides of hind limbs and forelimbs reddish brown. Abdomen and throat creamy; areas surrounding the insertion of the arms dark brown. Diffuse line borders the lower jaw. An irregular brown line extends from the mandibular symphysis up to the beginning of the pectoral region. 
Camp VII.
Coloration of two females differs notably from the 
holotype
. USNM 562072 is dorsally tan, becoming brown on the sides. It lacks the dorsal line and other discernible pattern, with the exception of some irregular, small, tan blotches on the sides. Coloration of this frog during the day was noted by Cocroft (field notes, 
Dec. 2, 1985
) as: iris coppery yellow with black reticulations; dorsal surfaces of fore- and hind limbs tan; dorsum from snout to vent brownish tan, fading to lighter tan laterally in center of body; feet mottled light tan and dark brown dorsally, toe pads dorsally dark brown, almost black in center outlined with light tan, brownish gray ventrally; sides and ventral surfaces lavender brown mottled with light tan; anterior and posterior thighs same as sides; toe webbing dark brown; light tan upper lips; tympanum coppery brown. In AMNH A-123715 the dorsal pattern is reversed with respect to the 
holotype
, with the ground coloration being tan and the blotches, which are smaller and fewer, being brown. Middorsal dorsal dark line present. Seven longitudinal bars on the thighs. In his field notes Myers described this specimen in life as “Brown with vague darker blotching and blackish brown vertebral line. Flanks and thigh mottled and banded tan and purplish brown. Ventral surfaces purplish brown with suffusion of tan across chest. Iris golden yellow with black reticulation (conspicuous but not sharply defined).” 
Camp XI.
Nine of the 
10 specimens
collected in Camp XI have the dark vertebral line. With the exception of USNM 562079, all are like the 
holotype
in the dark brown flanks with tan blotches of variable size. Most variation involves the dorsal and thigh pattern, and the hues of brown and tan. On specimens USNM 562073– 74, USNM 562076, and USNM 562079–80, the dorsal pattern is barely distinguishable. USNM 562075 is completely light tan without dorsal blotches. Specimens USNM 562077–78 and USNM 562081–82 have dorsal blotches, but their pattern is reversed from that of the 
holotype
, with their ground coloration being tan or light tan and the blotches brown.

REMARKS: The presence of a mental gland is not externally evident in male 
paratypes
of Myersiohyla neblinaria
</tp:taxon-name>
, but is evident under high power magnification (60×) or through dissections. Superficial dissections in male USNM 562074 reveal a roughly circular patch of glandular tissue in the dermis of the mental region (fig. 21). A dissection of female USNM 562072 did not indicate the presence of a mental gland.
</p>
            <p>
The vocal sac appears to be single and subgular, as indicated by the slightly distended sacs of USNM 562073, USNM 562076–77, and USNM 562080. The forearm is robust and prominent in all males, and proportionally slender in females. The prepollex is equally enlarged in males and females (figs. 17, 22). Two specimens partially dissected when tissue samples were 
<tp:material-citation>
removed (
USNM 562072♀
, and 
USNM 562077</tp:material-citation>♂
) show a translucent peritoneum and unpigmented urinary bladder. The female (SVL 60.2 mm) has large, unpigmented ovarian eggs. The dissected right ovary (left one not dissected) contained 
119 eggs
with largest diameter of 2.7– 
2.9 mm
(ẍ= 2.8; s = 0.08; 
n
= 15). The male has elongated, almost cylindrical, unpigmented testes. Females are proportionally larger than males (SVL 54.0– 
61.6 mm
, males 
47.7–52.3 mm
). Superficial dissections in male USNM 562074 reveal that the m. intermandibularis has a large diamond-shaped aponeurosis; its fibers barely contact the oval and araphic m. submentalis. Supplementary elements of the m. intermandibularis absent. The m. depressor mandibulae originates from the zygomatic ramus of the squamosal, and, contiguously, from the posterior margin of the tympanic annuli; the tympanic fibers are not differentiated as a slip. There are no fibers originating from the dorsal fascia at the level of the m. levator scapulae.

ECOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY: Near Camp I, Buck found an adult female (USNM 562070) asleep during the day in a leaf axil of 
<tp:taxon-name>Bonnetia maguireorum</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Theaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) on a small ridge northeast of Camp I (fig. 23). At Camp VII, a gravid female (USNM 562072) was collected on a vine in the forest and produced copious amounts of a milky white exudate on its back after capture. Specimens from Camp XI were collected by McDiarmid, Cocroft, and Paolillo along a small (
1–4 m
wide) forest stream with large boulders and cascades. On 
February 25, 1985
, USNM 562073 was recorded as it called beside a cascade in a clump of grass growing out of a sloping, mossy rock face about 
1 m
from the water; three other males (USNM 562074, USNM 562077–78) were on leaves and in grass clumps near cascades on sloping rocks along the same stream. USNM 562075– 76, USNM 562079–80, USNM 562082 were all collected from a rocky grotto along the same stream on the following night. An immature male (see below) was collected on a leaf of a small plant about 
15 m
from the stream that same night.
</p>
            <p>
Two of three females (USNM 562070, SVL 59.8; USNM 562072, SVL 60.2) collected on 
February 10, 1984
, and 
February 10, 1985
, respectively, were gravid. A comparable-sized female (AMNH A-123715, SVL 
61.6 mm
) collected on 
November 29, 1984
also was gravid. The fourth female (AMNH A-131172), collected 
February 9–11, 1984
, was smaller (SVL 54.0 mm) and had oocytes in very early stages of development, suggesting that she was approaching maturity. Most collected males (SVL 
47.7–52.3 mm
, 
n
= 10) had well-developed nuptial pads and presumably were capable of breeding. Calling males were heard in late 
February 1985
at Camp XI. A single smaller male (USNM 562081, SVL 40.0 mm) collected at the same time and place lacked nuptial pads and likely was immature.

            <p>
VOCALIZATION: The advertisement call of a male 
paratype
(USNM 562073) calling alone was recorded in February along a cascading stream near Camp XI (fig. 24). The frog was calling at the base of a clump of grass, about 
1 m
from the water. The recording includes 31 notes being continuously given in 80 sec of tape (the recording may contain only the terminal part of a long call).

            <p>
The call is a long train of well-spaced notes given at a rate of 23.4 notes/min. Note duration is about 0.3–0.4 sec (295–382 ms, ẍ = 338 ± 21 ms, 
n
= 20). The individual note is composed of 7–9 pulses (ẍ = 8.05 ± 0.69, 
n
= 20 notes) that are resolvable even by narrowband analysis (fig. 24C). The individual note is a brief musical trill, being narrowly tuned with frequency rising about 113–151 Hz throughout the note from 1522–1560 Hz at initiation to 1673 Hz at the end (
n
= 9 notes analyzed).
</p>
            <p>
Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) described the advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
as a train of 240 ms, composed of two notes, the first with six pulses (90 ms) and the second with seven pulses (70 ms). The call was described as spanning the spectrum between 1200–2000 Hz, with a harmonic at 4400 Hz and the fundamental frequency at 1740 Hz. The call repetition rate was 20 notes/min. While no illustrations or temperature data were provided by Ayarzagüena and Señaris, their description suggests a call quite different from that of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Although 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
are readily diagnosable by several morphological characters (see diagnosis), the calls seem similar. The call of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
was described by Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]), on the basis of recordings done at 19° C. The call was composed of single notes with an average duration of 420 ms, with 10–11 wellspaced pulses, a dominant frequency of 2000 Hz, and a bandwidth between 1250 and 2600 Hz. The note repetition rate was 44 notes/min.

TADPOLE: The uncorrected pairwise distances of 16S sequences (table 2), between the tadpole (USNM 562732) and those of the 
holotype
, and 
paratypes
(USNM 562072, USNM 562074) are 0%–0.2%. Conversely, they are 12.3%–13.6% different from the sequences of available specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
. Considering the identical or almost identical sequences, we consider this tadpole and all others with the same general morphology (see below) to be larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Five larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
in stage 25 were taken in the stream below Camp IX. They were found among rocks in shallow water (~ 
5 cm
deep) in slow-moving portions of the stream by day and night. A few tadpoles presumed to be of the same species (greenish gray) were seen at Camp VII (Cocroft, field notes) but none were collected. Specimens from Camp XI are quite fragile (possibly because of problems with the formalin [low pH?] at the time of fixation), especially the largest individual (USNM 562370) that was illustrated shortly after its capture and shown in figure 25. Since that time, the specimen has progressively deteriorated, particularly in that its tooth rows are separating from the tooth ridges; otherwise the remainder of the specimen is in good condition. Based on notes on the LTRF taken when the specimen was illustrated and additional observations, we describe it below and compare it with other available specimens.
</p>
            <p>Description:
A tadpole (USNM 562370, fig. 25) in stage 25 from Camp XI has the following measurements (all in mm): total length 76.0; body length 27.0; basal tail muscle height 7.8; basal tail muscle width 7.8; maximum dorsal fin height 2.8, this point being 
20 mm
away from body; maximum ventral fin height 2.8, this point being 
24.4 mm
away from body; body width 16.7; body depth 12.1; eye diameter 2.0; pupil diameter 0.8; interorbital distance 5.0; internarial distance 4.9; snout to nostril distance 6.5; snout to eye 2.5; snout to spiracle 21.7; oral disc diameter 14.9.
</p>
            <p>Oral disc enlarged and ventral; marginal papillae in single row, with contiguous papillae in offset disposition, but sometimes also forming second row. Few submarginal papillae scattered between distal labial tooth rows and labial edge. LTRF 16(16)/21(1). Gaps in rows A-16 and P-1 small, of about equal width. Teeth on proximal (closest to mouth) rows wider than teeth on distal rows; distal teeth 2–3 times more numerous per mm. Tooth density on P-1 about 35 teeth/mm. Upper jaw sheath long and slender, with uniform and small serrations. Lower jaw sheath wide, V- shaped, about four times as wide as upper jaw sheath, and with low, rounded serrations.</p>
            <p>Body dorsoventrally flattened anteriorly, ovoid posteriorly. Eyes small, dorsolateral. Snout slightly truncated in dorsal view, gently slopping in profile. Nostrils relatively small (about 60% of eye diameter), with fleshy rim and two medial, contiguous, triangular projections, anterior one quite prominent and about twice as large as the posterior one. Spiracle lateral, sinistral, its inner wall fused with body wall along its distal half; opening oriented slightly dorsally. Vent tube dextral, twice as long as wide, fused with lower fin; angular aperture. Dorsal fin originating on terminal eighth of the body, anterior to origin of tail; lower fin originating at base of tail. Neuromasts not visible but presumably present and undetected because of the almost complete loss of pigmentation as an artifact of fixation. Melanophores also not visible but presumably present (see below).</p>
            <p>
Some variation was observed in comparing the described specimen (USNM 562370) with four other smaller specimens also in stage 25 (USNM 562731: TTL 
48 mm
, LTRF 14/15; USNM 567732: TTL? [tail taken for tissue], LTRF 14/18; USNM 562731[2]: TTL 41 and 
22 mm
, LTRF 13/15 and 9/10, respectively). We did not observe the second, minor triangular projection from the nostril rim in these specimens. Further studies will determine whether these projections are the same structures noticed by 
Mijares-Urrutia (1992)
and 
Sanchez (2010)
on several species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
. Coloration of the body of USNM 567732 (a tissue voucher that was frozen in the field in liquid nitrogen) when it was thawed and preserved (Sept., 2005) was overall greenish with extensive concentrations of pigment on the head and body and patches of iridophores above the eyes; scattered patches of greenish color on the snout; neuromasts not visible and perhaps absent; melanophores (not visible in the other field-fixed specimens) visible and rodlike.
</p>
            <p>
The LTRF of 16/21 reported for the largest tadpole (fig. 25) represents the largest labial toothrow formula known; it was erroneously reported as 17/21 and the largest value in hylids by 
Altig and McDiarmid (1999b: 308)
. The only tadpoles having large formulae that are close to the one reported here are those of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
(a maximum of 14/21), 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
(a maximum of 13/18), and the 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus armatus</tp:taxon-name>
group (a maximum of 14/17, 
Cadle and Altig, 1991
; 
Lotters et al., 2005
). Interestingly, the smaller tadpoles of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
also have smaller formulae (ranging from 9/10 to 14/18). This apparent positive association between increased total length and LTRF could be related to a similar observation recently reported by 
Sanchez (2010)
in tadpoles of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
; however, the underlying mechanism of ontogenetic increase in the number of labial tooth rows requires further study.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER SPECIES: 
Myersiohyla loveridgei
is most similar to 
M. aromatica
, from which it apparently differs by the presence of a distinct tarsal ridge (absent in 
M. aromatica
; Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). The presence of two nuptial pads differentiates 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. inparquesi
, 
M. kanaima
, and 
M. neblinaria
. Dorsal color pattern and the presence of a row of tubercles along the forearm separate 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. chamaeleo
. The presence of an externally evident mental gland separates M
</tp:taxon-name>

DESCRIPTION: The descriptions provided by 
Rivero (1961
, “ 
1971
” [1972]) are adequate, but a few details are worth noting. 
Rivero (1961)
described the nuptial pad of the 
holotype
as “male with a brown rugosity on the pollex and inner finger....” Later Rivero (“1971” [1972]) described the second specimen (UPRM. 2854) as having “a smooth nuptial excrescence that extends up to the second finger.” We had access only to the 
holotype
MCZ 28565, an adult male (fig. 26). Like 

M. 
aromatica
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
, it shows two contiguous, discrete nuptial pads covered with minute epidermal projections. One of the pads is on the prepollex, and the other is on the medial-proximal surface of the first digit (

). The presence of a mental gland that occupies most of the gular region (fig. 28) is another characteristic overlooked by Rivero. 
Rivero (1961)
reported that the 
holotype
has the “vomerine odontoids forming a /--\ figure.” Our study of the same specimen suggests that the expression used by Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]), “slightly S- shaped” is quite appropriate to describe the disposition of each vomerine tooth series. There are 12 teeth on the right and 13 on the left. 
Rivero (1961)
described a slight tarsal fold in the 
holotype
; we consider it more appropriate to describe it as a distinct tarsal ridge. Foot-webbing formula for the 
holotype
is

Rivero (1961)
reported the SVL of the same specimen to be 42.0 mm.

REMARKS: The former 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
as described by 
Rivero (1961)
was based on a single male specimen from Cerro Duida, and that description was supplemented (Rivero, “1971” [1972]) with an additional male (SVL reported as 
45 mm
) from the same locality. Since its description, the species has rarely been mentioned in the literature (see 
Rivero, 1963
; 
La Marca and Smith, 1982
). While we still do not know any morphological synapomorphy for 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, we find 
<tp:taxon-name>loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
to be very close morphologically (if not a senior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
, see below) to various species included in 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, and for this reason we pose the testable hypothesis that 
<tp:taxon-name>loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
is congeneric. As morphological synapomorphies are discovered for 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, or tissues of 
<tp:taxon-name>loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
become available, its generic status should be reevaluated.
</p>
            <p>
We did not study specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
. Based solely on the thorough description provided by Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]), the only character states differentiating this species from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
seem to be the presence of a distinct tarsal ridge in the latter (Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). Since the distinctiveness of this ridge as described earlier in this paper is variable in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
, the diagnostic value of the character is tentative and needs further evaluation. Furthermore, Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) reported 30–34 total vomerine teeth, whereas the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
has 25. However, the lack of other specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
and potential variation in vomerine tooth counts precludes any conclusion regarding the diagnostic value of vomerine tooth number. Given that the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
(“Pico Culebra, Mt. Duida, 
3000 ft.
, Territorio 
Amazonas
”) is approximately 
40 km
(straight line) from the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
(“Cumbre del Tepui Huachamacari, Estado 
Amazonas
, 
Venezuela
”), and that Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) did not compare the species, we tentatively consider both species as valid, but suggest that their status deserves further study.

The second author collected an adult female specimen (USNM 550357) of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
on the summit of Cerro Duida (
1850 m
, 
03°25′N
, 
065°40′W
). The point of capture is approximately 
25 km
SE (straight line) from Cerro Culebra, the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
. The specimen has differences in pattern with the two specimens described by 
Rivero (1961
; “ 
1971
” [1972]) and subtle morphological differences; for these reasons we are hesitant to assign it to 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
until more data on the variation of this species becomes available. The specimen (fig. 29) differs from the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
and the specimen described by Rivero (“1971” [1972]) in having the thighs with irregular tan spots, instead of welldefined vertical bars, and in having the tympanic annuli more inclined medially. Some measurements of this specimen are (all in mm): SVL 47.2; HL 18.0; HW 17.4; IND 3.7; IO 6.0; ED 5.3; EN 4.5; TD 2.5; TL 26.4; FL 20.1. Other morphological characteristics include a row of tubercles along the arm, quite prominent palmar and plantar tubercles (including an enlarged inner metacarpal tubercle; see fig. 30), a well-developed ridge along the tarsus, and foot webbing formula

. Dorsally the background coloration is dark reddish brown, with multiple, irregular tan mottling. The discs are pale gray. A superficial dissection reveals a group of fibers of the m. depressor mandibulae that originates on the sheath of connective tissue that extends from the dorsal fascia into the space between the head and the body, with a few fibers originating at the level of the suprascapulae. This morphology is different from that seen in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
, as in that species the fibers originating at the level of the suprascapula form a distinct fan over the suprascapulae, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
sp, most of the fibers originate in the connective tissue between head and body, with only the proximal part of approximately half of the fibers marginally reposing on the levator scapulae. The specimen is a gravid female. The dissected right ovary (left one intact) contained 
47 eggs
with largest diameters of 2.5–3.0 mm ẍ = 2.73; s = 0.15; 
n
= 15), mostly unpigmented, with the exception of a reduced, pale brown animal pole.

Orejas-Miranda and Quesada (1976) referred to an unidentified hylid from the summit of Cerro Jaua and also mentioned tadpoles with numerous labial tooth rows. Further, they published a black-and-white photograph (their fig. 6) of an adult frog that unequivocally looks like a 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
. An adult male of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
and some tadpoles with large LTRFs from Jaua are housed in the USNM (USNM 561349) and will be dealt with in a separate contribution.

            <p>MacCulloch and Lathrop (2005)
reported on 
23 specimens
of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
collected on Mount Ayanganna, 
Guyana
. The authors reported that “enlarged black-and-white eggs, 
1 mm
in diameter, were present in 13 of the 
17 females
; the remainder had small white ova.” However, our dissection of female USNM 549311 (SVL 
46.4 mm
.) revealed 
19 eggs
in the left ovary (largest diameter 2.9–3.2, ẍ = 3.07, s = 0.12); these eggs are densely pigmented overall, and the animal and vegetal poles are not distinguishable. This observation is more in line with 
Duellman and Hoogmoed’s (1992)
report for three female 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
, which had “relatively large (
1.8 mm
diameter) ... pigmented oviducal eggs.” Differences in egg size and coloration seem most likely to reflect state of maturity.
</p>
            <p>MacCulloch and Lathrop (2005)
further described a series of tadpoles that they assigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
on the basis of the presence of two subadults and two recently metamorphosed individuals (stage 45) on the bank of the stream, plus one metamorph (stage 43) collected along with the other tadpoles. These tadpoles differ from those of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
most notably in having an oral disc with a 2/4 LTRF.
</p>
            <p>
On the basis of the taxonomic distribution of LTRFs in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cophomantini, 
Faivovich et al. (2005)</tp:taxon-name>
suggested that an increase in the number of labial tooth rows is likely a putative synapomorphy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
, because all known larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
at that time had a minimum of 6/7 labial tooth rows. They stressed, however, that the minimum number of labial tooth rows that would be a synapomorphy was ambiguous because the tadpole of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
was unknown at that time.
</p>
            <p>
Taking into account the position of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
in our phylogenetic hypothesis, nested within a group where the minimum known labial toothrow formula is 6/7, a 2/4 LTRF is a stark contrast. This could well be simply another case of homoplasy, and as such it should be considered until new evidence is gathered. The possibility of a mistaken association between subadults, juveniles and metamorphs that led to the identification of these tadpoles should also remain open to question.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER SPECIES: 
Myersiohyla loveridgei
is most similar to 
M. aromatica
, from which it apparently differs by the presence of a distinct tarsal ridge (absent in 
M. aromatica
; Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). The presence of two nuptial pads differentiates 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. inparquesi
, 
M. kanaima
, and 
M. neblinaria
. Dorsal color pattern and the presence of a row of tubercles along the forearm separate 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. chamaeleo
. The presence of an externally evident mental gland separates M

ETYMOLOGY: The species name 
<tp:taxon-name>neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is an adjective derived from the mountain name 
Neblina
plus the Latin suffix 
-aria
(fem. to agree with 
–hyla
of genus name), denoting a place or a connection to a place.

DIAGNOSIS: 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by: (1) SVL of male 47.7–52.3; female SVL 54.0–61.6; (2) a single, thick, nuptial pad; (3) a row of tubercles in the forearm; (4) mental gland present but evident only through dissection; (5) thighs with longitudinal bars; (6) dorsum brown, with variable presence of a dorsal line and blotches; (7) m. depressor mandibulae without an origin on the dorsal fascia at the level of the m. levator scapulae; (8) unpigmented eggs; (9) tadpoles with a dorsoventrally flattened body; (10) fins reaching the base of the tail; (11) labial toothrow formula (LTRF) 16 (16)/21(1).
</p>
            <p>
COMPARISON WITH OTHER SPECIES: 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
but differs in having: hand and toe discs without sagittal black lines (present in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
); larvae with dorsal and ventral tail fins reaching the base of the tail (extending only a third in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
); larvae with scattered submarginal papillae in the upper and lower labium (apparently absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
); and larval oral disc with a single row of marginal papillae (three rows in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
). Furthermore, the advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is composed of a single note with 7–9 pulses and a duration of 295–382 ms; in contrast, the advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
is composed of two notes, one of 6 pulses and a duration of 90 ms, and the other with 7 pulses and a duration of 80 ms (Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
in its larger SVL (
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
47.7– 52.0 mm; 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>42–45 mm
; 
Rivero, 1961
; “ 
1971
” [1972]), and in having a single nuptial pad (two in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
). From 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
it differs in having a single nuptial pad, instead of two (Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]: 130); larger SVL (
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
, 
43.6–46.6 mm
; 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
47.7–52.0 mm); tadpole with dorsoventrally flattened body (globular in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
) and more rows of labial teeth (LTRF 10-13/ 
14-18 in<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
). 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
by its larger SVL (males: 37.0– 
37.8 mm
, ẍ= 37.4, 
n
= 5; females: 46.3–48.0 mm, ẍ= 47.05, 
n
= 4; 
Goin and Woodley, 1969
, and this paper), more robust body (slender in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), more developed prepollex (proportionally reduced in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), more extensive and thick nuptial pad (reduced to the dorsal margin of the prepollex, and composed of a thin layer of glandular tissue, apparently without colored epidermal projections), unpigmented eggs (completely pigmented in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), color pattern, tadpole with dorsoventrally flattened body (depressed in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
) and more rows of labial teeth (LTRF 2/ 
4 in<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
, but see discussion).

COLORATION IN OF 
HOLOTYPE
IN PRESERVATIVE: Dorsally brown, turning darker brown toward the flanks, and with many large, irregular tan blotches; these blotches are smaller on the sides. Thick dark brown to black uniform line from tip of the snout to approximately the distal tip of urostyle. Dark, poorly defined, diffuse canthal stripe. Discs dorsally dark gray, contrasting with the brown coloration of the limbs. Hind limbs dorsally and ventrally brown; each thigh with five tan dorsal longitudinal stripes with diffuse margins that extend into the hidden areas. Shank with irregular tan blotches, some of which look dorsally continuous with those on thigh, smaller blotches on the outer surface of the foot. The only pattern present on rear surfaces of thighs are the posterior margins of the tan bars. A few tan blotches surround the cloacal region. Paracloacal tubercles tan. Ventral surfaces of body and limbs brown; subarticular, palmar, and thenar tubercles light gray. Irregular series of small tan blotches across abdomen below the pectoral region.

. Vomerine teeth (
n =

holotype
as a subtle dermal ridge along the tarsus is equally subtle in most 
paratypes
, with the exception of three females (
AMNHA-131172
, 
USNM 562070
and 562072), where it is quite distinct, and proximally forms a few flat tubercles.
</p>
            <p>
Most notable variation involves the coloration and color pattern, particularly regarding presence and extent of blotches (figs. 15, 19–20). We describe the variation according to the camps at which specimens were collected. Unless otherwise stated, all descriptions refer to preserved specimens. 
Camp I.
The single specimen collected at Camp I (USNM 562070), an adult female, has a barely defined dorsal pattern, being light tan with a diffuse darker reticulum. Exposed surfaces of shank and foot are light tan as well, with diffuse brown blotches. Thighs dark brown with light tan blotches. Undersides of hind limbs and forelimbs reddish brown. Abdomen and throat creamy; areas surrounding the insertion of the arms dark brown. Diffuse line borders the lower jaw. An irregular brown line extends from the mandibular symphysis up to the beginning of the pectoral region. 
Camp VII.
Coloration of two females differs notably from the 
holotype
. USNM 562072 is dorsally tan, becoming brown on the sides. It lacks the dorsal line and other discernible pattern, with the exception of some irregular, small, tan blotches on the sides. Coloration of this frog during the day was noted by Cocroft (field notes, 
Dec. 2, 1985
) as: iris coppery yellow with black reticulations; dorsal surfaces of fore- and hind limbs tan; dorsum from snout to vent brownish tan, fading to lighter tan laterally in center of body; feet mottled light tan and dark brown dorsally, toe pads dorsally dark brown, almost black in center outlined with light tan, brownish gray ventrally; sides and ventral surfaces lavender brown mottled with light tan; anterior and posterior thighs same as sides; toe webbing dark brown; light tan upper lips; tympanum coppery brown. In AMNH A-123715 the dorsal pattern is reversed with respect to the 
holotype
, with the ground coloration being tan and the blotches, which are smaller and fewer, being brown. Middorsal dorsal dark line present. Seven longitudinal bars on the thighs. In his field notes Myers described this specimen in life as “Brown with vague darker blotching and blackish brown vertebral line. Flanks and thigh mottled and banded tan and purplish brown. Ventral surfaces purplish brown with suffusion of tan across chest. Iris golden yellow with black reticulation (conspicuous but not sharply defined).” 
Camp XI.
Nine of the 
10 specimens
collected in Camp XI have the dark vertebral line. With the exception of USNM 562079, all are like the 
holotype
in the dark brown flanks with tan blotches of variable size. Most variation involves the dorsal and thigh pattern, and the hues of brown and tan. On specimens USNM 562073– 74, USNM 562076, and USNM 562079–80, the dorsal pattern is barely distinguishable. USNM 562075 is completely light tan without dorsal blotches. Specimens USNM 562077–78 and USNM 562081–82 have dorsal blotches, but their pattern is reversed from that of the 
holotype
, with their ground coloration being tan or light tan and the blotches brown.

REMARKS: The presence of a mental gland is not externally evident in male 
paratypes
of Myersiohyla neblinaria
</tp:taxon-name>
, but is evident under high power magnification (60×) or through dissections. Superficial dissections in male USNM 562074 reveal a roughly circular patch of glandular tissue in the dermis of the mental region (fig. 21). A dissection of female USNM 562072 did not indicate the presence of a mental gland.
</p>
            <p>
The vocal sac appears to be single and subgular, as indicated by the slightly distended sacs of USNM 562073, USNM 562076–77, and USNM 562080. The forearm is robust and prominent in all males, and proportionally slender in females. The prepollex is equally enlarged in males and females (figs. 17, 22). Two specimens partially dissected when tissue samples were 
<tp:material-citation>
removed (
USNM 562072♀
, and 
USNM 562077</tp:material-citation>♂
) show a translucent peritoneum and unpigmented urinary bladder. The female (SVL 60.2 mm) has large, unpigmented ovarian eggs. The dissected right ovary (left one not dissected) contained 
119 eggs
with largest diameter of 2.7– 
2.9 mm
(ẍ= 2.8; s = 0.08; 
n
= 15). The male has elongated, almost cylindrical, unpigmented testes. Females are proportionally larger than males (SVL 54.0– 
61.6 mm
, males 
47.7–52.3 mm
). Superficial dissections in male USNM 562074 reveal that the m. intermandibularis has a large diamond-shaped aponeurosis; its fibers barely contact the oval and araphic m. submentalis. Supplementary elements of the m. intermandibularis absent. The m. depressor mandibulae originates from the zygomatic ramus of the squamosal, and, contiguously, from the posterior margin of the tympanic annuli; the tympanic fibers are not differentiated as a slip. There are no fibers originating from the dorsal fascia at the level of the m. levator scapulae.

ECOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY: Near Camp I, Buck found an adult female (USNM 562070) asleep during the day in a leaf axil of 
<tp:taxon-name>Bonnetia maguireorum</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Theaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) on a small ridge northeast of Camp I (fig. 23). At Camp VII, a gravid female (USNM 562072) was collected on a vine in the forest and produced copious amounts of a milky white exudate on its back after capture. Specimens from Camp XI were collected by McDiarmid, Cocroft, and Paolillo along a small (
1–4 m
wide) forest stream with large boulders and cascades. On 
February 25, 1985
, USNM 562073 was recorded as it called beside a cascade in a clump of grass growing out of a sloping, mossy rock face about 
1 m
from the water; three other males (USNM 562074, USNM 562077–78) were on leaves and in grass clumps near cascades on sloping rocks along the same stream. USNM 562075– 76, USNM 562079–80, USNM 562082 were all collected from a rocky grotto along the same stream on the following night. An immature male (see below) was collected on a leaf of a small plant about 
15 m
from the stream that same night.
</p>
            <p>
Two of three females (USNM 562070, SVL 59.8; USNM 562072, SVL 60.2) collected on 
February 10, 1984
, and 
February 10, 1985
, respectively, were gravid. A comparable-sized female (AMNH A-123715, SVL 
61.6 mm
) collected on 
November 29, 1984
also was gravid. The fourth female (AMNH A-131172), collected 
February 9–11, 1984
, was smaller (SVL 54.0 mm) and had oocytes in very early stages of development, suggesting that she was approaching maturity. Most collected males (SVL 
47.7–52.3 mm
, 
n
= 10) had well-developed nuptial pads and presumably were capable of breeding. Calling males were heard in late 
February 1985
at Camp XI. A single smaller male (USNM 562081, SVL 40.0 mm) collected at the same time and place lacked nuptial pads and likely was immature.

VOCALIZATION: The advertisement call of a male 
paratype
(USNM 562073) calling alone was recorded in February along a cascading stream near Camp XI (fig. 24). The frog was calling at the base of a clump of grass, about 
1 m
from the water. The recording includes 31 notes being continuously given in 80 sec of tape (the recording may contain only the terminal part of a long call).

The call is a long train of well-spaced notes given at a rate of 23.4 notes/min. Note duration is about 0.3–0.4 sec (295–382 ms, ẍ = 338 ± 21 ms, 
n
= 20). The individual note is composed of 7–9 pulses (ẍ = 8.05 ± 0.69, 
n
= 20 notes) that are resolvable even by narrowband analysis (fig. 24C). The individual note is a brief musical trill, being narrowly tuned with frequency rising about 113–151 Hz throughout the note from 1522–1560 Hz at initiation to 1673 Hz at the end (
n
= 9 notes analyzed).

            <p>
Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) described the advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
as a train of 240 ms, composed of two notes, the first with six pulses (90 ms) and the second with seven pulses (70 ms). The call was described as spanning the spectrum between 1200–2000 Hz, with a harmonic at 4400 Hz and the fundamental frequency at 1740 Hz. The call repetition rate was 20 notes/min. While no illustrations or temperature data were provided by Ayarzagüena and Señaris, their description suggests a call quite different from that of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Although 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
are readily diagnosable by several morphological characters (see diagnosis), the calls seem similar. The call of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
was described by Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]), on the basis of recordings done at 19° C. The call was composed of single notes with an average duration of 420 ms, with 10–11 wellspaced pulses, a dominant frequency of 2000 Hz, and a bandwidth between 1250 and 2600 Hz. The note repetition rate was 44 notes/min.

TADPOLE: The uncorrected pairwise distances of 16S sequences (table 2), between the tadpole (USNM 562732) and those of the

paratypes
(USNM 562072, USNM 562074) are 0%–0.2%. Conversely, they are 12.3%–13.6% different from the sequences of available specimens of

. Considering the identical or almost identical sequences, we consider this tadpole and all others with the same general morphology (see below) to be larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Five larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
in stage 25 were taken in the stream below Camp IX. They were found among rocks in shallow water (~ 
5 cm
deep) in slow-moving portions of the stream by day and night. A few tadpoles presumed to be of the same species (greenish gray) were seen at Camp VII (Cocroft, field notes) but none were collected. Specimens from Camp XI are quite fragile (possibly because of problems with the formalin [low pH?] at the time of fixation), especially the largest individual (USNM 562370) that was illustrated shortly after its capture and shown in figure 25. Since that time, the specimen has progressively deteriorated, particularly in that its tooth rows are separating from the tooth ridges; otherwise the remainder of the specimen is in good condition. Based on notes on the LTRF taken when the specimen was illustrated and additional observations, we describe it below and compare it with other available specimens.
</p>
            <p>Description:
A tadpole (USNM 562370, fig. 25) in stage 25 from Camp XI has the following measurements (all in mm): total length 76.0; body length 27.0; basal tail muscle height 7.8; basal tail muscle width 7.8; maximum dorsal fin height 2.8, this point being 
20 mm
away from body; maximum ventral fin height 2.8, this point being 
24.4 mm
away from body; body width 16.7; body depth 12.1; eye diameter 2.0; pupil diameter 0.8; interorbital distance 5.0; internarial distance 4.9; snout to nostril distance 6.5; snout to eye 2.5; snout to spiracle 21.7; oral disc diameter 14.9.
</p>
            <p>Oral disc enlarged and ventral; marginal papillae in single row, with contiguous papillae in offset disposition, but sometimes also forming second row. Few submarginal papillae scattered between distal labial tooth rows and labial edge. LTRF 16(16)/21(1). Gaps in rows A-16 and P-1 small, of about equal width. Teeth on proximal (closest to mouth) rows wider than teeth on distal rows; distal teeth 2–3 times more numerous per mm. Tooth density on P-1 about 35 teeth/mm. Upper jaw sheath long and slender, with uniform and small serrations. Lower jaw sheath wide, V- shaped, about four times as wide as upper jaw sheath, and with low, rounded serrations.</p>
            <p>Body dorsoventrally flattened anteriorly, ovoid posteriorly. Eyes small, dorsolateral. Snout slightly truncated in dorsal view, gently slopping in profile. Nostrils relatively small (about 60% of eye diameter), with fleshy rim and two medial, contiguous, triangular projections, anterior one quite prominent and about twice as large as the posterior one. Spiracle lateral, sinistral, its inner wall fused with body wall along its distal half; opening oriented slightly dorsally. Vent tube dextral, twice as long as wide, fused with lower fin; angular aperture. Dorsal fin originating on terminal eighth of the body, anterior to origin of tail; lower fin originating at base of tail. Neuromasts not visible but presumably present and undetected because of the almost complete loss of pigmentation as an artifact of fixation. Melanophores also not visible but presumably present (see below).</p>
            <p>
Some variation was observed in comparing the described specimen (USNM 562370) with four other smaller specimens also in stage 25 (USNM 562731: TTL 
48 mm
, LTRF 14/15; USNM 567732: TTL? [tail taken for tissue], LTRF 14/18; USNM 562731[2]: TTL 41 and 
22 mm
, LTRF 13/15 and 9/10, respectively). We did not observe the second, minor triangular projection from the nostril rim in these specimens. Further studies will determine whether these projections are the same structures noticed by 
Mijares-Urrutia (1992)
and 
Sanchez (2010)
on several species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
. Coloration of the body of USNM 567732 (a tissue voucher that was frozen in the field in liquid nitrogen) when it was thawed and preserved (Sept., 2005) was overall greenish with extensive concentrations of pigment on the head and body and patches of iridophores above the eyes; scattered patches of greenish color on the snout; neuromasts not visible and perhaps absent; melanophores (not visible in the other field-fixed specimens) visible and rodlike.
</p>
            <p>
The LTRF of 16/21 reported for the largest tadpole (fig. 25) represents the largest labial toothrow formula known; it was erroneously reported as 17/21 and the largest value in hylids by 
Altig and McDiarmid (1999b: 308)
. The only tadpoles having large formulae that are close to the one reported here are those of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
(a maximum of 14/21), 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
(a maximum of 13/18), and the 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus armatus</tp:taxon-name>
group (a maximum of 14/17, 
Cadle and Altig, 1991
; 
Lotters et al., 2005
). Interestingly, the smaller tadpoles of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
also have smaller formulae (ranging from 9/10 to 14/18). This apparent positive association between increased total length and LTRF could be related to a similar observation recently reported by 
Sanchez (2010)
in tadpoles of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
; however, the underlying mechanism of ontogenetic increase in the number of labial tooth rows requires further study.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER SPECIES: 
Myersiohyla loveridgei
is most similar to 
M. aromatica
, from which it apparently differs by the presence of a distinct tarsal ridge (absent in 
M. aromatica
; Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). The presence of two nuptial pads differentiates 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. inparquesi
,

DESCRIPTION: The descriptions provided by 
Rivero (1961
, “ 
1971
” [1972]) are adequate, but a few details are worth noting. 
Rivero (1961)
described the nuptial pad of the 
holotype
as “male with a brown rugosity on the pollex and inner finger....” Later Rivero (“1971” [1972]) described the second specimen (UPRM. 2854) as having “a smooth nuptial excrescence that extends up to the second finger.” We had access only to the 
holotype
MCZ 28565, an adult male (fig. 26). Like 

M. 
aromatica
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
, it shows two contiguous, discrete nuptial pads covered with minute epidermal projections. One of the pads is on the prepollex, and the other is on the medial-proximal surface of the first digit (

). The presence of a mental gland that occupies most of the gular region (fig. 28) is another characteristic overlooked by Rivero. 
Rivero (1961)
reported that the 
holotype
has the “vomerine odontoids forming a /--\ figure.” Our study of the same specimen suggests that the expression used by Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]), “slightly S- shaped” is quite appropriate to describe the disposition of each vomerine tooth series. There are 12 teeth on the right and 13 on the left. 
Rivero (1961)
described a slight tarsal fold in the 
holotype
; we consider it more appropriate to describe it as a distinct tarsal ridge. Foot-webbing formula for the 
holotype
is

(the specimen is quite contorted, all in mm) are: SVL 38.2; HL 14.1; HW 13.3; IND 3.1; IO 4.8; EN 3.7; ED 4.2; TD 2.1; TL 22.0; FL 16.4. Note that 
Rivero (1961)
reported the SVL of the same specimen to be 42.0 mm.

REMARKS: The former 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
as described by 
Rivero (1961)
was based on a single male specimen from Cerro Duida, and that description was supplemented (Rivero, “1971” [1972]) with an additional male (SVL reported as 
45 mm
) from the same locality. Since its description, the species has rarely been mentioned in the literature (see 
Rivero, 1963
; 
La Marca and Smith, 1982
). While we still do not know any morphological synapomorphy for 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, we find 
<tp:taxon-name>loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
to be very close morphologically (if not a senior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
, see below) to various species included in 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, and for this reason we pose the testable hypothesis that 
<tp:taxon-name>loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
is congeneric. As morphological synapomorphies are discovered for 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, or tissues of 
<tp:taxon-name>loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
become available, its generic status should be reevaluated.
</p>
            <p>
We did not study specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
. Based solely on the thorough description provided by Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]), the only character states differentiating this species from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
seem to be the presence of a distinct tarsal ridge in the latter (Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). Since the distinctiveness of this ridge as described earlier in this paper is variable in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
, the diagnostic value of the character is tentative and needs further evaluation. Furthermore, Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) reported 30–34 total vomerine teeth, whereas the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
has 25. However, the lack of other specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
and potential variation in vomerine tooth counts precludes any conclusion regarding the diagnostic value of vomerine tooth number. Given that the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
(“Pico Culebra, Mt. Duida, 
3000 ft.
, Territorio 
Amazonas
”) is approximately 
40 km
(straight line) from the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
(“Cumbre del Tepui Huachamacari, Estado 
Amazonas
, 
Venezuela
”), and that Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) did not compare the species, we tentatively consider both species as valid, but suggest that their status deserves further study.

ECOLOGY 
AND
NATURAL HISTORY: The 
holotype
was collected during the day “as it sprang from beneath (or near?) a rock in a treeless, rocky area of Mt. Duida” (
Rivero, 1961: 109
). 
The
other known specimen was collected on the mossy stones along a fast-running stream (

The second author collected an adult female specimen (USNM 550357) of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
on the summit of Cerro Duida (
1850 m
, 
03°25′N
, 
065°40′W
). The point of capture is approximately 
25 km
SE (straight line) from Cerro Culebra, the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
. The specimen has differences in pattern with the two specimens described by 
Rivero (1961
; “ 
1971
” [1972]) and subtle morphological differences; for these reasons we are hesitant to assign it to 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
until more data on the variation of this species becomes available. The specimen (fig. 29) differs from the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
and the specimen described by Rivero (“1971” [1972]) in having the thighs with irregular tan spots, instead of welldefined vertical bars, and in having the tympanic annuli more inclined medially. Some measurements of this specimen are (all in mm): SVL 47.2; HL 18.0; HW 17.4; IND 3.7; IO 6.0; ED 5.3; EN 4.5; TD 2.5; TL 26.4; FL 20.1. Other morphological characteristics include a row of tubercles along the arm, quite prominent palmar and plantar tubercles (including an enlarged inner metacarpal tubercle; see fig. 30), a well-developed ridge along the tarsus, and foot webbing formula

. Dorsally the background coloration is dark reddish brown, with multiple, irregular tan mottling. The discs are pale gray. A superficial dissection reveals a group of fibers of the m. depressor mandibulae that originates on the sheath of connective tissue that extends from the dorsal fascia into the space between the head and the body, with a few fibers originating at the level of the suprascapulae. This morphology is different from that seen in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
, as in that species the fibers originating at the level of the suprascapula form a distinct fan over the suprascapulae, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
sp, most of the fibers originate in the connective tissue between head and body, with only the proximal part of approximately half of the fibers marginally reposing on the levator scapulae. The specimen is a gravid female. The dissected right ovary (left one intact) contained 
47 eggs
with largest diameters of 2.5–3.0 mm ẍ = 2.73; s = 0.15; 
n
= 15), mostly unpigmented, with the exception of a reduced, pale brown animal pole.

Orejas-Miranda and Quesada (1976) referred to an unidentified hylid from the summit of Cerro Jaua and also mentioned tadpoles with numerous labial tooth rows. Further, they published a black-and-white photograph (their fig. 6) of an adult frog that unequivocally looks like a 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
. An adult male of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
and some tadpoles with large LTRFs from Jaua are housed in the USNM (USNM 561349) and will be dealt with in a separate contribution.

THE MONOPHYLY OF

            <p>
Although morphological synapomorphies are still unknown, 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
is recovered as monophyletic in the present phylogenetic analysis and supported with 91% parsimony jackknife absolute frequency in the static parsimony analysis. Besides the monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, the results of the analysis conducted need extensive discussion, but that requires a separate paper (Faivovich et al., in prep.), so we provide here some general comments that are expanded in appendix 1.

            <p>MacCulloch and Lathrop (2005)
reported on 
23 specimens
of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
collected on Mount Ayanganna, 
Guyana
. The authors reported that “enlarged black-and-white eggs, 
1 mm
in diameter, were present in 13 of the 
17 females
; the remainder had small white ova.” However, our dissection of female USNM 549311 (SVL 
46.4 mm
.) revealed 
19 eggs
in the left ovary (largest diameter 2.9–3.2, ẍ = 3.07, s = 0.12); these eggs are densely pigmented overall, and the animal and vegetal poles are not distinguishable. This observation is more in line with 
Duellman and Hoogmoed’s (1992)
report for three female 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
, which had “relatively large (
1.8 mm
diameter) ... pigmented oviducal eggs.” Differences in egg size and coloration seem most likely to reflect state of maturity.
</p>
            <p>MacCulloch and Lathrop (2005)
further described a series of tadpoles that they assigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
on the basis of the presence of two subadults and two recently metamorphosed individuals (stage 45) on the bank of the stream, plus one metamorph (stage 43) collected along with the other tadpoles. These tadpoles differ from those of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
most notably in having an oral disc with a 2/4 LTRF.
</p>
            <p>
On the basis of the taxonomic distribution of LTRFs in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cophomantini, 
Faivovich et al. (2005)</tp:taxon-name>
suggested that an increase in the number of labial tooth rows is likely a putative synapomorphy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
, because all known larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
at that time had a minimum of 6/7 labial tooth rows. They stressed, however, that the minimum number of labial tooth rows that would be a synapomorphy was ambiguous because the tadpole of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
was unknown at that time.
</p>
            <p>
Taking into account the position of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
in our phylogenetic hypothesis, nested within a group where the minimum known labial toothrow formula is 6/7, a 2/4 LTRF is a stark contrast. This could well be simply another case of homoplasy, and as such it should be considered until new evidence is gathered. The possibility of a mistaken association between subadults, juveniles and metamorphs that led to the identification of these tadpoles should also remain open to question.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER SPECIES: 
Myersiohyla loveridgei
is most similar to 
M. aromatica
, from which it apparently differs by the presence of a distinct tarsal ridge (absent in 
M. aromatica
; Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). The presence of two nuptial pads differentiates 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. inparquesi
, 
M. kanaima
, and 
M. neblinaria
. Dorsal color pattern and the presence of a row of tubercles along the forearm separate 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. chamaeleo
. The presence of an externally evident mental gland separates M

ETYMOLOGY: The species name 
<tp:taxon-name>neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is an adjective derived from the mountain name 
Neblina
plus the Latin suffix 
-aria
(fem. to agree with 
–hyla
of genus name), denoting a place or a connection to a place.

DIAGNOSIS: 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by: (1) SVL of male 47.7–52.3; female SVL 54.0–61.6; (2) a single, thick, nuptial pad; (3) a row of tubercles in the forearm; (4) mental gland present but evident only through dissection; (5) thighs with longitudinal bars; (6) dorsum brown, with variable presence of a dorsal line and blotches; (7) m. depressor mandibulae without an origin on the dorsal fascia at the level of the m. levator scapulae; (8) unpigmented eggs; (9) tadpoles with a dorsoventrally flattened body; (10) fins reaching the base of the tail; (11) labial toothrow formula (LTRF) 16 (16)/21(1).
</p>
            <p>
COMPARISON WITH OTHER SPECIES: 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
but differs in having: hand and toe discs without sagittal black lines (present in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
); larvae with dorsal and ventral tail fins reaching the base of the tail (extending only a third in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
); larvae with scattered submarginal papillae in the upper and lower labium (apparently absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
); and larval oral disc with a single row of marginal papillae (three rows in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
). Furthermore, the advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is composed of a single note with 7–9 pulses and a duration of 295–382 ms; in contrast, the advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
is composed of two notes, one of 6 pulses and a duration of 90 ms, and the other with 7 pulses and a duration of 80 ms (Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
in its larger SVL (
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
47.7– 52.0 mm; 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>42–45 mm
; 
Rivero, 1961
; “ 
1971
” [1972]), and in having a single nuptial pad (two in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
). From 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
it differs in having a single nuptial pad, instead of two (Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]: 130); larger SVL (
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
, 
43.6–46.6 mm
; 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
47.7–52.0 mm); tadpole with dorsoventrally flattened body (globular in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
) and more rows of labial teeth (LTRF 10-13/ 
14-18 in<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
). 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
by its larger SVL (males: 37.0– 
37.8 mm
, ẍ= 37.4, 
n
= 5; females: 46.3–48.0 mm, ẍ= 47.05, 
n
= 4; 
Goin and Woodley, 1969
, and this paper), more robust body (slender in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), more developed prepollex (proportionally reduced in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), more extensive and thick nuptial pad (reduced to the dorsal margin of the prepollex, and composed of a thin layer of glandular tissue, apparently without colored epidermal projections), unpigmented eggs (completely pigmented in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), color pattern, tadpole with dorsoventrally flattened body (depressed in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
) and more rows of labial teeth (LTRF 2/

COLORATION OF 
HOLOTYPE
in life: No field notes are available for the 
holotype
. Visible details from a color slide of RWM, here reproduced as figure 15A, differ little from the coloration in preservative.
</p>
            <p>
COLORATION IN OF 
HOLOTYPE
IN PRESERVATIVE: Dorsally brown, turning darker brown toward the flanks, and with many large, irregular tan blotches; these blotches are smaller on the sides. Thick dark brown to black uniform line from tip of the snout to approximately the distal tip of urostyle. Dark, poorly defined, diffuse canthal stripe. Discs dorsally dark gray, contrasting with the brown coloration of the limbs. Hind limbs dorsally and ventrally brown; each thigh with five tan dorsal longitudinal stripes with diffuse margins that extend into the hidden areas. Shank with irregular tan blotches, some of which look dorsally continuous with those on thigh, smaller blotches on the outer surface of the foot. The only pattern present on rear surfaces of thighs are the posterior margins of the tan bars. A few tan blotches surround the cloacal region. Paracloacal tubercles tan. Ventral surfaces of body and limbs brown; subarticular, palmar, and thenar tubercles light gray. Irregular series of small tan blotches across abdomen below the pectoral region.

            <p>
VARIATION

V
. Vomerine teeth (
n =
12): 12-17 (right, ẍ = 14.1) and 11-16 (left, ẍ = 13.4). The structure that has been described in the 
holotype
as a subtle dermal ridge along the tarsus is equally subtle in most 
paratypes
, with the exception of three females (
AMNHA-131172
, 
USNM 562070
and 562072), where it is quite distinct, and proximally forms a few flat tubercles.
</p>
            <p>
Most notable variation involves the coloration and color pattern, particularly regarding presence and extent of blotches (figs. 15, 19–20). We describe the variation according to the camps at which specimens were collected. Unless otherwise stated, all descriptions refer to preserved specimens. 
Camp I.
The single specimen collected at Camp I (USNM 562070), an adult female, has a barely defined dorsal pattern, being light tan with a diffuse darker reticulum. Exposed surfaces of shank and foot are light tan as well, with diffuse brown blotches. Thighs dark brown with light tan blotches. Undersides of hind limbs and forelimbs reddish brown. Abdomen and throat creamy; areas surrounding the insertion of the arms dark brown. Diffuse line borders the lower jaw. An irregular brown line extends from the mandibular symphysis up to the beginning of the pectoral region. 
Camp VII.
Coloration of two females differs notably from the 
holotype
. USNM 562072 is dorsally tan, becoming brown on the sides. It lacks the dorsal line and other discernible pattern, with the exception of some irregular, small, tan blotches on the sides. Coloration of this frog during the day was noted by Cocroft (field notes, 
Dec. 2, 1985
) as: iris coppery yellow with black reticulations; dorsal surfaces of fore- and hind limbs tan; dorsum from snout to vent brownish tan, fading to lighter tan laterally in center of body; feet mottled light tan and dark brown dorsally, toe pads dorsally dark brown, almost black in center outlined with light tan, brownish gray ventrally; sides and ventral surfaces lavender brown mottled with light tan; anterior and posterior thighs same as sides; toe webbing dark brown; light tan upper lips; tympanum coppery brown. In AMNH A-123715 the dorsal pattern is reversed with respect to the 
holotype
, with the ground coloration being tan and the blotches, which are smaller and fewer, being brown. Middorsal dorsal dark line present. Seven longitudinal bars on the thighs. In his field notes Myers described this specimen in life as “Brown with vague darker blotching and blackish brown vertebral line. Flanks and thigh mottled and banded tan and purplish brown. Ventral surfaces purplish brown with suffusion of tan across chest. Iris golden yellow with black reticulation (conspicuous but not sharply defined).” 
Camp XI.
Nine of the 
10 specimens
collected in Camp XI have the dark vertebral line. With the exception of USNM 562079, all are like the 
holotype
in the dark brown flanks with tan blotches of variable size. Most variation involves the dorsal and thigh pattern, and the hues of brown and tan. On specimens USNM 562073– 74, USNM 562076, and USNM 562079–80, the dorsal pattern is barely distinguishable. USNM 562075 is completely light tan without dorsal blotches. Specimens USNM 562077–78 and USNM 562081–82 have dorsal blotches, but their pattern is reversed from that of the 
holotype
, with their ground coloration being tan or light tan and the blotches brown.

REMARKS: The presence of a mental gland is not externally evident in male 
paratypes
of Myersiohyla neblinaria
</tp:taxon-name>
, but is evident under high power magnification (60×) or through dissections. Superficial dissections in male USNM 562074 reveal a roughly circular patch of glandular tissue in the dermis of the mental region (fig. 21). A dissection of female USNM 562072 did not indicate the presence of a mental gland.
</p>
            <p>
The vocal sac appears to be single and subgular, as indicated by the slightly distended sacs of USNM 562073, USNM 562076–77, and USNM 562080. The forearm is robust and prominent in all males, and proportionally slender in females. The prepollex is equally enlarged in males and females (figs. 17, 22). Two specimens partially dissected when tissue samples were 
<tp:material-citation>
removed (
USNM 562072♀
, and 
USNM 562077</tp:material-citation>♂
) show a translucent peritoneum and unpigmented urinary bladder. The female (SVL 60.2 mm) has large, unpigmented ovarian eggs. The dissected right ovary (left one not dissected) contained 
119 eggs
with largest diameter of 2.7– 
2.9 mm
(ẍ= 2.8; s = 0.08; 
n
= 15). The male has elongated, almost cylindrical, unpigmented testes. Females are proportionally larger than males (SVL 54.0– 
61.6 mm
, males 
47.7–52.3 mm
). Superficial dissections in male USNM 562074 reveal that the m. intermandibularis has a large diamond-shaped aponeurosis; its fibers barely contact the oval and araphic m. submentalis. Supplementary elements of the m. intermandibularis absent. The m. depressor mandibulae originates from the zygomatic ramus of the squamosal, and, contiguously, from the posterior margin of the tympanic annuli; the tympanic fibers are not differentiated as a slip. There are no fibers originating from the dorsal fascia at the level of the m. levator scapulae.

ECOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY: Near Camp I, Buck found an adult female (USNM 562070) asleep during the day in a leaf axil of 
<tp:taxon-name>Bonnetia maguireorum</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Theaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) on a small ridge northeast of Camp I (fig. 23). At Camp VII, a gravid female (USNM 562072) was collected on a vine in the forest and produced copious amounts of a milky white exudate on its back after capture. Specimens from Camp XI were collected by McDiarmid, Cocroft, and Paolillo along a small (
1–4 m
wide) forest stream with large boulders and cascades. On 
February 25, 1985
, USNM 562073 was recorded as it called beside a cascade in a clump of grass growing out of a sloping, mossy rock face about 
1 m
from the water; three other males (USNM 562074, USNM 562077–78) were on leaves and in grass clumps near cascades on sloping rocks along the same stream. USNM 562075– 76, USNM 562079–80, USNM 562082 were all collected from a rocky grotto along the same stream on the following night. An immature male (see below) was collected on a leaf of a small plant about 
15 m
from the stream that same night.
</p>
            <p>
Two of three females (USNM 562070, SVL 59.8; USNM 562072, SVL 60.2) collected on 
February 10, 1984
, and 
February 10, 1985
, respectively, were gravid. A comparable-sized female (AMNH A-123715, SVL 
61.6 mm
) collected on 
November 29, 1984
also was gravid. The fourth female (AMNH A-131172), collected 
February 9–11, 1984
, was smaller (SVL 54.0 mm) and had oocytes in very early stages of development, suggesting that she was approaching maturity. Most collected males (SVL 
47.7–52.3 mm
, 
n
= 10) had well-developed nuptial pads and presumably were capable of breeding. Calling males were heard in late 
February 1985
at Camp XI. A single smaller male (USNM 562081, SVL 40.0 mm) collected at the same time and place lacked nuptial pads and likely was immature.

VOCALIZATION: The advertisement call of a male 
paratype
(USNM 562073) calling alone was recorded in February along a cascading stream near Camp XI (fig. 24). The frog was calling at the base of a clump of grass, about 
1 m
from the water. The recording includes 31 notes being continuously given in 80 sec of tape (the recording may contain only the terminal part of a long call).

            <p>
The call is a long train of well-spaced notes given at a rate of 23.4 notes/min. Note duration is about 0.3–0.4 sec (295–382 ms, ẍ = 338 ± 21 ms, 
n
= 20). The individual note is composed of 7–9 pulses (ẍ = 8.05 ± 0.69, 
n
= 20 notes) that are resolvable even by narrowband analysis (fig. 24C). The individual note is a brief musical trill, being narrowly tuned with frequency rising about 113–151 Hz throughout the note from 1522–1560 Hz at initiation to 1673 Hz at the end (
n
= 9 notes analyzed).
</p>
            <p>
Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) described the advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
as a train of 240 ms, composed of two notes, the first with six pulses (90 ms) and the second with seven pulses (70 ms). The call was described as spanning the spectrum between 1200–2000 Hz, with a harmonic at 4400 Hz and the fundamental frequency at 1740 Hz. The call repetition rate was 20 notes/min. While no illustrations or temperature data were provided by Ayarzagüena and Señaris, their description suggests a call quite different from that of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Although 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
are readily diagnosable by several morphological characters (see diagnosis), the calls seem similar. The call of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
was described by Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]), on the basis of recordings done at 19° C. The call was composed of single notes with an average duration of 420 ms, with 10–11 wellspaced pulses, a dominant frequency of 2000 Hz, and a bandwidth between 1250 and 2600 Hz. The note repetition rate was 44 notes/min.

TADPOLE: The uncorrected pairwise distances of 16S sequences (table 2), between the tadpole (USNM 562732) and those of the 
holotype
, and 
paratypes
(USNM 562072, USNM 562074) are 0%–0.2%. Conversely, they are 12.3%–13.6% different from the sequences of available specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
. Considering the identical or almost identical sequences, we consider this tadpole and all others with the same general morphology (see below) to be larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Five larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
in stage 25 were taken in the stream below Camp IX. They were found among rocks in shallow water (~ 
5 cm
deep) in slow-moving portions of the stream by day and night. A few tadpoles presumed to be of the same species (greenish gray) were seen at Camp VII (Cocroft, field notes) but none were collected. Specimens from Camp XI are quite fragile (possibly because of problems with the formalin [low pH?] at the time of fixation), especially the largest individual (USNM 562370) that was illustrated shortly after its capture and shown in figure 25. Since that time, the specimen has progressively deteriorated, particularly in that its tooth rows are separating from the tooth ridges; otherwise the remainder of the specimen is in good condition. Based on notes on the LTRF taken when the specimen was illustrated and additional observations, we describe it below and compare it with other available specimens.
</p>
            <p>Description:
A tadpole (USNM 562370, fig. 25) in stage 25 from Camp XI has the following measurements (all in mm): total length 76.0; body length 27.0; basal tail muscle height 7.8; basal tail muscle width 7.8; maximum dorsal fin height 2.8, this point being 
20 mm
away from body; maximum ventral fin height 2.8, this point being 
24.4 mm
away from body; body width 16.7; body depth 12.1; eye diameter 2.0; pupil diameter 0.8; interorbital distance 5.0; internarial distance 4.9; snout to nostril distance 6.5; snout to eye 2.5; snout to spiracle 21.7; oral disc diameter 14.9.
</p>
            <p>Oral disc enlarged and ventral; marginal papillae in single row, with contiguous papillae in offset disposition, but sometimes also forming second row. Few submarginal papillae scattered between distal labial tooth rows and labial edge. LTRF 16(16)/21(1). Gaps in rows A-16 and P-1 small, of about equal width. Teeth on proximal (closest to mouth) rows wider than teeth on distal rows; distal teeth 2–3 times more numerous per mm. Tooth density on P-1 about 35 teeth/mm. Upper jaw sheath long and slender, with uniform and small serrations. Lower jaw sheath wide, V- shaped, about four times as wide as upper jaw sheath, and with low, rounded serrations.</p>
            <p>Body dorsoventrally flattened anteriorly, ovoid posteriorly. Eyes small, dorsolateral. Snout slightly truncated in dorsal view, gently slopping in profile. Nostrils relatively small (about 60% of eye diameter), with fleshy rim and two medial, contiguous, triangular projections, anterior one quite prominent and about twice as large as the posterior one. Spiracle lateral, sinistral, its inner wall fused with body wall along its distal half; opening oriented slightly dorsally. Vent tube dextral, twice as long as wide, fused with lower fin; angular aperture. Dorsal fin originating on terminal eighth of the body, anterior to origin of tail; lower fin originating at base of tail. Neuromasts not visible but presumably present and undetected because of the almost complete loss of pigmentation as an artifact of fixation. Melanophores also not visible but presumably present (see below).</p>
            <p>
Some variation was observed in comparing the described specimen (USNM 562370) with four other smaller specimens also in stage 25 (USNM 562731: TTL 
48 mm
, LTRF 14/15; USNM 567732: TTL? [tail taken for tissue], LTRF 14/18; USNM 562731[2]: TTL 41 and 
22 mm
, LTRF 13/15 and 9/10, respectively). We did not observe the second, minor triangular projection from the nostril rim in these specimens. Further studies will determine whether these projections are the same structures noticed by 
Mijares-Urrutia (1992)
and 
Sanchez (2010)
on several species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
. Coloration of the body of USNM 567732 (a tissue voucher that was frozen in the field in liquid nitrogen) when it was thawed and preserved (Sept., 2005) was overall greenish with extensive concentrations of pigment on the head and body and patches of iridophores above the eyes; scattered patches of greenish color on the snout; neuromasts not visible and perhaps absent; melanophores (not visible in the other field-fixed specimens) visible and rodlike.
</p>
            <p>
The LTRF of 16/21 reported for the largest tadpole (fig. 25) represents the largest labial toothrow formula known; it was erroneously reported as 17/21 and the largest value in hylids by 
Altig and McDiarmid (1999b: 308)
. The only tadpoles having large formulae that are close to the one reported here are those of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
(a maximum of 14/21), 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
(a maximum of 13/18), and the 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus armatus</tp:taxon-name>
group (a maximum of 14/17, 
Cadle and Altig, 1991
; 
Lotters et al., 2005
). Interestingly, the smaller tadpoles of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
also have smaller formulae (ranging from 9/10 to 14/18). This apparent positive association between increased total length and LTRF could be related to a similar observation recently reported by 
Sanchez (2010)
in tadpoles of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
; however, the underlying mechanism of ontogenetic increase in the number of labial tooth rows requires further study.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER SPECIES: 
Myersiohyla loveridgei
is most similar to 
M. aromatica
, from which it apparently differs by the presence of a distinct tarsal ridge (absent in 
M. aromatica
; Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). The presence of two nuptial pads differentiates 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. inparquesi
, 
M. kanaima
, and 
M. neblinaria
. Dorsal color pattern and the presence of a row of tubercles along the forearm separate 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. chamaeleo

DESCRIPTION: The descriptions provided by 
Rivero (1961
, “ 
1971
” [1972]) are adequate, but a few details are worth noting. 
Rivero (1961)
described the nuptial pad of the 
holotype
as “male with a brown rugosity on the pollex and inner finger....” Later Rivero (“1971” [1972]) described the second specimen (UPRM. 2854) as having “a smooth nuptial excrescence that extends up to the second finger.” We had access only to the 
holotype
MCZ 28565, an adult male (fig. 26). Like 

M. 
aromatica
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
, it shows two contiguous, discrete nuptial pads covered with minute epidermal projections. One of the pads is on the prepollex, and the other is on the medial-proximal surface of the first digit (

). The presence of a mental gland that occupies most of the gular region (fig. 28) is another characteristic overlooked by Rivero. 
Rivero (1961)
reported that the 
holotype
has the “vomerine odontoids forming a /--\ figure.” Our study of the same specimen suggests that the expression used by Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]), “slightly S- shaped” is quite appropriate to describe the disposition of each vomerine tooth series. There are 12 teeth on the right and 13 on the left. 
Rivero (1961)
described a slight tarsal fold in the 
holotype
; we consider it more appropriate to describe it as a distinct tarsal ridge. Foot-webbing formula for the 
holotype
is

Rivero (1961)
reported the SVL of the same specimen to be 42.0 mm.

REMARKS: The former 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
as described by 
Rivero (1961)
was based on a single male specimen from Cerro Duida, and that description was supplemented (Rivero, “1971” [1972]) with an additional male (SVL reported as 
45 mm
) from the same locality. Since its description, the species has rarely been mentioned in the literature (see 
Rivero, 1963
; 
La Marca and Smith, 1982
). While we still do not know any morphological synapomorphy for 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, we find 
<tp:taxon-name>loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
to be very close morphologically (if not a senior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
, see below) to various species included in 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, and for this reason we pose the testable hypothesis that 
<tp:taxon-name>loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
is congeneric. As morphological synapomorphies are discovered for 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, or tissues of 
<tp:taxon-name>loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
become available, its generic status should be reevaluated.
</p>
            <p>
We did not study specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
. Based solely on the thorough description provided by Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]), the only character states differentiating this species from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
seem to be the presence of a distinct tarsal ridge in the latter (Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). Since the distinctiveness of this ridge as described earlier in this paper is variable in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
, the diagnostic value of the character is tentative and needs further evaluation. Furthermore, Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) reported 30–34 total vomerine teeth, whereas the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
has 25. However, the lack of other specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
and potential variation in vomerine tooth counts precludes any conclusion regarding the diagnostic value of vomerine tooth number. Given that the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
(“Pico Culebra, Mt. Duida, 
3000 ft.
, Territorio 
Amazonas
”) is approximately 
40 km
(straight line) from the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
(“Cumbre del Tepui Huachamacari, Estado 
Amazonas
, 
Venezuela
”), and that Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) did not compare the species, we tentatively consider both species as valid, but suggest that their status deserves further study.

The second author collected an adult female specimen (USNM 550357) of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
on the summit of Cerro Duida (
1850 m
, 
03°25′N

). The point of capture is approximately 
25 km
SE (straight line) from Cerro Culebra, the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
. The specimen has differences in pattern with the two specimens described by 
Rivero (1961
; “ 
1971
” [1972]) and subtle morphological differences; for these reasons we are hesitant to assign it to 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
until more data on the variation of this species becomes available. The specimen (fig. 29) differs from the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
and the specimen described by Rivero (“1971” [1972]) in having the thighs with irregular tan spots, instead of welldefined vertical bars, and in having the tympanic annuli more inclined medially. Some measurements of this specimen are (all in mm): SVL 47.2; HL 18.0; HW 17.4; IND 3.7; IO 6.0; ED 5.3; EN 4.5; TD 2.5; TL 26.4; FL 20.1. Other morphological characteristics include a row of tubercles along the arm, quite prominent palmar and plantar tubercles (including an enlarged inner metacarpal tubercle; see fig. 30), a well-developed ridge along the tarsus, and foot webbing formula

. Dorsally the background coloration is dark reddish brown, with multiple, irregular tan mottling. The discs are pale gray. A superficial dissection reveals a group of fibers of the m. depressor mandibulae that originates on the sheath of connective tissue that extends from the dorsal fascia into the space between the head and the body, with a few fibers originating at the level of the suprascapulae. This morphology is different from that seen in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
, as in that species the fibers originating at the level of the suprascapula form a distinct fan over the suprascapulae, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
sp, most of the fibers originate in the connective tissue between head and body, with only the proximal part of approximately half of the fibers marginally reposing on the levator scapulae. The specimen is a gravid female. The dissected right ovary (left one intact) contained 
47 eggs
with largest diameters of 2.5–3.0 mm ẍ = 2.73; s = 0.15; 
n
= 15), mostly unpigmented, with the exception of a reduced, pale brown animal pole.

Orejas-Miranda and Quesada (1976) referred to an unidentified hylid from the summit of Cerro Jaua and also mentioned tadpoles with numerous labial tooth rows. Further, they published a black-and-white photograph (their fig. 6) of an adult frog that unequivocally looks like a 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
. An adult male of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
and some tadpoles with large LTRFs from Jaua are housed in the USNM (USNM 561349) and will be dealt with in a separate contribution.

THE MONOPHYLY OF 
<tp:taxon-name>MYERSIOHYLA</tp:taxon-name>
            </p>
            <p>
Although morphological synapomorphies are still unknown, 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
is recovered as monophyletic in the present phylogenetic analysis and supported with 91% parsimony jackknife absolute frequency in the static parsimony analysis. Besides the monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, the results of the analysis conducted need extensive discussion, but that requires a separate paper (Faivovich et al., in prep.), so we provide here some general comments that are expanded in appendix 1.
</p>
            <p>
Our results recover the individual monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Bokermannohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:treatment-sec sec-type="reference_group">
                  <tp:taxon-name>Aplastodiscus</tp:taxon-name>
with 100% of absolute frequency in parsimony jackknife in the static alignment, while the monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas</tp:taxon-name>
, however, has 84% in parsimony jackknife. Relationships among the five genera, which are the same as those resulting from the analysis of 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
and minor additions in subsequent analyses by 
Wiens et al. (2006
, 
2010
) and 
Pyron and Wiens (2011)
, have at least 93% in parsimony jackknife. The internal relationships of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aplastodiscus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Bokermannohyla</tp:taxon-name>
are the same as those obtained by 
Faivovich et al. (2005)

            <p>MacCulloch and Lathrop (2005)
reported on 
23 specimens
of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
collected on Mount Ayanganna, 
Guyana
. The authors reported that “enlarged black-and-white eggs, 
1 mm
in diameter, were present in 13 of the 
17 females
; the remainder had small white ova.” However, our dissection of female USNM 549311 (SVL 
46.4 mm
.) revealed 
19 eggs
in the left ovary (largest diameter 2.9–3.2, ẍ = 3.07, s = 0.12); these eggs are densely pigmented overall, and the animal and vegetal poles are not distinguishable. This observation is more in line with 
Duellman and Hoogmoed’s (1992)
report for three female 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
, which had “relatively large (
1.8 mm
diameter) ... pigmented oviducal eggs.” Differences in egg size and coloration seem most likely to reflect state of maturity.
</p>
            <p>MacCulloch and Lathrop (2005)
further described a series of tadpoles that they assigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
on the basis of the presence of two subadults and two recently metamorphosed individuals (stage 45) on the bank of the stream, plus one metamorph (stage 43) collected along with the other tadpoles. These tadpoles differ from those of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
most notably in having an oral disc with a 2/4 LTRF.
</p>
            <p>
On the basis of the taxonomic distribution of LTRFs in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cophomantini, 
Faivovich et al. (2005)</tp:taxon-name>
suggested that an increase in the number of labial tooth rows is likely a putative synapomorphy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
, because all known larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
at that time had a minimum of 6/7 labial tooth rows. They stressed, however, that the minimum number of labial tooth rows that would be a synapomorphy was ambiguous because the tadpole of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
was unknown at that time.
</p>
            <p>
Taking into account the position of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
in our phylogenetic hypothesis, nested within a group where the minimum known labial toothrow formula is 6/7, a 2/4 LTRF is a stark contrast. This could well be simply another case of homoplasy, and as such it should be considered until new evidence is gathered. The possibility of a mistaken association between subadults, juveniles and metamorphs that led to the identification of these tadpoles should also remain open to question.

         <p>Faivovich et al. (2005)
based the description of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
on 48 molecular synapomorphies identified during their phylogenetic analyses of hylid frogs. The sample used for representing the former 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
group was tissue of a frog collected by McDiarmid on Cerro de la Neblina and identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla inparquesi
Ayarzagüena and Señaris, 1994
</tp:taxon-name>
. Because this specimen was an exemplar of their new genus, 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
designated 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
as the 
type
species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
. However, subsequent study has shown that the frog (
USNM
562071 [= 
RWM 17688
)]) was misidentified and not a specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
,

but actually representative of a new species described herein as 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
. For this reason and following the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (
ICZN, 1999
: article 70.3.2), we change the 
type
species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
from 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla inparquesi
Ayarzagüena and Señaris, 1994
</tp:taxon-name>
, which was misidentified in the original designation by 
Faivovich et al. (2005)

COMPARISON WITH OTHER SPECIES: 
Myersiohyla loveridgei
is most similar to 
M. aromatica
, from which it apparently differs by the presence of a distinct tarsal ridge (absent in 
M. aromatica
; Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). The presence of two nuptial pads differentiates 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. inparquesi
, 
M. kanaima
, and 
M. neblinaria
. Dorsal color pattern and the presence of a row of tubercles along the forearm separate 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. chamaeleo
. The presence of an externally evident mental gland separates M

ETYMOLOGY: The species name 
<tp:taxon-name>neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is an adjective derived from the mountain name 
Neblina
plus the Latin suffix 
-aria
(fem. to agree with 
–hyla
of genus name), denoting a place or a connection to a place.

            <p>
COMPARISON WITH OTHER SPECIES: 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
but differs in having: hand and toe discs without sagittal black lines (present in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
); larvae with dorsal and ventral tail fins reaching the base of the tail (extending only a third in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
); larvae with scattered submarginal papillae in the upper and lower labium (apparently absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
); and larval oral disc with a single row of marginal papillae (three rows in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
). Furthermore, the advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is composed of a single note with 7–9 pulses and a duration of 295–382 ms; in contrast, the advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
is composed of two notes, one of 6 pulses and a duration of 90 ms, and the other with 7 pulses and a duration of 80 ms (Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
in its larger SVL (
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
47.7– 52.0 mm; 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>42–45 mm
; 
Rivero, 1961
; “ 
1971
” [1972]), and in having a single nuptial pad (two in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
). From 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
it differs in having a single nuptial pad, instead of two (Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]: 130); larger SVL (
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
, 
43.6–46.6 mm
; 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
47.7–52.0 mm); tadpole with dorsoventrally flattened body (globular in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
) and more rows of labial teeth (LTRF 10-13/ 
14-18 in<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
). 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
is distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
by its larger SVL (males: 37.0– 
37.8 mm
, ẍ= 37.4, 
n
= 5; females: 46.3–48.0 mm, ẍ= 47.05, 
n
= 4; 
Goin and Woodley, 1969
, and this paper), more robust body (slender in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), more developed prepollex (proportionally reduced in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), more extensive and thick nuptial pad (reduced to the dorsal margin of the prepollex, and composed of a thin layer of glandular tissue, apparently without colored epidermal projections), unpigmented eggs (completely pigmented in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
), color pattern, tadpole with dorsoventrally flattened body (depressed in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
) and more rows of labial teeth (LTRF 2/

COLORATION IN OF 
HOLOTYPE
IN PRESERVATIVE: Dorsally brown, turning darker brown toward the flanks, and with many large, irregular tan blotches; these blotches are smaller on the sides. Thick dark brown to black uniform line from tip of the snout to approximately the distal tip of urostyle. Dark, poorly defined, diffuse canthal stripe. Discs dorsally dark gray, contrasting with the brown coloration of the limbs. Hind limbs dorsally and ventrally brown; each thigh with five tan dorsal longitudinal stripes with diffuse margins that extend into the hidden areas. Shank with irregular tan blotches, some of which look dorsally continuous with those on thigh, smaller blotches on the outer surface of the foot. The only pattern present on rear surfaces of thighs are the posterior margins of the tan bars. A few tan blotches surround the cloacal region. Paracloacal tubercles tan. Ventral surfaces of body and limbs brown; subarticular, palmar, and thenar tubercles light gray. Irregular series of small tan blotches across abdomen below the pectoral region.

holotype
as a subtle dermal ridge along the tarsus is equally subtle in most 
paratypes
, with the exception of three females (
AMNHA-131172
, 
USNM 562070
and 562072), where it is quite distinct, and proximally forms a few flat tubercles.
</p>
            <p>
Most notable variation involves the coloration and color pattern, particularly regarding presence and extent of blotches (figs. 15, 19–20). We describe the variation according to the camps at which specimens were collected. Unless otherwise stated, all descriptions refer to preserved specimens. 
Camp I.
The single specimen collected at Camp I (USNM 562070), an adult female, has a barely defined dorsal pattern, being light tan with a diffuse darker reticulum. Exposed surfaces of shank and foot are light tan as well, with diffuse brown blotches. Thighs dark brown with light tan blotches. Undersides of hind limbs and forelimbs reddish brown. Abdomen and throat creamy; areas surrounding the insertion of the arms dark brown. Diffuse line borders the lower jaw. An irregular brown line extends from the mandibular symphysis up to the beginning of the pectoral region. 
Camp VII.
Coloration of two females differs notably from the 
holotype
. USNM 562072 is dorsally tan, becoming brown on the sides. It lacks the dorsal line and other discernible pattern, with the exception of some irregular, small, tan blotches on the sides. Coloration of this frog during the day was noted by Cocroft (field notes, 
Dec. 2, 1985
) as: iris coppery yellow with black reticulations; dorsal surfaces of fore- and hind limbs tan; dorsum from snout to vent brownish tan, fading to lighter tan laterally in center of body; feet mottled light tan and dark brown dorsally, toe pads dorsally dark brown, almost black in center outlined with light tan, brownish gray ventrally; sides and ventral surfaces lavender brown mottled with light tan; anterior and posterior thighs same as sides; toe webbing dark brown; light tan upper lips; tympanum coppery brown. In AMNH A-123715 the dorsal pattern is reversed with respect to the 
holotype
, with the ground coloration being tan and the blotches, which are smaller and fewer, being brown. Middorsal dorsal dark line present. Seven longitudinal bars on the thighs. In his field notes Myers described this specimen in life as “Brown with vague darker blotching and blackish brown vertebral line. Flanks and thigh mottled and banded tan and purplish brown. Ventral surfaces purplish brown with suffusion of tan across chest. Iris golden yellow with black reticulation (conspicuous but not sharply defined).” 
Camp XI.
Nine of the 
10 specimens
collected in Camp XI have the dark vertebral line. With the exception of USNM 562079, all are like the 
holotype
in the dark brown flanks with tan blotches of variable size. Most variation involves the dorsal and thigh pattern, and the hues of brown and tan. On specimens USNM 562073– 74, USNM 562076, and USNM 562079–80, the dorsal pattern is barely distinguishable. USNM 562075 is completely light tan without dorsal blotches. Specimens USNM 562077–78 and USNM 562081–82 have dorsal blotches, but their pattern is reversed from that of the 
holotype
, with their ground coloration being tan or light tan and the blotches brown.

REMARKS: The presence of a mental gland is not externally evident in male 
paratypes
of Myersiohyla neblinaria
</tp:taxon-name>
, but is evident under high power magnification (60×) or through dissections. Superficial dissections in male USNM 562074 reveal a roughly circular patch of glandular tissue in the dermis of the mental region (fig. 21). A dissection of female USNM 562072 did not indicate the presence of a mental gland.
</p>
            <p>
The vocal sac appears to be single and subgular, as indicated by the slightly distended sacs of USNM 562073, USNM 562076–77, and USNM 562080. The forearm is robust and prominent in all males, and proportionally slender in females. The prepollex is equally enlarged in males and females (figs. 17, 22). Two specimens partially dissected when tissue samples were 
<tp:material-citation>
removed (
USNM 562072♀
, and 
USNM 562077</tp:material-citation>♂
) show a translucent peritoneum and unpigmented urinary bladder. The female (SVL 60.2 mm) has large, unpigmented ovarian eggs. The dissected right ovary (left one not dissected) contained 
119 eggs
with largest diameter of 2.7– 
2.9 mm
(ẍ= 2.8; s = 0.08; 
n
= 15). The male has elongated, almost cylindrical, unpigmented testes. Females are proportionally larger than males (SVL 54.0– 
61.6 mm
, males 
47.7–52.3 mm
). Superficial dissections in male USNM 562074 reveal that the m. intermandibularis has a large diamond-shaped aponeurosis; its fibers barely contact the oval and araphic m. submentalis. Supplementary elements of the m. intermandibularis absent. The m. depressor mandibulae originates from the zygomatic ramus of the squamosal, and, contiguously, from the posterior margin of the tympanic annuli; the tympanic fibers are not differentiated as a slip. There are no fibers originating from the dorsal fascia at the level of the m. levator scapulae.

ECOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY: Near Camp I, Buck found an adult female (USNM 562070) asleep during the day in a leaf axil of 
<tp:taxon-name>Bonnetia maguireorum</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Theaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) on a small ridge northeast of Camp I (fig. 23). At Camp VII, a gravid female (USNM 562072) was collected on a vine in the forest and produced copious amounts of a milky white exudate on its back after capture. Specimens from Camp XI were collected by McDiarmid, Cocroft, and Paolillo along a small (
1–4 m
wide) forest stream with large boulders and cascades. On 
February 25, 1985
, USNM 562073 was recorded as it called beside a cascade in a clump of grass growing out of a sloping, mossy rock face about 
1 m
from the water; three other males (USNM 562074, USNM 562077–78) were on leaves and in grass clumps near cascades on sloping rocks along the same stream. USNM 562075– 76, USNM 562079–80, USNM 562082 were all collected from a rocky grotto along the same stream on the following night. An immature male (see below) was collected on a leaf of a small plant about 
15 m
from the stream that same night.
</p>
            <p>
Two of three females (USNM 562070, SVL 59.8; USNM 562072, SVL 60.2) collected on 
February 10, 1984
, and 
February 10, 1985
, respectively, were gravid. A comparable-sized female (AMNH A-123715, SVL 
61.6 mm
) collected on 
November 29, 1984
also was gravid. The fourth female (AMNH A-131172), collected 
February 9–11, 1984
, was smaller (SVL 54.0 mm) and had oocytes in very early stages of development, suggesting that she was approaching maturity. Most collected males (SVL 
47.7–52.3 mm
, 
n
= 10) had well-developed nuptial pads and presumably were capable of breeding. Calling males were heard in late 
February 1985
at Camp XI. A single smaller male (USNM 562081, SVL 40.0 mm) collected at the same time and place lacked nuptial pads and likely was immature.

            <p>
VOCALIZATION: The advertisement call of a male 
paratype
(USNM 562073) calling alone was recorded in February along a cascading stream near Camp XI (fig. 24). The frog was calling at the base of a clump of grass, about 
1 m
from the water. The recording includes 31 notes being continuously given in 80 sec of tape (the recording may contain only the terminal part of a long call).

The call is a long train of well-spaced notes given at a rate of 23.4 notes/min. Note duration is about 0.3–0.4 sec (295–382 ms, ẍ = 338 ± 21 ms,

= 20 notes) that are resolvable even by narrowband analysis (fig. 24C). The individual note is a brief musical trill, being narrowly tuned with frequency rising about 113–151 Hz throughout the note from 1522–1560 Hz at initiation to 1673 Hz at the end (
n
= 9 notes analyzed).

Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) described the advertisement call of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
as a train of 240 ms, composed of two notes, the first with six pulses (90 ms) and the second with seven pulses (70 ms). The call was described as spanning the spectrum between 1200–2000 Hz, with a harmonic at 4400 Hz and the fundamental frequency at 1740 Hz. The call repetition rate was 20 notes/min. While no illustrations or temperature data were provided by Ayarzagüena and Señaris, their description suggests a call quite different from that of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
.

Although 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
are readily diagnosable by several morphological characters (see diagnosis), the calls seem similar. The call of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
was described by Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]), on the basis of recordings done at 19° C. The call was composed of single notes with an average duration of 420 ms, with 10–11 wellspaced pulses, a dominant frequency of 2000 Hz, and a bandwidth between 1250 and 2600 Hz. The note repetition rate was 44 notes/min.

TADPOLE: The uncorrected pairwise distances of 16S sequences (table 2), between the tadpole (USNM 562732) and those of the 
holotype
, and 
paratypes
(USNM 562072, USNM 562074) are 0%–0.2%. Conversely, they are 12.3%–13.6% different from the sequences of available specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
. Considering the identical or almost identical sequences, we consider this tadpole and all others with the same general morphology (see below) to be larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
Five larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
in stage 25 were taken in the stream below Camp IX. They were found among rocks in shallow water (~ 
5 cm
deep) in slow-moving portions of the stream by day and night. A few tadpoles presumed to be of the same species (greenish gray) were seen at Camp VII (Cocroft, field notes) but none were collected. Specimens from Camp XI are quite fragile (possibly because of problems with the formalin [low pH?] at the time of fixation), especially the largest individual (USNM 562370) that was illustrated shortly after its capture and shown in figure 25. Since that time, the specimen has progressively deteriorated, particularly in that its tooth rows are separating from the tooth ridges; otherwise the remainder of the specimen is in good condition. Based on notes on the LTRF taken when the specimen was illustrated and additional observations, we describe it below and compare it with other available specimens.
</p>
            <p>Description:
A tadpole (USNM 562370, fig. 25) in stage 25 from Camp XI has the following measurements (all in mm): total length 76.0; body length 27.0; basal tail muscle height 7.8; basal tail muscle width 7.8; maximum dorsal fin height 2.8, this point being 
20 mm
away from body; maximum ventral fin height 2.8, this point being 
24.4 mm
away from body; body width 16.7; body depth 12.1; eye diameter 2.0; pupil diameter 0.8; interorbital distance 5.0; internarial distance 4.9; snout to nostril distance 6.5; snout to eye 2.5; snout to spiracle 21.7; oral disc diameter 14.9.
</p>
            <p>Oral disc enlarged and ventral; marginal papillae in single row, with contiguous papillae in offset disposition, but sometimes also forming second row. Few submarginal papillae scattered between distal labial tooth rows and labial edge. LTRF 16(16)/21(1). Gaps in rows A-16 and P-1 small, of about equal width. Teeth on proximal (closest to mouth) rows wider than teeth on distal rows; distal teeth 2–3 times more numerous per mm. Tooth density on P-1 about 35 teeth/mm. Upper jaw sheath long and slender, with uniform and small serrations. Lower jaw sheath wide, V- shaped, about four times as wide as upper jaw sheath, and with low, rounded serrations.</p>
            <p>Body dorsoventrally flattened anteriorly, ovoid posteriorly. Eyes small, dorsolateral. Snout slightly truncated in dorsal view, gently slopping in profile. Nostrils relatively small (about 60% of eye diameter), with fleshy rim and two medial, contiguous, triangular projections, anterior one quite prominent and about twice as large as the posterior one. Spiracle lateral, sinistral, its inner wall fused with body wall along its distal half; opening oriented slightly dorsally. Vent tube dextral, twice as long as wide, fused with lower fin; angular aperture. Dorsal fin originating on terminal eighth of the body, anterior to origin of tail; lower fin originating at base of tail. Neuromasts not visible but presumably present and undetected because of the almost complete loss of pigmentation as an artifact of fixation. Melanophores also not visible but presumably present (see below).</p>
            <p>
Some variation was observed in comparing the described specimen (USNM 562370) with four other smaller specimens also in stage 25 (USNM 562731: TTL 
48 mm
, LTRF 14/15; USNM 567732: TTL? [tail taken for tissue], LTRF 14/18; USNM 562731[2]: TTL 41 and 
22 mm
, LTRF 13/15 and 9/10, respectively). We did not observe the second, minor triangular projection from the nostril rim in these specimens. Further studies will determine whether these projections are the same structures noticed by 
Mijares-Urrutia (1992)
and 
Sanchez (2010)
on several species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
. Coloration of the body of USNM 567732 (a tissue voucher that was frozen in the field in liquid nitrogen) when it was thawed and preserved (Sept., 2005) was overall greenish with extensive concentrations of pigment on the head and body and patches of iridophores above the eyes; scattered patches of greenish color on the snout; neuromasts not visible and perhaps absent; melanophores (not visible in the other field-fixed specimens) visible and rodlike.
</p>
            <p>
The LTRF of 16/21 reported for the largest tadpole (fig. 25) represents the largest labial toothrow formula known; it was erroneously reported as 17/21 and the largest value in hylids by 
Altig and McDiarmid (1999b: 308)
. The only tadpoles having large formulae that are close to the one reported here are those of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
(a maximum of 14/21), 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
(a maximum of 13/18), and the 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus armatus</tp:taxon-name>
group (a maximum of 14/17, 
Cadle and Altig, 1991
; 
Lotters et al., 2005
). Interestingly, the smaller tadpoles of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
also have smaller formulae (ranging from 9/10 to 14/18). This apparent positive association between increased total length and LTRF could be related to a similar observation recently reported by 
Sanchez (2010)
in tadpoles of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
; however, the underlying mechanism of ontogenetic increase in the number of labial tooth rows requires further study.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER SPECIES: 
Myersiohyla loveridgei
is most similar to 
M. aromatica
, from which it apparently differs by the presence of a distinct tarsal ridge (absent in 
M. aromatica
; Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). The presence of two nuptial pads differentiates 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. inparquesi
, 
M. kanaima
, and 
M. neblinaria
. Dorsal color pattern and the presence of a row of tubercles along the forearm separate 
M. loveridgei
from 
M. chamaeleo
. The presence of an externally evident mental gland separates M

DESCRIPTION: The descriptions provided by 
Rivero (1961
, “ 
1971
” [1972]) are adequate, but a few details are worth noting. 
Rivero (1961)
described the nuptial pad of the 
holotype
as “male with a brown rugosity on the pollex and inner finger....” Later Rivero (“1971” [1972]) described the second specimen (UPRM. 2854) as having “a smooth nuptial excrescence that extends up to the second finger.” We had access only to the 
holotype
MCZ 28565, an adult male (fig. 26). Like 

M. 
aromatica
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
, it shows two contiguous, discrete nuptial pads covered with minute epidermal projections. One of the pads is on the prepollex, and the other is on the medial-proximal surface of the first digit (

). The presence of a mental gland that occupies most of the gular region (fig. 28) is another characteristic overlooked by Rivero. 
Rivero (1961)
reported that the 
holotype
has the “vomerine odontoids forming a /--\ figure.” Our study of the same specimen suggests that the expression used by Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]), “slightly S- shaped” is quite appropriate to describe the disposition of each vomerine tooth series. There are 12 teeth on the right and 13 on the left. 
Rivero (1961)
described a slight tarsal fold in the 
holotype
; we consider it more appropriate to describe it as a distinct tarsal ridge. Foot-webbing formula for the 
holotype
is

Rivero (1961)
reported the SVL of the same specimen to be 42.0 mm.

REMARKS: The former 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
as described by 
Rivero (1961)
was based on a single male specimen from Cerro Duida, and that description was supplemented (Rivero, “1971” [1972]) with an additional male (SVL reported as 
45 mm
) from the same locality. Since its description, the species has rarely been mentioned in the literature (see 
Rivero, 1963
; 
La Marca and Smith, 1982
). While we still do not know any morphological synapomorphy for 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, we find 
<tp:taxon-name>loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
to be very close morphologically (if not a senior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
, see below) to various species included in 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, and for this reason we pose the testable hypothesis that 
<tp:taxon-name>loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
is congeneric. As morphological synapomorphies are discovered for 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, or tissues of 
<tp:taxon-name>loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
become available, its generic status should be reevaluated.
</p>
            <p>
We did not study specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
. Based solely on the thorough description provided by Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]), the only character states differentiating this species from 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
seem to be the presence of a distinct tarsal ridge in the latter (Ayarzagüena and Señaris, “1993” [1994]). Since the distinctiveness of this ridge as described earlier in this paper is variable in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
, the diagnostic value of the character is tentative and needs further evaluation. Furthermore, Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) reported 30–34 total vomerine teeth, whereas the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
has 25. However, the lack of other specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
and potential variation in vomerine tooth counts precludes any conclusion regarding the diagnostic value of vomerine tooth number. Given that the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
(“Pico Culebra, Mt. Duida, 
3000 ft.
, Territorio 
Amazonas
”) is approximately 
40 km
(straight line) from the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
(“Cumbre del Tepui Huachamacari, Estado 
Amazonas
, 
Venezuela
”), and that Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) did not compare the species, we tentatively consider both species as valid, but suggest that their status deserves further study.

The second author collected an adult female specimen (USNM 550357) of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
on the summit of Cerro Duida (
1850 m
, 
03°25′N
, 
065°40′W
). The point of capture is approximately 
25 km
SE (straight line) from Cerro Culebra, the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
. The specimen has differences in pattern with the two specimens described by 
Rivero (1961
; “ 
1971
” [1972]) and subtle morphological differences; for these reasons we are hesitant to assign it to 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
until more data on the variation of this species becomes available. The specimen (fig. 29) differs from the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
and the specimen described by Rivero (“1971” [1972]) in having the thighs with irregular tan spots, instead of welldefined vertical bars, and in having the tympanic annuli more inclined medially. Some measurements of this specimen are (all in mm): SVL 47.2; HL 18.0; HW 17.4; IND 3.7; IO 6.0; ED 5.3; EN 4.5; TD 2.5; TL 26.4; FL 20.1. Other morphological characteristics include a row of tubercles along the arm, quite prominent palmar and plantar tubercles (including an enlarged inner metacarpal tubercle; see fig. 30), a well-developed ridge along the tarsus, and foot webbing formula

. Dorsally the background coloration is dark reddish brown, with multiple, irregular tan mottling. The discs are pale gray. A superficial dissection reveals a group of fibers of the m. depressor mandibulae that originates on the sheath of connective tissue that extends from the dorsal fascia into the space between the head and the body, with a few fibers originating at the level of the suprascapulae. This morphology is different from that seen in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
, as in that species the fibers originating at the level of the suprascapula form a distinct fan over the suprascapulae, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
sp, most of the fibers originate in the connective tissue between head and body, with only the proximal part of approximately half of the fibers marginally reposing on the levator scapulae. The specimen is a gravid female. The dissected right ovary (left one intact) contained 
47 eggs
with largest diameters of 2.5–3.0 mm ẍ = 2.73; s = 0.15; 
n
= 15), mostly unpigmented, with the exception of a reduced, pale brown animal pole.

Orejas-Miranda and Quesada (1976) referred to an unidentified hylid from the summit of Cerro Jaua and also mentioned tadpoles with numerous labial tooth rows. Further, they published a black-and-white photograph (their fig. 6) of an adult frog that unequivocally looks like a 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
. An adult male of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>

19 eggs
in the left ovary (largest diameter 2.9–3.2, ẍ = 3.07, s = 0.12); these eggs are densely pigmented overall, and the animal and vegetal poles are not distinguishable. This observation is more in line with 
Duellman and Hoogmoed’s (1992)

on the basis of the presence of two subadults and two recently metamorphosed individuals (stage 45) on the bank of the stream, plus one metamorph (stage 43) collected along with the other tadpoles. These tadpoles differ from those of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
most notably in having an oral disc with a 2/4 LTRF.
</p>
            <p>
On the basis of the taxonomic distribution of LTRFs in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cophomantini, 
Faivovich et al. (2005)</tp:taxon-name>
suggested that an increase in the number of labial tooth rows is likely a putative synapomorphy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
, because all known larvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
at that time had a minimum of 6/7 labial tooth rows. They stressed, however, that the minimum number of labial tooth rows that would be a synapomorphy was ambiguous because the tadpole of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
was unknown at that time.
</p>
            <p>
Taking into account the position of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
in our phylogenetic hypothesis, nested within a group where the minimum known labial toothrow formula is 6/7, a 2/4 LTRF is a stark contrast. This could well be simply another case of homoplasy, and as such it should be considered until new evidence is gathered. The possibility of a mistaken association between subadults, juveniles and metamorphs that led to the identification of these tadpoles should also remain open to question.

, and 
<tp:taxon-name>L. subglandulosa</tp:taxon-name>
(
Tyler and Anstis, 1975
; 
Mahony et al., 2001
). The occurrence of a mental gland in males of at least four species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
) indicates that mental glands are more frequent than previously reported. Furthermore, the fact that these structures sometimes are evident only through superficial dissections suggests that they might be more widespread, but unnoticed.
</p>
         <p>5Barrio-Amoros and Brewer-Carias (2008: 32)
, while describing a new species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas benitezi</tp:taxon-name>
group stated: “ 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas tepuianus</tp:taxon-name>
apparently has a mental gland (sensu Faivovich et al., 2006). We did not consider this character in the diagnosis or description, because we consider that it is very subjective, and not easy to determine. For instance, while it is easily identifiable in 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus colymbus</tp:taxon-name>
[sic!], 
<tp:taxon-name>H. palmeri</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. albopunctulatus</tp:taxon-name>
(see 

in Faivovich et al. 2006), it is much less obvious in 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas nympha</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. lemai</tp:taxon-name>
(same 

; Faivovich et al. 2006), and to us, an object of subjective appreciation. In two specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. lemai</tp:taxon-name>
examined (to be deposited in ERBG), the senior author could not distinguish the mental gland. In two more specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. jimenezi</tp:taxon-name>
, he either could see any gland (in accordance with Señaris and Ayarzagüena, 2006). Examining the mental zone of male 
paratypes
of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. tepuianus</tp:taxon-name>
, is possible to discern a whitish quadrangular area, but it is also present in the female. For this reason, we cannot conclude with confidence that this is the mentioned gland of Faivovich et al. (2006.)”
</p>
         <p>A
recent study on the mental gland of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas punctatus
(
Brunetti et al., 2012
)
</tp:taxon-name>
revealed that at least in that species, the male mental gland represents a region of accumulation of sexually dimorphic, specialized mucous and granular glands that occur as well on the flanks of the body. Whether this is also the case in the other 
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
remains an open question.
</p>
         <p>
We did not study specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>M. inparquesi</tp:taxon-name>
,

so we do not know whether a mental gland is present in these species. We had five males of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
available for study; all of these have scattered glandular units in the gular region, much less evident than in other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
. Available data (McCulloch and Lathrop, 2005; Bruce Means, personal commun.) indicate that none of these males were collected while calling. For this reason, and considering that we have no knowledge regarding the physiological mechanisms involved in the development of the gland, at this stage it is unclear whether its occurrence as scattered units in the gular region of in apparently nonreproductive males of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
results from a real difference in the development of the gland in this species, or because of the physiological condition of the available males.

Continued from previous page
) It is unnecessary to argue whether the mental gland being “easy” to determine invalidates its diagnostic value. However some clarifications are in order regarding the “subjective” nature of the gland, for which, at the histological level, the study of 
Brunetti et al. (2012)
should be enough to dispel any doubt. Faivovich et al. (2006) included in their figure 4 photographs of mental glands of different species precisely to show what seems to be confusing for Barrio-Amorós and Brewer-Cárias: When they occur, mental glands do have different morphologies in different groups. The reference to a “whitish quadrangular area” rather than to the glandular units suggests confusion about the nature of the gland itself. It seems odd that the presence of the gland in females, as Barrio-Amorós and Brewer-Cárias apparently interpret in 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas tepuianus</tp:taxon-name>
(on the basis of the “whitish quadrangular area”), could be taken as a reason to suspect that it is actually a gland, unless they were under the impression that mental glands occur only in mature males which is not the case. For example, 
Duellman (1972: 21
, 25, 27) referred to mental glands occurring in both males and females of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus colymba</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. phyllognathus</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. platydactylus</tp:taxon-name>
. The reference to its absence in 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas jimenezi</tp:taxon-name>
, a species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
group, is perplexing, as Señaris and Ayarzagüena (2006) explicitly stated that it was absent
</p>
         <p>.</p>
         <p>
The presence of unpigmented eggs has commonly been associated with a spawn protected from direct solar light (
Salthe, 1963
; 
Altig and McDiarmid, 2007
). Ova in 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
show three patterns of pigmentation. The presence of large, pigmented eggs in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
is remarkable in that the co-occurrence of large amounts of yolk (resulting in large-sized eggs) and dense pigmentation is quite unusual in anurans, as is the pigmentation of the vegetal pole. Furthermore, we have been unable to find records in the literature of other anuran species having comparable levels of pigmentation. Clearly the situation deserves further study. In 
<tp:taxon-name>M. chamaeleo</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
, the eggs are completely unpigmented. In the specimen here referred as 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
sp., the eggs are mostly unpigmented, with the exception of a reduced brown animal pole.

La Marca (1985)
noted that eggs of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. jahni</tp:taxon-name>
have been found in turbulent waters, while those of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. platydactylus</tp:taxon-name>
have been found deposited on leaves of certain streamside plants in the families 
<tp:taxon-name>Lauraceae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Melastomataceae</tp:taxon-name>
, without providing any further details. Relatively large, unpigmented eggs are also reported in 
<tp:taxon-name>Aplastodiscus</tp:taxon-name>
(
Haddad and Sawaya, 2000
; 
Haddad et al., 2005
), and in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas benitezi</tp:taxon-name>
group (Faivovich et al., 2006). In 
<tp:taxon-name>Aplastodiscus</tp:taxon-name>
eggs are deposited in a subterranean nest built by the male (
Haddad and Sawaya, 2000
; 
Haddad et al., 2005
); no data regarding oviposition site are available for species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. benitezi</tp:taxon-name>
group. The diversity of reproductive modes, at least three (oviposition in lotic waters, on leaves, and on subterranean nests), associated with large and unpigmented eggs in groups closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, preclude any prediction regarding its reproductive mode or modes.

COMMENT ON ODORS 
AND
EXUDATES
</p>
      <p>
Ayarzagüena and Señaris (“1993” [1994]) included “strong odor” as a diagnostic character of the former 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyla aromatica</tp:taxon-name>
group, and 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
considered this trait a potential synapomorphy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
if it were shown to be present in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. loveridgei</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. kanaima</tp:taxon-name>
, in which a strong odor has not been yet recorded. We report here the presence of copious amounts
</p>
      <p>6Kizirian et al. (2003)
reported large ovarian eggs (

) in an eleventh species of

<tp:taxon-name>H

tapichalaca</tp:taxon-name>
, but made no reference to their pigmentation. 
Cochran and Goin (1970)

<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus bogotensis</tp:taxon-name>
, but provide no information on egg diameter.

of a milky white exudate in the back of a female of 
<tp:taxon-name>M. neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
(
USNM
562072); unfortunately no reference to odors was recorded (Paolillo, field notes).
</p>
      <p>
However, the possibility that strong odor and/or exudates could be synapomorphy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
deserves further scrutiny in the light of the phylogenetic context hypothesized by 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
and of other published records of secretions with strong odors in other 
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
. So far, a strong odor has been reported for two species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus bogotensis</tp:taxon-name>
group and three of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. larinopygion</tp:taxon-name>
group. Among the species included in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. bogotensis</tp:taxon-name>
group, 
La Marca (1985)
reported a strong odor and smelly exudate in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. platydactylus</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
La Marca (1985)
reported a sticky exudate with a different smell in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. jahni</tp:taxon-name>
. Taran Grant who actively smells every frog he collects (seriously) did not perceive any odor in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. alytolylax</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>H. palmeri</tp:taxon-name>
(Grant, personal commun.). Lucas Barrientos (personal commun.) noticed a strong odor in several specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. bogotensis</tp:taxon-name>
from various localities in 
Colombia
. 
Reynolds and Foster (1992)
reported that an adult female of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. armatus</tp:taxon-name>
produced copious skin secretions when handled, similar to “rubber-cement,” but made no reference to its smell. 
Kizirian et al. (2003)
reported a sticky white fluid with strong odor in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. tapichalaca</tp:taxon-name>
, a member of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. larinopygion</tp:taxon-name>
group. Ronn Altig (personal commun.) noticed a strong odor associated with the three paratopotypes of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. lindae</tp:taxon-name>
, another member of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H
. 
larinopygion</tp:taxon-name>
group that he collected in eastern 
Ecuador
(
Duellman and Altig, 1978
), and recalled that the frogs seemed to produce a clear exudate that made them shine. Grant and Barrientos (personal commun.) also noticed a strong odor in several specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. larinopygion</tp:taxon-name>
from various localities in 
Colombia
. 
Rivera-Correa and Faivovich (2013)
recently reported the release of a white secretion with strong smell in 
<tp:taxon-name>H. antioquia</tp:taxon-name>
.

      <p>A
strong odor is known to occur as well in at least seven species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas pulchellus</tp:taxon-name>

Gallardo, 1958

Azevedo-Ramos (1995)
reported that two out of 79 studied males of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. semilineatus</tp:taxon-name>
(using the name 
<tp:taxon-name>H. geographicus</tp:taxon-name>
) emitted a strong odor when defensive behaviors were elicited. 
Bokermann (1964)
noticed that 
<tp:taxon-name>Bokermannohyla martinsi</tp:taxon-name>
secretes a copious exudate when handled, but made no reference to its smell. 
Lutz (1973)
noticed that 
<tp:taxon-name>Bokermannohyla claresignata</tp:taxon-name>
smells like crushed plants, a suitable description of the smell of the species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas</tp:taxon-name>
listed above, as well as that of 
<tp:taxon-name>B. ahenea</tp:taxon-name>

(Célio F.B. Haddad, personal commun.; J.F., personal obs.). However, species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Bokermannohyla</tp:taxon-name>
have a stronger smell than 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas</tp:taxon-name>
(J.F., personal obs.)
</p>
      <p>
Besides the need for increased understanding of the taxonomic distribution of strong odor within 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, the possibility that the strong odor could actually be more common in 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
than currently known deserves some consideration. This is relevant because 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
found 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
to be the sister taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
plus the remaining 
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Bokermannohyla</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aplastodiscus</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas</tp:taxon-name>
). Although it would ultimately depend on the internal topology of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
, if strong odor actually occurs in more species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
,

optimizing it as a plesiomorphic character state on its ingroup node, strong odor might be a synapomorphy of a more inclusive clade (
<tp:taxon-name>Cophomantini</tp:taxon-name>
?), not just 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla</tp:taxon-name>
. Unfortunately, additional speculation is hampered by the total lack of knowledge regarding the chemical nature of the odors and secretions and the scarce and anecdotal knowledge of their taxonomic distribution among hylines and other frogs. Another problem is the basis for determining what and how odors are to be considered homologous and how they are associated with secretions. Clearly the ideal situation would be to understand their chemical nature, but in the absence of this, one would expect that odors minimally would smell similarly (however, this might be a function of concentration; see below) or would be associated with secretions of similar consistency or appearance (i.e., milky, white, sticky, etc). Certainly no systematic effort to study the occurrence of odor in 
<tp:taxon-name>Hylinae</tp:taxon-name>
has been made, as has been done in 
<tp:taxon-name>Pelodryadinae</tp:taxon-name>
(
Smith et al., 2003

2004a
, 
2004b
).

It should be realized that anurans and other amphibians secrete a great number of biologically active substances, mostly from integumentary granular glands. These substances include biogenic amines, peptides, bufodienolides, and more than (at last count) 800 chemically diverse alkaloids—bioactive organic nitrogenous ring compounds that until the latter half of the 20th century were generally thought to originate solely from plants. The chemistry and pharmacology of amphibian exudates was pioneered by our late colleague John Daly, whose bibliography includes over 200 papers on compounds found in amphibian skin (see

). But if the chemistry of such compounds is in its infancy (as Daly might have stated), the chemistry of volatile amphibian secretions is a science not yet born. The dendrobatoid genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
was named (
Myers et al., 1991
) for the strong mercaptan-like odor of the 
type
species (
<tp:taxon-name>A. nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
). Efforts to demonstrate mercaptans or other volatile compounds were unsuccessful; for Daly’s protocols, see 
Myers et al. (1991: 14)
. The analytical difficulty for mercaptans and probably many other compounds is that the human nose is sensitive enough to detect mercaptans at the level of parts per billion. Compounds responsible for such odors may originate from much lower levels than suggested by vertebrate olfactory systems. Thus, the failure to detect seemingly diagnostic odors when handling or skinning frogs (e.g., other species currently assigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
) provides no proof that the suspected compound is absent. Such “negative data” are worthy of note but currently lack phylogenetic usefulness.

The Cerro de la Neblina Expedition (1984–1985) was organized in 
Venezuela
by the Fundación para el Desarrollo de las Ciencias Físicas, Matemáticas y Naturales (FUDECI) under sponsorship of the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Tecnológicas, the Instituto Nacional de Parques, and the Ministerio de Educación. Charles Brewer-Carias ably served as coordinator and expedition leader. McDiarmid and Myers’ participation was supported primarily by grants from the National Science Foundation (BSR83-17687 [Zoology] to American Museum of Natural History, R.W. McDiarmid, C.W. Myers, and J.G. Rozen, Jr., coprincipal investigators; BSR83-18375 [Botany], New York Botanical Garden, J.P. Luteyn and G. Davidse, coprincipal investigators; and BSR83-17561 [Coordination], New York Botanical Garden, J.P. Luteyn and R.W. McDiarmid, coprincipal investigators). Participation of scientists from the American Museum of Natural History also was made possible by support from William H. Phelps Fund and of those from the National Museum of Natural History by the Scholarly Studies Program of the Smithsonian Institution. McDiarmid also thanks the many scientists and associates with whom he shared the Neblina experience and especially those field companions who went out of their way to collect specimens (adults and larvae), record calls, and take tissues and photographs of new species of frogs reported in this work: R. Cocroft,

Venezuela
. Anna Asquith illustrated the tadpoles and Fiona Wilkinson assisted with the sound analyses and certain aspects of preparing some of the illustrations. Taran Grant, Gilson Rivas, and Jose 
A
. Langone provided helpful information and/or photographs of critical specimens, and Ronn Altig shared some of his field experiences with 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus lindae</tp:taxon-name>
with us and commented on parts of the manuscript. Ward Wheeler allowed use of his molecular systematics lab to produce some of the sequences. Robert Murphy, Amy Lathrop, and Ross MacCulloch (Royal Ontario Museum), and James Hanken and Jose Rosado (Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University) loaned relevant specimens. Ronn Altig and José P. Pombal, Jr., kindly read the manuscript and provided useful comments. We appreciate their help.

Representative specimens from the 
type
series will be deposited in the Venezuelan collection at Museo de la Estación Biológica de Rancho Grande, Maracay (MBRG). Specimens from Myers’ 1984 Neblina collections (including a specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>Myersiohyla neblinaria</tp:taxon-name>
) were deposited in the Museo Biología de la Instituto de Zoología Tropical, Universidad Central de

For helping to save or prevent delay of an important part of the Neblina Expedition, participants owe special thanks to Robert G. Goelet, former president and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of the American Museum of Natural History. The Neblina Expedition was closed down between late 
July and November 1984
, with subsequent notification from FUDECI that it could not be resumed before 
February1985
. Some of the problems were standard political ones, but another involved the serious problem of funding for helicopter support. When informed of the latter, Mr. Goelet promised substantial support for chartering private helicopters. That promise notably uplifted the spirits of those engaged in expedition logistics and appeared to stimulate intragovernment cooperation. Chartering private aircraft proved, after all, not necessary and the Venezuelan Air Force (FAV) was able to resume its superb role in providing helicopter support for the montane camps. Goelet’s financial support of other tepui expeditions is well known, but the pronounced impact of the support that he 
offered
to the Neblina Expedition has not been publicized. (

FURTHER COMMENTS ON 
THE
PHYLOGENETIC RESULTS The results support the monophyly of the three species groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
, the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. armatus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. bogotensis</tp:taxon-name>
,

and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. larinopygion</tp:taxon-name>
groups (fig. 2). Eleven known species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. bogotensis</tp:taxon-name>
group are absent from our analysis, so our results are not a stringent test of its monophyly. This is an important limitation considering that its only putative morphological synapomorphy so far known, the mental gland in males, has been shown to be present as well in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. armatus</tp:taxon-name>
group (
Faivovich and De la Riva, 2006
). The relationships of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. larinopygion</tp:taxon-name>
group, from which we have a taxonomic sampling identical to that of 
Coloma et al. (2012)
, are the same as those obtained in that paper on their parsimony analysis. Differences with the topologies of their maximum likelihood and bayesian analyses only involve the position the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. armatus</tp:taxon-name>
group and that of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. larinopygion</tp:taxon-name>
(sister taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. lindae</tp:taxon-name>
+ 
<tp:taxon-name>H. pantostictus</tp:taxon-name>
on our analysis vs. sister taxon of a clade containing all species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hyloscirtus</tp:taxon-name>
excluding the former clade and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. tapichalaca</tp:taxon-name>
on their analyses) and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. tigrinus</tp:taxon-name>
(sister taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. criptico</tp:taxon-name>
+ 
<tp:taxon-name>H. pacha</tp:taxon-name>
+ 
<tp:taxon-name>H. stauferorum</tp:taxon-name>
on our analysis vs sister taxon of the latter clade plus 
<tp:taxon-name>H. psarolaimus</tp:taxon-name>
on theirs). 
Coloma et al. (2012)
on their maximum likelihood analysis obtain the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. armatus</tp:taxon-name>
group as the sister taxon of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. bogotensis</tp:taxon-name>
group. However, on their Bayesian analysis (though with poor support), in the present analysis and those of 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
, 
Wiens et al. (2006
, 
2010
), and 
Pyron and Wiens (2011)
, it is supported (Jackknife absolute frequency 94%) as the sister taxon of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. larinopygion</tp:taxon-name>
group. This difference could be related to the fact that 
Coloma et al. (2012)
limited their analysis to mitochondrial sequences, as well as to the low density of outgroups employed by them.
</p>
         <p>
Regarding the relationships within 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas</tp:taxon-name>
our results are similar to those obtained by 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
in terms of the monophyly of most of the species groups that they recognized, but relationships among them differ (fig. 31). Subsequent to 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
, sequences of a few more species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas</tp:taxon-name>
became available in Genbank through the papers of 
Salducci (2005)
and 
Wiens et al. (2005
, 
2006
). Most of these sequences were included in the analyses of 
Wiens et al. (2010)
and 
Pyron and Wiens (2011)
, who made no comments about relationships of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas</tp:taxon-name>
. These additions allow additional testing of the monophyly of the species groups recognized by 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
. The position of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. dentei</tp:taxon-name>
in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. albopunctatus</tp:taxon-name>
group, and that of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. rosenbergi</tp:taxon-name>
as sister taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. crepitans</tp:taxon-name>
in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. faber</tp:taxon-name>
group, corroborate the monophyly of those groups as defined by 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
. On the basis of the monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. cinerascens</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. picturatus</tp:taxon-name>
,

and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
in their analysis, these authors recognized the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
group, including all species that had been tentatively associated with those species available to them. The 
<tp:taxon-name>H. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
group, as recognized by these authors included 
<tp:taxon-name>H. alemani</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. atlanticus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. hobbsi</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. ornatissimus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. cinerascens</tp:taxon-name>
(as 
<tp:taxon-name>H. granosus</tp:taxon-name>
), 
<tp:taxon-name>H. picturatus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. sibleszi</tp:taxon-name>
, to which 
Señariz and Ayarzagüena (2006)
added 
<tp:taxon-name>H. jimenezi</tp:taxon-name>
and 
Kok (2006)
added 
<tp:taxon-name>H. liliae</tp:taxon-name>
. Only short sequences of 
<tp:taxon-name>H. ornatissimus</tp:taxon-name>
had been added to the original sampling of the group by 
Faivovich et al. (2005)
. The 
<tp:taxon-name>H. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
group was not particularly well supported in their analysis, and the exemplars available to them are not monophyletic in our results. 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas ornatissimus</tp:taxon-name>
, interestingly, is nested in the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. benitezi</tp:taxon-name>
group, and should be included in that group. 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas sibleszi</tp:taxon-name>
is the sister taxon of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. semilineatus</tp:taxon-name>
group, but this node is poorly supported. The remaining three exemplars of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
group, the nominal species, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. cinerascens</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>H. picturatus</tp:taxon-name>
are monophyletic, with low support. The non-monophyly of the 
<tp:taxon-name>H. punctatus</tp:taxon-name>
group makes it imperative to include its remaining species (particularly 
<tp:taxon-name>H. alemani</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. jimenezi</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. hobbsi</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>H. liliae</tp:taxon-name>
) in order to understand their relationships with the other groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypsiboas</tp:taxon-name>
.
