         <p>
The eotrechine water striders of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa
Esaki
</tp:taxon-name>
show strong preferences for their hygropetric habitats, mainly small pools or stagnant water-bodies within undisturbed forest areas along sandy, rocky and muddy streambeds or river banks, especially in association with hill streams and waterfalls. They are generally found resting on wet soil near to the shore or edge of the water body. These small, oval bugs can be easily identified by the silvery markings on the dorsal surface of the body and by having the hind leg relatively shorter than the middle leg.
</p>
         <p>
During a survey in the Darjeeling District and Jalpaiguri District of West Bengal, the authors collected two new species from two different forest streams, which are tributaries of Teesta River. These new species, described herein, are the fifth and sixth 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa</tp:taxon-name>
species known from 
India
.

         <p>Study Area:
The 
<tp:taxon-name>Mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
Wildlife Sanctuary in the Darjeeling District of West Bengal, is situated at an altitude of 
180 m
in the Himalayan foothills. It is one of the major conservation areas in the ‘Dooars’ of North Bengal. The new species 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, was collected from a shady, stagnant pool along the Panchanoi River, a tributary of Teesta, within the Sanctuary. The other new species, 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, was collected from a slow flowing jungle stream, the Kalikhola, in the Jalpaiguri District of West Bengal. The Kalikhola forms the borderline between two Conservation areas: the Gorumara National Park and Chapramari Wildlife Sanctuary.
</p>
         <p>Methods:
The specimens were collected using a rectangle-shaped aquatic net, and preserved in 
70
% ethyl alcohol in glass vials. The morphological and genitalic studies were undertaken using a Leica M 
205
A stereo zoom binocular microscope. The male genital segment was dissected and immersed in 
10
% KOH for 
30
minutes to allow detailed studies.

The

is a close relative of 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa speciosa
Polhemus &amp; Andersen, 
1984</tp:taxon-name>
from southern 
Vietnam
. However, we have examined the 
paratype
series of the latter species, held in the collection of the Bishop Museum, and find that the two species exhibit the following differences: 
1
) the males of both species possess three black hairy patches on the fore femur, but in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. speciosa</tp:taxon-name>
the middle patch is more elongate and tapering, and is separated from the more distal patch by a gap that is two times greater than the distance to the basal patch, rather than being equidistant between the basal and distal patches as seen in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
(

); 
2
) in 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
the pygophore when viewed laterally is slightly curved upward towards its distal end and apically pointed, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa speciosa
Polhemus &amp; Andersen
</tp:taxon-name>
the pygophore lies in a horizontal orientation, and is rounded apically (compare 

to Fig. 
86 in
J. Polhemus &amp; Andersen 
1984
); 
3
) the male lateral arms of proctiger of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
are distally curved (

), and in ventral view fold under the subapical portion of the pygophore (

), whereas in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. speciosa</tp:taxon-name>
the lateral arms of proctiger are distally straight in both lateral and ventral views, with their distal sections lying parallel to the pygophore and not folding underneath it, and their apices more acuminate (compare 

to Fig. 
86 in
J. Polhemus &amp; Andersen

4
) in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
the proctiger of the male is arrow-shaped and bears long setae medially, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. speciosa</tp:taxon-name>
the proctiger possesses only a few setae on its outer margin. This character state combination involving the form of the male genitalic structures, the fore leg structure (specifically the form of the three hair tufts on male fore femur), and the pattern of markings on the pro-, meso- and metanota of both sexes serves to distinguish this species from others in the genus

            <p>Etymology.
The male lateral projection of the proctiger in this new species is bifurcated in the middle, giving rise to two different parts, which is a defining character of this species. Hence, the specific epithet ‘ 
<tp:taxon-name>bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
’ is derived from the unique form of the male genitalic structures.
</p>
            <p>Habitat.

paratype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>

1
) The basal two hair tufts on the male fore femur are similar in both species, but 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
possess two tufts distally, consisting of an acuminate tuft just beyond the central concavity followed by a broad brushy tuft (

), whereas in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>
only the acuminate tuft is present; in addition, the basal section of the male fore femur is more strongly incrassate in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
; 
2
) In 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
, the pygophore is much wider than in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>
(

); and 
3
) in lateral view, the more ventral of the two bifurcated lateral arms of the proctiger is very slender in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>
, while being thicker and more massive in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
; in dorsal and ventral views, by contrast, the shapes of the ventral arms are similar in both species.

series of the latter species, held in the collection of the Bishop Museum, and find that the two species exhibit the following differences: 
1
) the males of both species possess three black hairy patches on the fore femur, but in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. speciosa</tp:taxon-name>
the middle patch is more elongate and tapering, and is separated from the more distal patch by a gap that is two times greater than the distance to the basal patch, rather than being equidistant between the basal and distal patches as seen in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
(

); 
2
) in 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
the pygophore when viewed laterally is slightly curved upward towards its distal end and apically pointed, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa speciosa
Polhemus &amp; Andersen
</tp:taxon-name>
the pygophore lies in a horizontal orientation, and is rounded apically (compare 

to Fig. 
86 in
J. Polhemus &amp; Andersen 
1984
); 
3
) the male lateral arms of proctiger of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
are distally curved (

), and in ventral view fold under the subapical portion of the pygophore (

), whereas in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. speciosa</tp:taxon-name>
the lateral arms of proctiger are distally straight in both lateral and ventral views, with their distal sections lying parallel to the pygophore and not folding underneath it, and their apices more acuminate (compare 

to Fig. 
86 in
J. Polhemus &amp; Andersen 
1984
); and 
4
) in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
the proctiger of the male is arrow-shaped and bears long setae medially, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. speciosa</tp:taxon-name>
the proctiger possesses only a few setae on its outer margin. This character state combination involving the form of the male genitalic structures, the fore leg structure (specifically the form of the three hair tufts on male fore femur), and the pattern of markings on the pro-, meso- and metanota of both sexes serves to distinguish this species from others in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa</tp:taxon-name>

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="etymology">
            <p>Etymology.
The male lateral projection of the proctiger in this new species is bifurcated in the middle, giving rise to two different parts, which is a defining character of this species. Hence, the specific epithet ‘ 
<tp:taxon-name>bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
’ is derived from the unique form of the male genitalic structures.
</p>
            <p>Habitat.
The 
type
series of 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
was collected from a slow flowing stream, Kalikhola, located in boundary between Gorumara and Chapramari forest of West Bengal, 
India
. The 
paratypes
of this new species were collected from Bania River, a tributary of Teesta River, flowing across the Chilapata forest of Jalpaiguri district, West Bengal.

is closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata
J. Polhemus &amp; Andersen, 
1984</tp:taxon-name>
, first described from Dehradun, Uttarakhand. We have examined a male 
paratype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>
from the 
type
locality and find the following differences involving the male forelegs and male genitalia: 
1
) The basal two hair tufts on the male fore femur are similar in both species, but 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
possess two tufts distally, consisting of an acuminate tuft just beyond the central concavity followed by a broad brushy tuft (

), whereas in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>
only the acuminate tuft is present; in addition, the basal section of the male fore femur is more strongly incrassate in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
; 
2
) In 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
, the pygophore is much wider than in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>
(

); and 
3
) in lateral view, the more ventral of the two bifurcated lateral arms of the proctiger is very slender in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>
, while being thicker and more massive in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
; in dorsal and ventral views, by contrast, the shapes of the ventral arms are similar in both species.

Wildlife Sanctuary of the Darjeeling District, West Bengal. The specific epithet ‘

</p>
            <p>Habitat.
The 
type
series of specimens was collected from a shaded, stagnant pool covered with algae, created by the Panchanoi River within the forest, and also from the banks of the slow-flowing, shady Panchanoi River. This species was found in good numbers near the steep, shaded banks of the stream.

is a close relative of 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa speciosa
Polhemus &amp; Andersen, 
1984</tp:taxon-name>
from southern 
Vietnam
. However, we have examined the 
paratype
series of the latter species, held in the collection of the Bishop Museum, and find that the two species exhibit the following differences: 
1
) the males of both species possess three black hairy patches on the fore femur, but in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. speciosa</tp:taxon-name>
the middle patch is more elongate and tapering, and is separated from the more distal patch by a gap that is two times greater than the distance to the basal patch, rather than being equidistant between the basal and distal patches as seen in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
(

); 
2
) in 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
the pygophore when viewed laterally is slightly curved upward towards its distal end and apically pointed, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa speciosa
Polhemus &amp; Andersen
</tp:taxon-name>
the pygophore lies in a horizontal orientation, and is rounded apically (compare 

to Fig. 
86 in
J. Polhemus &amp; Andersen 
1984
); 
3
) the male lateral arms of proctiger of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
are distally curved (

), and in ventral view fold under the subapical portion of the pygophore (

), whereas in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. speciosa</tp:taxon-name>
the lateral arms of proctiger are distally straight in both lateral and ventral views, with their distal sections lying parallel to the pygophore and not folding underneath it, and their apices more acuminate (compare 

to Fig. 
86 in
J. Polhemus &amp; Andersen 
1984
); and 
4
) in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
the proctiger of the male is arrow-shaped and bears long setae medially, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. speciosa</tp:taxon-name>
the proctiger possesses only a few setae on its outer margin. This character state combination involving the form of the male genitalic structures, the fore leg structure (specifically the form of the three hair tufts on male fore femur), and the pattern of markings on the pro-, meso- and metanota of both sexes serves to distinguish this species from others in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa</tp:taxon-name>

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="etymology">
            <p>Etymology.
The male lateral projection of the proctiger in this new species is bifurcated in the middle, giving rise to two different parts, which is a defining character of this species. Hence, the specific epithet ‘ 
<tp:taxon-name>bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
’ is derived from the unique form of the male genitalic structures.
</p>
            <p>Habitat.
The 
type
series of 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
was collected from a slow flowing stream, Kalikhola, located in boundary between Gorumara and Chapramari forest of West Bengal, 
India
. The 
paratypes
of this new species were collected from Bania River, a tributary of Teesta River, flowing across the Chilapata forest of Jalpaiguri district, West Bengal.

is closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata
J. Polhemus &amp; Andersen, 
1984</tp:taxon-name>
, first described from Dehradun, Uttarakhand. We have examined a male 
paratype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>
from the 
type
locality and find the following differences involving the male forelegs and male genitalia: 
1
) The basal two hair tufts on the male fore femur are similar in both species, but 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
possess two tufts distally, consisting of an acuminate tuft just beyond the central concavity followed by a broad brushy tuft (

), whereas in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>
only the acuminate tuft is present; in addition, the basal section of the male fore femur is more strongly incrassate in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
; 
2
) In 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
, the pygophore is much wider than in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>
(

); and 
3
) in lateral view, the more ventral of the two bifurcated lateral arms of the proctiger is very slender in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>
, while being thicker and more massive in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
; in dorsal and ventral views, by contrast, the shapes of the ventral arms are similar in both species.

Polhemus &amp; Andersen, 
1984</tp:taxon-name>
from southern 
Vietnam
. However, we have examined the 
paratype
series of the latter species, held in the collection of the Bishop Museum, and find that the two species exhibit the following differences: 
1
) the males of both species possess three black hairy patches on the fore femur, but in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. speciosa</tp:taxon-name>
the middle patch is more elongate and tapering, and is separated from the more distal patch by a gap that is two times greater than the distance to the basal patch, rather than being equidistant between the basal and distal patches as seen in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
(

); 
2
) in 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
the pygophore when viewed laterally is slightly curved upward towards its distal end and apically pointed, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>Amemboa speciosa
Polhemus &amp; Andersen
</tp:taxon-name>
the pygophore lies in a horizontal orientation, and is rounded apically (compare 

to Fig. 
86 in
J. Polhemus &amp; Andersen 
1984
); 
3
) the male lateral arms of proctiger of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
are distally curved (

), and in ventral view fold under the subapical portion of the pygophore (

), whereas in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. speciosa</tp:taxon-name>
the lateral arms of proctiger are distally straight in both lateral and ventral views, with their distal sections lying parallel to the pygophore and not folding underneath it, and their apices more acuminate (compare 

to Fig.

J. Polhemus &amp; Andersen

4
) in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. mahananda</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
the proctiger of the male is arrow-shaped and bears long setae medially, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. speciosa</tp:taxon-name>
the proctiger possesses only a few setae on its outer margin. This character state combination involving the form of the male genitalic structures, the fore leg structure (specifically the form of the three hair tufts on male fore femur), and the pattern of markings on the pro-, meso- and metanota of both sexes serves to distinguish this species from others in the genus

            <p>Etymology.
The male lateral projection of the proctiger in this new species is bifurcated in the middle, giving rise to two different parts, which is a defining character of this species. Hence, the specific epithet ‘ 
<tp:taxon-name>bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
’ is derived from the unique form of the male genitalic structures.

1
) The basal two hair tufts on the male fore femur are similar in both species, but 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
possess two tufts distally, consisting of an acuminate tuft just beyond the central concavity followed by a broad brushy tuft (

), whereas in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>
only the acuminate tuft is present; in addition, the basal section of the male fore femur is more strongly incrassate in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
; 
2
) In 
<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
, the pygophore is much wider than in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>
(

); and 
3
) in lateral view, the more ventral of the two bifurcated lateral arms of the proctiger is very slender in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. dentata</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>A. bifurcata</tp:taxon-name>
; in dorsal and ventral views, by contrast, the shapes of the ventral arms are similar in both species.

Polhemus &amp; Andersen, 
1984</tp:taxon-name>
which is a new record for the state of Himachal Pradesh. The discovery of two new species indicates that the Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri region of West Bengal, which may be considered to be the Himalaya and Himalayan foothills, harbors a rich biodiversity of aquatic and semi-aquatic Heteroptera, some of which are still unknown to science. Our studies highlight that the genus is poorly documented within the Indian subcontinent and that more extensive field surveys are required to understand the distribution and diversity of this genus.
