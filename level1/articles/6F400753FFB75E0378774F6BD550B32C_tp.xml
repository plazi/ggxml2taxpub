New species and new records of the cheilostome bryozoan family 
<tp:taxon-name>Phidoloporidae</tp:taxon-name>
are reported from the poorly studied shelf and continental slope of 
Greenland
. 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella vitta</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
differs from congeners in the shape and size of fenestrulae, the size of autozooids and their arrangement within the colony, features of the orificial complex, including the indistinctly denticulate distal rim, shape of the condyles and height of the peristome, as well as the shape and location of the suboral avicularium, and the morphology of the ovicell. 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella obscura</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
differs from other 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella
species
</tp:taxon-name>
in a unique combination of the following characters: colony surface texture, shape of orifice and condyles, shape of the suboral avicularium, and the morphology of the ovicell. Other specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Greenland
were identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi
(
Nordgaard, 1907
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, firstly recorded in southern and western parts of the study area, and as 
<tp:taxon-name>R. grimaldii
(
Jullien, 1903
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. beaniana
(King, 1846)
</tp:taxon-name>
, previously known only from some localities of western and eastern 
Greenland
and recorded abundantly in 2016. 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella watersi</tp:taxon-name>
specimens from 
Greenland
differ from conspecific material from the 
Faroe Islands
in lacking oral spines and in the size of zooidal characters.

         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Phidoloporidae Gabb &amp; Horn, 1862</tp:taxon-name>
is one of the most diverse families among bryozoans in the World Ocean (Pagès-Escolà 
et al
. 2020), and 
<tp:taxon-name>ReteporellaBusk, 1884</tp:taxon-name>
is the largest genus in the family. 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella</tp:taxon-name>
has been reported from the Arctic to the tropics (
Bock &amp; Gordon 2021
) and currently includes 132 species. Diagnostic features for the genus include a lacy colony, a well-developed peristome with open or closed asymmetric lobes (in the latter case, the sinus becomes an asymmetrically placed spiramen), and an elongate fissure in the ovicell. Adventitious avicularia are also usually numerous on one or both surfaces of the colony (
Busk 1884
).
</p>
         <p>
Despite its high species richness, 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella</tp:taxon-name>
is poorly represented in the Arctic region, with only six species reported to date, namely: 
<tp:taxon-name>R. beaniana
(King, 1846)
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>R. couchii
(Hincks, 1878)
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>R. grimaldii
(
Jullien, 1903
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>R. incognita
(
Hayward &amp; Ryland, 1996
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>R. rara</tp:taxon-name>
(Jullien in 
Jullien &amp; Calvet, 1903
), and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi
(
Nordgaard, 1907
) (

Denisenko 
et al.
2016

)
</tp:taxon-name>
. Of these, 
<tp:taxon-name>R. grimaldii</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. beaniana</tp:taxon-name>
allegedly have a wide geographical occurrence. The eastern distributional boundary of the first nominal species is the deep northern part of the Kara Sea; 
<tp:taxon-name>R. beaniana</tp:taxon-name>
is known from the western shelf edge of the Barents Sea (
Kluge 1962
; 
Denisenko 1990
) and in 
Greenland
waters (Smitt 1968; 
Levinsen 1916
; 
Hansen 1962
). However, the Arctic specimens, collected only from a few localities, have not yet been analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The distribution is restricted to more southerly areas of the Arctic’s Atlantic sector for three of these species. 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella rara</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. couchii</tp:taxon-name>
, initially described from the Azores in the central North Atlantic (
Jullien &amp; Calvet 1903
) and 
Great Britain
(
Hayward &amp; Ryland 1996
), respectively, were also reported from around the Faroe Archipelago (
Hayward 1994
; 
Hayward &amp; Ryland 1996
; 
Klitgaard 1995
), from which 
<tp:taxon-name>R. incognita</tp:taxon-name>
was also originally described but from deeper waters (
Hayward &amp; Ryland 1996
). The latter species, 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
, is widely distributed in the Arctic. It has been reported from the northern part of the 
Greenland
Sea (
Levinsen 1916
; 
Koltun 1964
; 
Kuklinski 2009
), the Arctic basin north of the Franz-Josef Land Archipelago (
Kluge 1962
), and around the Faroe Archipelago (
Hayward 1994
; 

Denisenko 
et al.
2016

). In the high Arctic, it occurs only sporadically, while it was most frequently recorded in the 
Faroe Islands
area (

Denisenko 
et al.
2016

), and in 
Iceland
waters (

Hayward 
et al.
2020

). As for 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella</tp:taxon-name>
from the southern and western parts of the 
Greenland
shelf and continental slope, only two species (i.e. 
<tp:taxon-name>R. beaniana</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. grimaldii</tp:taxon-name>
) have been reported before the present study (Smitt 1867; 
Levinsen 1916
; 
Hansen 1962
).
</p>
         <p>
Among all listed 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, only 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. rara</tp:taxon-name>
have a rough, dimpled texture on the frontal surface of autozooids and the abfrontal surface of the colony (
Nordgaard 1907
; 
Jullien &amp; Calvet 1903
). In 2016, several 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella</tp:taxon-name>
specimens with similar texture were collected at sublittoral and bathyal depths in areas SE, SW, and NW of 
Greenland
.
</p>
         <p>
The aim of this study is to determine their taxonomic identity based on comparisons with related taxa, and to record the distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella
species
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Greenland
waters.

All specimens were initially fixed in 4% formaldehyde and later transferred to 70% ethanol. Several colony fragments were immersed in a sodium hypochlorite solution to remove the cuticles and soft parts, followed by examination under a stereomicroscope. Selected fragments were coated with platinum, and imaged with a QUANTA 250 (FEI) SEM at the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Measurements were taken from SEM images using the software ImageJ (

Schneider 
et al.
2012

). Measurements are presented in millimeters in the text and 
Tables 1–3
; scale bars in the figures are indicated in micrometers. Sample sizes for measurements ranged from 5 to 30 (N).

            <p>Description.
The colony is 
40–50 mm
high, broadly fan-shaped. The fenestrulae are mainly oval, twice as long as wide, commonly 1.1 x 
0.53 mm
(

; 
Table 1
). The trabeculae (0.85 x 
1.05 mm
) consisting of two to three alternating, longitudinal series of autozooids, doubled at points of trabecular bifurcations (

). The abfrontal surface of the colony is densely and finely granulated, covered by flat kenozooids clearly delimited by vibices, and with rare round avicularia (

). One horn-shaped kenozooid (about 
0.5 mm
in length) with a rounded avicularium was observed (

). The granulation on the frontal side is comparatively coarser but less dense than that on the abfrontal surface (

).
</p>
            <p>
Autozooids are elongate hexagonal, delimited by mainly straight edges, and occasionally by sutures, obscured by later calcification; autozooids size is about 0.49 x 
0.275 mm
, but width and length vary considerably especially in areas of bifurcation (

; 
Table 1
). The autozooids have few (2–3) large, distinct marginal pores but zooids located near fenestrulae have an additional row of 5–6 pores near the external edge (

).

            <p>The primary orifice is semicircular with slightly prominent proximal edge, slightly wider than long (mean size 0.094 x 0.100 mm); the distal margin of the orifice is smooth along its upper edge and with well pronounced denticles along its lower margin; condyles are large and rounded. A pair of oral spines is present, one on each side of the orifice at about mid-length.</p>
            <p>
The peristome hides the orifice in frontal view and consists of two unequal lobes forming an open sinus (

). A single circular avicularium is present on its rim, mid-proximally, 
0.041 mm
long, proximally directed and oblique to the frontal surface (

).
</p>
            <p>
The avicularium is immersed in the peristome, the avicularian cystid is invisible, and the distal rim of the mandible is finely toothed. Frontal avicularia are sporadic, oval (0.084 x 
0.053 mm
) demarcated by a raised rim (

); the distal margin of the rostrum is smooth, the mandible is semi-oval, the crossbar is complete without columella, and the distal uncalcified area is semicircular. Abfrontal avicularia are small, nearly circular (diameter 
0.042 mm
); the distal margin of the rostrum is toothed, the mandible is semicircular, and the crossbar is complete without columella.
</p>
            <p>
Ovicells are located above the distal rim of the orifice; ooecia are longer than wide, with an elongate median fissure and a narrow squared labellum; ooecia become partly obscured by secondary calcification in late ontogeny (

            <p>Description.
The colony is reticulate, delicate and shiny. The frontal sides of the autozooids face towards the inner side of the rosette, as it is common in 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella
species.
</tp:taxon-name>
As the colony grows, it develops as asymmetrical lateral lobes that curl outwards and backwards, transforming the colony into a funnel, in which, once the lobes come into contact with each other, the abfrontal side becomes the inner surface of the funnel, and the frontal side its outer surface (

). The colony is up to 60 x 
25 mm
in size; the fenestrulae are large, elongate, rhomboidal, polygonal or oval; their length (
1.9‒2.4 mm
) is twice their width (
0.7‒1.05 mm
).
</p>
            <p>
Both surfaces of the colony (i.e. zooidal frontal shield and the abfrontal surface) are regularly and densely covered by polygonal depressions marked by thin ridges. The abfrontal side is covered with kenozooids delimited by clearly visible vibices. The trabeculae are long (
0.6–1.9 mm
) and narrow (0.24–0.65), consisting of 1–3 alternating longitudinal series of autozooids (

).
</p>
            <p>
Autozooids are elongate, hexagonal; the frontal shield is shiny and slightly convex with wavy edges delimited by sutures, somewhat blurred in zooids with ovicells (

). Autozooids vary considerably in size (
Table 2
) but they are usually about 
0.75–0.85 mm
long by about 
0.25 mm
wide. The dimpled frontal surface bears usually 1‒2 large marginal pores, with or without a low rim.
</p>
            <p>
The primary orifice, partly hidden by the peristome, is semicircular, slightly wider (
0.12 mm
) than long (
0.08 mm
) (

); the proximal edge is straight, the distal margin is smooth along its upper edge, but has a slightly immersed row of minute blunt denticles better pronounced in ovicell-bearing zooids. The condyles are large, blunt, trapezoidal (

), deeply immersed and poorly visible when viewed using a stereomicroscope. Oral spines were not observed in the analyzed specimen.

The peristome hides half of the orifice and consists of two unequal lobes, open or closed, forming in the latter case a small spiramen (

), which often disappears due to progressing calcification, regardless of the location of the zooid in the colony.

) suboral avicularium (about 
0.047 mm
in diameter) with a toothed distal rostrum, complete crossbar without columella, the palate as a narrow shelf, and semicircular mandible (

). The suboral avicularium is generally oriented proximally and obliquely to the colony surface, and its cystid protrudes noticeably. Frontal avicularia are also small, although slightly larger than the suboral ones, oval, 0.083 x 
0.056 mm
, parallel to the frontal surface, with smooth rostrum and complete crossbar, palate as a narrow shelf, uncalcified semicircular area proximal to the crossbar often larger than the distal semi-elliptical one, and semicircular mandible (

). Abfrontal avicularia (

) are small, nearly circular (diameter 
0.042 mm
), with the distal margin of the rostrum toothed, complete crossbar without columella, and semicircular mandible (

).
</p>
            <p>
The ovicell is prominent, the length (
0.235 mm
) slightly greater than the width (
0.228 mm
), its proximal surface is slightly flattened, sometimes with a short, weak labellum, but the labellum is usually lacking. The median fissure closes during ovicell formation, leaving in its place a long, narrow median depression in the proximal half of the ooecium (

).

            <p>Remarks.
Despite the large volume of material processed, the new species 
<tp:taxon-name>R. vitta</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
was found only in one sample. The new species has a dimpled surface as 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. rara</tp:taxon-name>
from the North Atlantic, but in contrast to these species, which have robust colonies and a dull surface (
Jullien &amp; Calvet 1903
; 
Hayward 1994
; 
Hayward &amp; Ryland 1996
, 
1999
), the colony of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. vitta</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
is delicate, shiny and with large fenestrulae. Based on the descriptions by 
Hayward &amp; Ryland (1996
, 
1999
) and 
Jullien &amp; Calvet (1903)
, the fenestrulae in 
<tp:taxon-name>R. vitta</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
are 2.3 times larger than those in

</p>
            <p>
The arrangement of autozooids within the colony also differs among these species. In 
<tp:taxon-name>R. vitta</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
, autozooids form a series of 1–3 rows, remaining constant in width at bifurcations, whereas there are 3–5 rows of autozooids in 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
that double in number at bifurcations.

               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
also differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. rara</tp:taxon-name>
in the size of autozooids (see 
Tables 3
,

<tp:taxon-name>R. vitta</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
are 1.5 times longer than in 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R.rara</tp:taxon-name>
.

The primary orifice in all three species is wider than long, but the proportions are different with the primary orifice of

            <p>Description.
The colony is reticulate, funnel-shaped, thickly calcified, robust and matte, up to 50 x 
40 mm
in size. The branches consist of 3–5 alternate series of zooids, increasing twice in width at points of fusion. Fenestrulae are relatively small, approximately 
0.7‒0.9 mm
long by 
0.2–0.6 mm
wide (

; 
Table 3
). The basal surface is covered by kenozooids delimited by prominent vibices (

); the frontal and abfrontal surfaces are deeply pitted with a honeycomb structure.
</p>
            <p>
Autozooids (L = 
0.35–0.75 mm
; W = 
0.25–0.42 mm
) are located in the inner part of the funnel and delimited by sutures. Several large areolar pores are located near the zooidal margins.
</p>
            <p>
The orifice is wider than long, with a straight proximal margin; the upper distal rim is smooth and with short blunt denticles below (

). The orifice is partly hidden by a peristome, which has two unequal lobes that close to form a circular pseudosinus. The larger lobe bears an oval avicularium directed proximolaterally.
</p>
            <p>
The suboral avicularium is more or less parallel to the zooidal surface with a tall rim, and a few teeth on the distal rostrum; it has a complete crossbar without columella; the palate is a narrow shelf (

). Oral spines were not observed. The frontal avicularia are slightly smaller than the suboral ones, oval or roundish with complete crossbar and no columella.
</p>
            <p>
The ovicell is immersed, longer than wide, with a pronounced quadrate labellum and an elongate median fissure, mostly covered by pitted extrazooidal calcification during ontogeny (

).

            <p>Remarks.
The suite of characters observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
, recently obtained from around 
Greenland
, fits well with previous descriptions of specimens from the Faroe area (cf. 
Hayward 1994
; 
Hayward &amp; Ryland 1996
, 
1999
). Nevertheless, some discrepancies in skeleton morphology were observed, such as the absence of oral spines in our specimens, which were also lacking in the description by 
Kluge (1962)
, as well as in the original description of the species by 
Nordgaard (1907)
. The measurements of the specimens analyzed here are also different from those presented in the literature, where zooids and orifices are narrower.

            <p>Description.
The colony is 
40–50 mm
high, broadly fan-shaped. The fenestrulae are mainly oval, twice as long as wide, commonly 1.1 x 
0.53 mm
(

; 
Table 1
). The trabeculae (0.85 x 
1.05 mm
) consisting of two to three alternating, longitudinal series of autozooids, doubled at points of trabecular bifurcations (

). The abfrontal surface of the colony is densely and finely granulated, covered by flat kenozooids clearly delimited by vibices, and with rare round avicularia (

). One horn-shaped kenozooid (about 
0.5 mm
in length) with a rounded avicularium was observed (

). The granulation on the frontal side is comparatively coarser but less dense than that on the abfrontal surface (

).
</p>
            <p>
Autozooids are elongate hexagonal, delimited by mainly straight edges, and occasionally by sutures, obscured by later calcification; autozooids size is about 0.49 x 
0.275 mm
, but width and length vary considerably especially in areas of bifurcation (

; 
Table 1
). The autozooids have few (2–3) large, distinct marginal pores but zooids located near fenestrulae have an additional row of 5–6 pores near the external edge (

).

            <p>The primary orifice is semicircular with slightly prominent proximal edge, slightly wider than long (mean size 0.094 x 0.100 mm); the distal margin of the orifice is smooth along its upper edge and with well pronounced denticles along its lower margin; condyles are large and rounded. A pair of oral spines is present, one on each side of the orifice at about mid-length.</p>
            <p>
The peristome hides the orifice in frontal view and consists of two unequal lobes forming an open sinus (

). A single circular avicularium is present on its rim, mid-proximally, 
0.041 mm
long, proximally directed and oblique to the frontal surface (

).
</p>
            <p>
The avicularium is immersed in the peristome, the avicularian cystid is invisible, and the distal rim of the mandible is finely toothed. Frontal avicularia are sporadic, oval (0.084 x 
0.053 mm
) demarcated by a raised rim (

); the distal margin of the rostrum is smooth, the mandible is semi-oval, the crossbar is complete without columella, and the distal uncalcified area is semicircular. Abfrontal avicularia are small, nearly circular (diameter 
0.042 mm
); the distal margin of the rostrum is toothed, the mandible is semicircular, and the crossbar is complete without columella.
</p>
            <p>
Ovicells are located above the distal rim of the orifice; ooecia are longer than wide, with an elongate median fissure and a narrow squared labellum; ooecia become partly obscured by secondary calcification in late ontogeny (

).

            <p>Description.
The colony is reticulate, delicate and shiny. The frontal sides of the autozooids face towards the inner side of the rosette, as it is common in 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella
species.
</tp:taxon-name>
As the colony grows, it develops as asymmetrical lateral lobes that curl outwards and backwards, transforming the colony into a funnel, in which, once the lobes come into contact with each other, the abfrontal side becomes the inner surface of the funnel, and the frontal side its outer surface (

). The colony is up to 60 x 
25 mm
in size; the fenestrulae are large, elongate, rhomboidal, polygonal or oval; their length (
1.9‒2.4 mm
) is twice their width (
0.7‒1.05 mm
).
</p>
            <p>
Both surfaces of the colony (i.e. zooidal frontal shield and the abfrontal surface) are regularly and densely covered by polygonal depressions marked by thin ridges. The abfrontal side is covered with kenozooids delimited by clearly visible vibices. The trabeculae are long (
0.6–1.9 mm
) and narrow (0.24–0.65), consisting of 1–3 alternating longitudinal series of autozooids (

).
</p>
            <p>
Autozooids are elongate, hexagonal; the frontal shield is shiny and slightly convex with wavy edges delimited by sutures, somewhat blurred in zooids with ovicells (

). Autozooids vary considerably in size (
Table 2
) but they are usually about 
0.75–0.85 mm
long by about 
0.25 mm
wide. The dimpled frontal surface bears usually 1‒2 large marginal pores, with or without a low rim.
</p>
            <p>
The primary orifice, partly hidden by the peristome, is semicircular, slightly wider (
0.12 mm
) than long (
0.08 mm
) (

); the proximal edge is straight, the distal margin is smooth along its upper edge, but has a slightly immersed row of minute blunt denticles better pronounced in ovicell-bearing zooids. The condyles are large, blunt, trapezoidal (

), deeply immersed and poorly visible when viewed using a stereomicroscope. Oral spines were not observed in the analyzed specimen.

            <p>
The peristome hides half of the orifice and consists of two unequal lobes, open or closed, forming in the latter case a small spiramen (

), which often disappears due to progressing calcification, regardless of the location of the zooid in the colony.
</p>
            <p>
On the larger peristomial lobe there is a small, rounded (

) suboral avicularium (about 
0.047 mm
in diameter) with a toothed distal rostrum, complete crossbar without columella, the palate as a narrow shelf, and semicircular mandible (

). The suboral avicularium is generally oriented proximally and obliquely to the colony surface, and its cystid protrudes noticeably. Frontal avicularia are also small, although slightly larger than the suboral ones, oval, 0.083 x 
0.056 mm
, parallel to the frontal surface, with smooth rostrum and complete crossbar, palate as a narrow shelf, uncalcified semicircular area proximal to the crossbar often larger than the distal semi-elliptical one, and semicircular mandible (

). Abfrontal avicularia (

) are small, nearly circular (diameter 
0.042 mm
), with the distal margin of the rostrum toothed, complete crossbar without columella, and semicircular mandible (

).
</p>
            <p>
The ovicell is prominent, the length (
0.235 mm

0.228 mm

            <p>Remarks.
Despite the large volume of material processed, the new species 
<tp:taxon-name>R. vitta</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
was found only in one sample. The new species has a dimpled surface as 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. rara</tp:taxon-name>
from the North Atlantic, but in contrast to these species, which have robust colonies and a dull surface (
Jullien &amp; Calvet 1903
; 
Hayward 1994
; 
Hayward &amp; Ryland 1996
, 
1999
), the colony of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. vitta</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
is delicate, shiny and with large fenestrulae. Based on the descriptions by 
Hayward &amp; Ryland (1996
, 
1999
) and 
Jullien &amp; Calvet (1903)
, the fenestrulae in 
<tp:taxon-name>R. vitta</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
are 2.3 times larger than those in

The arrangement of autozooids within the colony also differs among these species. In 
<tp:taxon-name>R. vitta</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
, autozooids form a series of 1–3 rows, remaining constant in width at bifurcations, whereas there are 3–5 rows of autozooids in 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
that double in number at bifurcations.

also differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. rara</tp:taxon-name>
in the size of autozooids (see 
Tables 3

            <p>Description.
The colony is reticulate, funnel-shaped, thickly calcified, robust and matte, up to 50 x 
40 mm
in size. The branches consist of 3–5 alternate series of zooids, increasing twice in width at points of fusion. Fenestrulae are relatively small, approximately 
0.7‒0.9 mm
long by 
0.2–0.6 mm
wide (

; 
Table 3
). The basal surface is covered by kenozooids delimited by prominent vibices (

); the frontal and abfrontal surfaces are deeply pitted with a honeycomb structure.
</p>
            <p>
Autozooids (L = 
0.35–0.75 mm
; W = 
0.25–0.42 mm
) are located in the inner part of the funnel and delimited by sutures. Several large areolar pores are located near the zooidal margins.
</p>
            <p>
The orifice is wider than long, with a straight proximal margin; the upper distal rim is smooth and with short blunt denticles below (

). The orifice is partly hidden by a peristome, which has two unequal lobes that close to form a circular pseudosinus. The larger lobe bears an oval avicularium directed proximolaterally.
</p>
            <p>
The suboral avicularium is more or less parallel to the zooidal surface with a tall rim, and a few teeth on the distal rostrum; it has a complete crossbar without columella; the palate is a narrow shelf (

). Oral spines were not observed. The frontal avicularia are slightly smaller than the suboral ones, oval or roundish with complete crossbar and no columella.
</p>
            <p>
The ovicell is immersed, longer than wide, with a pronounced quadrate labellum and an elongate median fissure, mostly covered by pitted extrazooidal calcification during ontogeny (

).

            <p>Remarks.
The suite of characters observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
, recently obtained from around 
Greenland
, fits well with previous descriptions of specimens from the Faroe area (cf. 
Hayward 1994
; 
Hayward &amp; Ryland 1996
, 
1999
). Nevertheless, some discrepancies in skeleton morphology were observed, such as the absence of oral spines in our specimens, which were also lacking in the description by 
Kluge (1962)
, as well as in the original description of the species by 
Nordgaard (1907)
. The measurements of the specimens analyzed here are also different from those presented in the literature, where zooids and orifices are narrower.

            <p>Description.
The colony is 
40–50 mm
high, broadly fan-shaped. The fenestrulae are mainly oval, twice as long as wide, commonly 1.1 x 
0.53 mm
(

; 
Table 1
). The trabeculae (0.85 x 
1.05 mm
) consisting of two to three alternating, longitudinal series of autozooids, doubled at points of trabecular bifurcations (

). The abfrontal surface of the colony is densely and finely granulated, covered by flat kenozooids clearly delimited by vibices, and with rare round avicularia (

). One horn-shaped kenozooid (about 
0.5 mm
in length) with a rounded avicularium was observed (

). The granulation on the frontal side is comparatively coarser but less dense than that on the abfrontal surface (

).
</p>
            <p>
Autozooids are elongate hexagonal, delimited by mainly straight edges, and occasionally by sutures, obscured by later calcification; autozooids size is about 0.49 x 
0.275 mm
, but width and length vary considerably especially in areas of bifurcation (

; 
Table 1
). The autozooids have few (2–3) large, distinct marginal pores but zooids located near fenestrulae have an additional row of 5–6 pores near the external edge (

).

            <p>The primary orifice is semicircular with slightly prominent proximal edge, slightly wider than long (mean size 0.094 x 0.100 mm); the distal margin of the orifice is smooth along its upper edge and with well pronounced denticles along its lower margin; condyles are large and rounded. A pair of oral spines is present, one on each side of the orifice at about mid-length.</p>
            <p>
The peristome hides the orifice in frontal view and consists of two unequal lobes forming an open sinus (

). A single circular avicularium is present on its rim, mid-proximally, 
0.041 mm
long, proximally directed and oblique to the frontal surface (

).
</p>
            <p>
The avicularium is immersed in the peristome, the avicularian cystid is invisible, and the distal rim of the mandible is finely toothed. Frontal avicularia are sporadic, oval (0.084 x 
0.053 mm
) demarcated by a raised rim (

); the distal margin of the rostrum is smooth, the mandible is semi-oval, the crossbar is complete without columella, and the distal uncalcified area is semicircular. Abfrontal avicularia are small, nearly circular (diameter 
0.042 mm
); the distal margin of the rostrum is toothed, the mandible is semicircular, and the crossbar is complete without columella.
</p>
            <p>
Ovicells are located above the distal rim of the orifice; ooecia are longer than wide, with an elongate median fissure and a narrow squared labellum; ooecia become partly obscured by secondary calcification in late ontogeny (

            <p>Description.
The colony is reticulate, delicate and shiny. The frontal sides of the autozooids face towards the inner side of the rosette, as it is common in 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella
species.
</tp:taxon-name>
As the colony grows, it develops as asymmetrical lateral lobes that curl outwards and backwards, transforming the colony into a funnel, in which, once the lobes come into contact with each other, the abfrontal side becomes the inner surface of the funnel, and the frontal side its outer surface (

). The colony is up to 60 x 
25 mm
in size; the fenestrulae are large, elongate, rhomboidal, polygonal or oval; their length (
1.9‒2.4 mm
) is twice their width (
0.7‒1.05 mm
).
</p>
            <p>
Both surfaces of the colony (i.e. zooidal frontal shield and the abfrontal surface) are regularly and densely covered by polygonal depressions marked by thin ridges. The abfrontal side is covered with kenozooids delimited by clearly visible vibices. The trabeculae are long (
0.6–1.9 mm
) and narrow (0.24–0.65), consisting of 1–3 alternating longitudinal series of autozooids (

).
</p>
            <p>
Autozooids are elongate, hexagonal; the frontal shield is shiny and slightly convex with wavy edges delimited by sutures, somewhat blurred in zooids with ovicells (

). Autozooids vary considerably in size (
Table 2
) but they are usually about 
0.75–0.85 mm
long by about 
0.25 mm
wide. The dimpled frontal surface bears usually 1‒2 large marginal pores, with or without a low rim.
</p>
            <p>
The primary orifice, partly hidden by the peristome, is semicircular, slightly wider (
0.12 mm
) than long (
0.08 mm
) (

); the proximal edge is straight, the distal margin is smooth along its upper edge, but has a slightly immersed row of minute blunt denticles better pronounced in ovicell-bearing zooids. The condyles are large, blunt, trapezoidal (

), deeply immersed and poorly visible when viewed using a stereomicroscope. Oral spines were not observed in the analyzed specimen.

            <p>
The peristome hides half of the orifice and consists of two unequal lobes, open or closed, forming in the latter case a small spiramen (

), which often disappears due to progressing calcification, regardless of the location of the zooid in the colony.
</p>
            <p>
On the larger peristomial lobe there is a small, rounded (

) suboral avicularium (about 
0.047 mm
in diameter) with a toothed distal rostrum, complete crossbar without columella, the palate as a narrow shelf, and semicircular mandible (

). The suboral avicularium is generally oriented proximally and obliquely to the colony surface, and its cystid protrudes noticeably. Frontal avicularia are also small, although slightly larger than the suboral ones, oval, 0.083 x 
0.056 mm
, parallel to the frontal surface, with smooth rostrum and complete crossbar, palate as a narrow shelf, uncalcified semicircular area proximal to the crossbar often larger than the distal semi-elliptical one, and semicircular mandible (

). Abfrontal avicularia (

) are small, nearly circular (diameter 
0.042 mm
), with the distal margin of the rostrum toothed, complete crossbar without columella, and semicircular mandible (

).
</p>
            <p>
The ovicell is prominent, the length (
0.235 mm
) slightly greater than the width (
0.228 mm
), its proximal surface is slightly flattened, sometimes with a short, weak labellum, but the labellum is usually lacking. The median fissure closes during ovicell formation, leaving in its place a long, narrow median depression in the proximal half of the ooecium (

).

               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
is delicate, shiny and with large fenestrulae. Based on the descriptions by 
Hayward &amp; Ryland (1996

Jullien &amp; Calvet (1903)
, the fenestrulae in 
<tp:taxon-name>R. vitta</tp:taxon-name>

are 2.3 times larger than those in

The arrangement of autozooids within the colony also differs among these species. In 
<tp:taxon-name>R. vitta</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
, autozooids form a series of 1–3 rows, remaining constant in width at bifurcations, whereas there are 3–5 rows of autozooids in 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
that double in number at bifurcations.

also differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. rara</tp:taxon-name>
in the size of autozooids (see 
Tables 3
,

). For instance, the autozooids in 
<tp:taxon-name>R. vitta</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
are 1.5 times longer than in

            <p>Description.
The colony is reticulate, funnel-shaped, thickly calcified, robust and matte, up to 50 x 
40 mm
in size. The branches consist of 3–5 alternate series of zooids, increasing twice in width at points of fusion. Fenestrulae are relatively small, approximately 
0.7‒0.9 mm
long by 
0.2–0.6 mm
wide (

; 
Table 3
). The basal surface is covered by kenozooids delimited by prominent vibices (

); the frontal and abfrontal surfaces are deeply pitted with a honeycomb structure.
</p>
            <p>
Autozooids (L = 
0.35–0.75 mm
; W = 
0.25–0.42 mm
) are located in the inner part of the funnel and delimited by sutures. Several large areolar pores are located near the zooidal margins.
</p>
            <p>
The orifice is wider than long, with a straight proximal margin; the upper distal rim is smooth and with short blunt denticles below (

). The orifice is partly hidden by a peristome, which has two unequal lobes that close to form a circular pseudosinus. The larger lobe bears an oval avicularium directed proximolaterally.
</p>
            <p>
The suboral avicularium is more or less parallel to the zooidal surface with a tall rim, and a few teeth on the distal rostrum; it has a complete crossbar without columella; the palate is a narrow shelf (

). Oral spines were not observed. The frontal avicularia are slightly smaller than the suboral ones, oval or roundish with complete crossbar and no columella.
</p>
            <p>
The ovicell is immersed, longer than wide, with a pronounced quadrate labellum and an elongate median fissure, mostly covered by pitted extrazooidal calcification during ontogeny (

).

            <p>Remarks.
The suite of characters observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
, recently obtained from around 
Greenland
, fits well with previous descriptions of specimens from the Faroe area (cf. 
Hayward 1994
; 
Hayward &amp; Ryland 1996
, 
1999
). Nevertheless, some discrepancies in skeleton morphology were observed, such as the absence of oral spines in our specimens, which were also lacking in the description by 
Kluge (1962)
, as well as in the original description of the species by 
Nordgaard (1907)
. The measurements of the specimens analyzed here are also different from those presented in the literature, where zooids and orifices are narrower.

            <p>Description.
The colony is 
40–50 mm
high, broadly fan-shaped. The fenestrulae are mainly oval, twice as long as wide, commonly 1.1 x 
0.53 mm
(

; 
Table 1
). The trabeculae (0.85 x 
1.05 mm
) consisting of two to three alternating, longitudinal series of autozooids, doubled at points of trabecular bifurcations (

). The abfrontal surface of the colony is densely and finely granulated, covered by flat kenozooids clearly delimited by vibices, and with rare round avicularia (

). One horn-shaped kenozooid (about 
0.5 mm
in length) with a rounded avicularium was observed (

). The granulation on the frontal side is comparatively coarser but less dense than that on the abfrontal surface (

).
</p>
            <p>
Autozooids are elongate hexagonal, delimited by mainly straight edges, and occasionally by sutures, obscured by later calcification; autozooids size is about 0.49 x 
0.275 mm
, but width and length vary considerably especially in areas of bifurcation (

; 
Table 1
). The autozooids have few (2–3) large, distinct marginal pores but zooids located near fenestrulae have an additional row of 5–6 pores near the external edge (

).

            <p>The primary orifice is semicircular with slightly prominent proximal edge, slightly wider than long (mean size 0.094 x 0.100 mm); the distal margin of the orifice is smooth along its upper edge and with well pronounced denticles along its lower margin; condyles are large and rounded. A pair of oral spines is present, one on each side of the orifice at about mid-length.</p>
            <p>
The peristome hides the orifice in frontal view and consists of two unequal lobes forming an open sinus (

). A single circular avicularium is present on its rim, mid-proximally, 
0.041 mm
long, proximally directed and oblique to the frontal surface (

).
</p>
            <p>
The avicularium is immersed in the peristome, the avicularian cystid is invisible, and the distal rim of the mandible is finely toothed. Frontal avicularia are sporadic, oval (0.084 x 
0.053 mm
) demarcated by a raised rim (

); the distal margin of the rostrum is smooth, the mandible is semi-oval, the crossbar is complete without columella, and the distal uncalcified area is semicircular. Abfrontal avicularia are small, nearly circular (diameter 
0.042 mm
); the distal margin of the rostrum is toothed, the mandible is semicircular, and the crossbar is complete without columella.
</p>
            <p>
Ovicells are located above the distal rim of the orifice; ooecia are longer than wide, with an elongate median fissure and a narrow squared labellum; ooecia become partly obscured by secondary calcification in late ontogeny (

).

            <p>Description.
The colony is reticulate, delicate and shiny. The frontal sides of the autozooids face towards the inner side of the rosette, as it is common in 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella
species.
</tp:taxon-name>
As the colony grows, it develops as asymmetrical lateral lobes that curl outwards and backwards, transforming the colony into a funnel, in which, once the lobes come into contact with each other, the abfrontal side becomes the inner surface of the funnel, and the frontal side its outer surface (

). The colony is up to 60 x 
25 mm
in size; the fenestrulae are large, elongate, rhomboidal, polygonal or oval; their length (
1.9‒2.4 mm
) is twice their width (
0.7‒1.05 mm
).
</p>
            <p>
Both surfaces of the colony (i.e. zooidal frontal shield and the abfrontal surface) are regularly and densely covered by polygonal depressions marked by thin ridges. The abfrontal side is covered with kenozooids delimited by clearly visible vibices. The trabeculae are long (
0.6–1.9 mm
) and narrow (0.24–0.65), consisting of 1–3 alternating longitudinal series of autozooids (

).
</p>
            <p>
Autozooids are elongate, hexagonal; the frontal shield is shiny and slightly convex with wavy edges delimited by sutures, somewhat blurred in zooids with ovicells (

). Autozooids vary considerably in size (
Table 2
) but they are usually about 
0.75–0.85 mm
long by about 
0.25 mm
wide. The dimpled frontal surface bears usually 1‒2 large marginal pores, with or without a low rim.
</p>
            <p>
The primary orifice, partly hidden by the peristome, is semicircular, slightly wider (
0.12 mm
) than long (
0.08 mm
) (

); the proximal edge is straight, the distal margin is smooth along its upper edge, but has a slightly immersed row of minute blunt denticles better pronounced in ovicell-bearing zooids. The condyles are large, blunt, trapezoidal (

), deeply immersed and poorly visible when viewed using a stereomicroscope. Oral spines were not observed in the analyzed specimen.

            <p>
The peristome hides half of the orifice and consists of two unequal lobes, open or closed, forming in the latter case a small spiramen (

), which often disappears due to progressing calcification, regardless of the location of the zooid in the colony.
</p>
            <p>
On the larger peristomial lobe there is a small, rounded (

) suboral avicularium (about 
0.047 mm
in diameter) with a toothed distal rostrum, complete crossbar without columella, the palate as a narrow shelf, and semicircular mandible (

). The suboral avicularium is generally oriented proximally and obliquely to the colony surface, and its cystid protrudes noticeably. Frontal avicularia are also small, although slightly larger than the suboral ones, oval, 0.083 x 
0.056 mm
, parallel to the frontal surface, with smooth rostrum and complete crossbar, palate as a narrow shelf, uncalcified semicircular area proximal to the crossbar often larger than the distal semi-elliptical one, and semicircular mandible (

). Abfrontal avicularia (

) are small, nearly circular (diameter 
0.042 mm
), with the distal margin of the rostrum toothed, complete crossbar without columella, and semicircular mandible (

).
</p>
            <p>
The ovicell is prominent, the length (
0.235 mm
) slightly greater than the width (
0.228 mm
), its proximal surface is slightly flattened, sometimes with a short, weak labellum, but the labellum is usually lacking. The median fissure closes during ovicell formation, leaving in its place a long, narrow median depression in the proximal half of the ooecium (

).

<tp:taxon-name>R. vitta</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">n. sp.</named-content>
, autozooids form a series of 1–3 rows, remaining constant in width at bifurcations, whereas there are 3–5 rows of autozooids in 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
that double in number at bifurcations.

also differs from

and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. rara</tp:taxon-name>
in the size of autozooids (see

            <p>Description.
The colony is reticulate, funnel-shaped, thickly calcified, robust and matte, up to 50 x 
40 mm
in size. The branches consist of 3–5 alternate series of zooids, increasing twice in width at points of fusion. Fenestrulae are relatively small, approximately 
0.7‒0.9 mm
long by 
0.2–0.6 mm
wide (

; 
Table 3
). The basal surface is covered by kenozooids delimited by prominent vibices (

); the frontal and abfrontal surfaces are deeply pitted with a honeycomb structure.
</p>
            <p>
Autozooids (L = 
0.35–0.75 mm
; W = 
0.25–0.42 mm
) are located in the inner part of the funnel and delimited by sutures. Several large areolar pores are located near the zooidal margins.
</p>
            <p>
The orifice is wider than long, with a straight proximal margin; the upper distal rim is smooth and with short blunt denticles below (

). The orifice is partly hidden by a peristome, which has two unequal lobes that close to form a circular pseudosinus. The larger lobe bears an oval avicularium directed proximolaterally.
</p>
            <p>
The suboral avicularium is more or less parallel to the zooidal surface with a tall rim, and a few teeth on the distal rostrum; it has a complete crossbar without columella; the palate is a narrow shelf (

). Oral spines were not observed. The frontal avicularia are slightly smaller than the suboral ones, oval or roundish with complete crossbar and no columella.
</p>
            <p>
The ovicell is immersed, longer than wide, with a pronounced quadrate labellum and an elongate median fissure, mostly covered by pitted extrazooidal calcification during ontogeny (

).

Kluge (1962)
, as well as in the original description of the species by 
Nordgaard (1907)
. The measurements of the specimens analyzed here are also different from those presented in the literature, where zooids and orifices are narrower.

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>
Representatives of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella</tp:taxon-name>
are easily recognized by the distinctive appearance of their colonies, implying that the genus could be well studied not only in the World Ocean (
Bock &amp; Gordon 2021
), but also in the Arctic region. Indeed, since the second half of the 19 
th
century, records of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. beaniana</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. grimaldii</tp:taxon-name>
in the Atlantic Arctic have regularly appeared (i.e. 
Smitt 1868
; 
Levinsen 1916
; 
Osburn 1919
; 
Kluge 1962
). In the 1990s, following the exploration in the 1980s of poorly known areas around the 
Faroe Islands
, it has been established that the diversity of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella</tp:taxon-name>
in the Arctic was higher than previously thought. 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella couchii</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. rara</tp:taxon-name>
, previously recorded in temperate Atlantic waters, were reported for the first time in the zone of interaction between water masses from the Arctic and Atlantic, and a new species 
<tp:taxon-name>R. incognita</tp:taxon-name>
was also discovered (
Hayward 1994
; 
Hayward &amp; Ryland 1996
; 
Klitgaard 1995
). However, the record of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. rara</tp:taxon-name>
in the Faroes waters by 
Klitgaard (1995)
seems doubtful given that the species was originally described from the central North Atlantic archipelago of the Azores (
Jullien &amp; Calvet 1903
), which is located considerably south of the Faroes. The species could have been confused with 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
The processing of new bryozoan samples collected in 
Greenland
waters in 2016 has allowed to establish that the diversity of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella</tp:taxon-name>
in the study area is one of the richest in comparison to other Arctic areas (
Kluge 1962
; 
Denisenko 1990
; 
Kuklinski 2009
). The present study also states that 
<tp:taxon-name>R. beaniana</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. grimaldii</tp:taxon-name>
commonly occur in the study area, suggesting that these species distribution, although common in the Arctic, is limited mainly by spreading of the intermediate Atlantic water masses (
Puerta et al. 2020
) (

).
</p>
         <p>
The intensive sampling undertaken in 2016 indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella watersi</tp:taxon-name>
, which was previously reported from 
Greenland
waters but only northward of 
78° N
(
Koltun 1964
; 
Kuklinski 2009
), inhabit also in the southern and western parts of the study area. Frequent records of the species in similar latitudes near 
Iceland
(

Hayward 
et al.
2020

) and 
Faroe Islands
(

Denisenko 
et al.
2016

) already suggested that it should also inhabit the southern waters of 
Greenland
. However, in contrast to the neighboring areas, the species occurs less frequently in the study area, where it was found only at three locations (

).
</p>
         <p>
The suite of characters observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
recently obtained from around 
Greenland
fit well with descriptions in some of the latest publications (cf. 
Hayward 1994
; 
Hayward &amp; Ryland 1996
, 
1999
), but at the same time, there are some discrepancies related to zooidal morphometrics and the absence of proximal oral spines, which were also lacking in specimens described by 
Nordgaard (1907)
and by 
Kluge (1962)
. These observations suggest that 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by intraspecific variability within the Arctic as a result of specific environmental differences between typical Arctic areas and areas at the border between the temperate Atlantic and the Arctic, from which the specimens analyzed in previous studies (
Hayward 1994
; 
Hayward &amp; Ryland 1996
, 
1999
) were collected.
</p>
         <p>
Based on the distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella
species
</tp:taxon-name>
in the Arctic, we can speculate that they derive from deep central Atlantic species, analogously to some other predominantly Arctic bryozoan genera, e.g. 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudoflustra
(

Kuklinski 
et al.
2013

)
</tp:taxon-name>
. This speculation is supported by the results of studies on population genetics of other Arctic biota, including algae, gastropods and crustaceans (

Maggs 
et al.
2008

). The spreading of Atlantic species such as 
<tp:taxon-name>R. beaniana</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>R. grimaldii</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>R. watersi</tp:taxon-name>
towards the higher latitudes of the 
Greenland
Sea up to the Arctic Basin took place after the deglaciation of the Arctic about 10,000 years ago. The system of water currents established during that time promoted and supports the bryozoan distribution towards the north, northeast and north-west (
Nesis 1983
), including the western areas of 
Greenland
.
</p>
         <p>
Based on the results of the present study confirming the existence of new species and new records of 
<tp:taxon-name>Reteporella</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Greenland
waters, we can conclude that the diversity of this group in this area of Arctic is really higher than hitherto recognized (
Denisenko &amp; Blicher 2021
). Those findings also support our previous conclusion that the fauna of bryozoans in the Arctic as a whole remains underestimated (
Denisenko 2020
).
