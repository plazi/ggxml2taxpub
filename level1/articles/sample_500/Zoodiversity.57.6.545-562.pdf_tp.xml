, taking into account global climate change. The model showed that climatic conditions in 
Ukraine
meet the requirements of the species in the European part of its range, considering various indicators such as the sum of active temperatures, mean annual temperature and precipitation. The whole territory of 
Ukraine
could potentially be a range for 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
due to suitable climatic conditions and the presence of host plants, with Zakarpattia, 
Crimea
and the Wood-and-Steppe and Steppe zones of

being the most favourable. Current phytosanitary measures are not sufficient to prevent its spread and a pest management system is needed to reduce the damage. The parasitoid

Introduction
</title>
         <p>

The citrus flatid planthopper, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Metcalfa pruinosa
(Say, 1830)
</tp:taxon-name>
, is one of the most important invasive species in Europe. 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
originates from 
North America
, where the insects are widespread in various climatic zones from 
Texas and Florida
through the eastern United States to southern 
Ontario and Quebec
in 
Canada
. Accidentally introduced from 
North America
to 
Italy
in 1979 (

), 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
spread rapidly and is now present in almost all European countries (
<tp:taxon-name>Metcalfa</tp:taxon-name>
…, 2023). The citrus flatid planthopper damages important agricultural crops and fruit trees directly through phloem feeding, or indirectly by contaminating plant surfaces with waxy secretions and honeydew that induce sooty mold development, and by transmitting dangerous plant pathogens (

; 

; 

; 

; 

)

.
</p>
         <p>
The invasion of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
has been recorded in the following countries and territories of Eurasia: 
Albania
, 
Austria
, Azerbaijan, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina
, 
Bulgaria
, 
Croatia
, 
Czechia
, 
France
, Georgia, 
Germany
, 
Gibraltar
, 
Greece
, 
Hungary
, 
Italy
, 
Moldova
, 
Montenegro
, 
Poland
, 
Romania
, 
Russia
, 
Serbia
, 
Slovakia
, 
Slovenia
, 
South Korea
, 
Spain
, 
Switzerland
, 
Turkey
, 
Ukraine
(

; 

; 

; 

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
was recorded in 
Great Britain
in 1994, but the invasive population was successfully eradicated (

). The general distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Metcalfa pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
is shown in 
figure 1.
</p>
         <p>
A study of the likelihood of naturalisation and spread of the citrus flatid planthopper in European countries has shown that it was first found in nurseries and open centres of ornamental horticulture, indicating that these pests is introduced into new areas through the sale of plants for planting (

). The pest lays its eggs under the bark, where they are well protected during the winter. Therefore, the high survival rate of insects at the egg stage during transport and storage of plants is very likely. Another likely way for the insect to enter new territories is through the use of vehicles. 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
has been found along roads, bus routes, motorways, and car parks in several European countries. Passive dispersal of insects due to tourist travel in European countries during the summer holiday season can also be considered as a secondary dispersal route (

).
</p>
         <p>

The first record of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Ukraine
was made in 2011, when single specimens were found on the ailanthus (
Ailanthus altissima
(Mill.) Swingle) in 
Odesa
(

). A stable pest population formed in the 
Ovidiopol District
of the 
Odesa Region
, which was detected during the inspection of plantings of fruit, ornamental and vegetable crops (

). Since the first reports of its appearance in 2011, the citrus flatid planthopper has rapidly acclimatized and spread in 
Ukraine
, causing severe damage to various agricultural crops (

; 

). Incursions of the citrus flatid planthopper have been found in the cities of 
Donetsk
(

), Simferopol (

), 
Kyiv
(

; 

), in Vynogradiv and Uzhgorod districts of the Zakarpattia Region, and in 
Kharkiv
and 
Dnipropetrovsk
Regions (UkrBIN, 2023). Currently, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
has been recorded in ten regions of 
Ukraine
(
fig. 2
), but the pest may also occur in other areas, e. g. in 
Rivne Region
(
M. R. Khomych
, pers. com., 2022)

.
</p>
         <p>
Such simultaneous detection of the pest in different areas of the country can cause rapid spread of this phytophagous species and requires rapid development of the control system and measures to prevent its spread, which should be based on the forecast of the possibility of acclimatisation and determination of a potential distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Ukraine
. It is known that the cause of the spread of phytophagous species and changes in their range is primarily unintentional human activities and global climate changes. One of the main requirements for the establishment of a species in a new area is the correspondence of climatic conditions with those requirements of the existing area. For this purpose, the analysis of climatic 
types
of the European part and 
Ukraine
for the range of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
was carried out.
</p>
         <p>
Since 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
has more than 300 species of host plants in Europe (

), it may be recorded in all regions of 
Ukraine
with suitable environmental conditions for the species (especially climatic and bionomic [availability of host plants]). On the territory of the M. M. Hryshko National Botanical Garden, NASU (
Kyiv
) 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
damages 80 plant species of 55 families (

). The high ecological plasticity of the citrus flatid planthopper can represent a phytosanitary danger.
</p>
         <p>
The occurrence of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Ukraine
and the high potential harmfulness of this species cause the necessity to identify the territories of 
Ukraine
suitable for further spread and establishment of this pest and to determine the potential area within the framework of the Phytosanitary Risk Analysis (PRA) procedure based on GIS modelling using modern software and bioclimatic predictors. Bioclimatic modelling has been successfully used for other invasive species in 
Ukraine
, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Diabrotica virgifera virgifera
Le Conte, 1858
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oemona hirta
(Fabricius, 1775)
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thaumatotibia leucotreta
(Meyrick, 1913)
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
Grapevine roditis leaf discoloration-associated virus
(

; 

, 

).
</p>
         <p>
Technologies of ecological and geographical analysis and modelling of the distribution of biological objects are widely used in the world to make predictions about the distribution of harmful objects. Several models have been used by researchers to predict the spread of the citrus psyllid beyond its existing range. In 
Austria
, the CLIMEX programme was used to determine the geography of the potential distribution of the accidentally introduced 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
in Europe and the areas of phytosanitary risk. The zones with the most suitable climate for the development of the pest and the risk of its introduction were identified (

). CLIMEX software was used to predict the spread of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
South Korea
(

) and on a global scale (

). MaxEnt algorithm was used to model the process of pest range expansion and predicted the potential spread of this species in the 
Republic of Korea
(

).
</p>
         <p>
Chemical control of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
is difficult because this species is polyphagous, its nymphs have a prolonged hatching period and are covered by the waxy secretion during development, in addition, treatment with the pesticides effective against 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
could cause additional ecological problems in urban and agroecosystems (

). One of the solutions for the regulation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
is biocontrol with its natural enemy, the parasitoid 
<tp:taxon-name>
Neodryinus typhlocybae
(Ashmead, 1893)
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Hymenoptera</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Dryinidae</tp:taxon-name>
). This species also originates from North America and is now spreading in Europe (

). A targeted search for 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. typhlocybae
</tp:taxon-name>
is highly recommended in those regions where 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
is present and has been established, but 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. typhlocybae
</tp:taxon-name>
has not yet been recorded (

). GIS modelling could help to assess the suitability of the territory of 
Ukraine
for 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. typhlocybae
</tp:taxon-name>
and facilitate further search for this parasitoid in our country.
</p>
         <p>
Our research is focused on identifying the potential range of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
on the territory of 
Ukraine
and the bioclimatic factors contributing to the spread of the pest, as well as assessing the suitability of different areas of 
Ukraine
for 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
and its natural enemy, 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. typhlocybae
</tp:taxon-name>
, in the perspective of climate change and the possibilities of using this entomophage for classical biocontrol of the citrus flatid planthopper.

Identification of the potential range of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Ukraine
was carried out using the computer programs AgroAtlas (

), MapInfo Pro15.0 (ESTIMap 
®
), and IDRISI Selva (Clark Labs 
®
), which allow to create predictive maps of the spread of adventitious organisms in an automated mode (

; Titova &amp; Klechkovskyi, 2014; 

).
</p>
         <p>For this purpose, several consecutive operations were performed:</p>
         <p>
1. Construction of the vector map of the European part of the range of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
in the MapInfo
</p>
         <p>Pro15.0.</p>
         <p>
2. Export of the constructed vector map of the European part of the range of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
to the program IDRISI Selva.
</p>
         <p>3. Determination of the average multi-year indicators of climatic factors in different parts of the European range on world climate maps (average annual temperature, sum of active temperature — SAT</p>
         <p>
(˃ 10 
оC
), temperatures of the warmest and coldest months, average annual precipitation).
</p>
         <p>4. Determination of maximum and minimum indicators in the quantitative amplitudes of each of the limiting factors.</p>
         <p>
5. Determination of the suitability of the climatic conditions of the territory of 
Ukraine
for the existence of the species for each of the individual climatic indicators.
</p>
         <p>6. Construction of vector maps of ecologically suitable areas for each of the limiting factors on the climatic maps of AgroAtlas.</p>
         <p>
Construction of the map of the potential range of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Ukraine
, by the operation of superimposing of three vector maps of ecologically suitable areas as a result of which the area suitable for the existence of the species is determined by a set of climatic factors.
</p>
         <p>
Long-term mean values of climate indicators in different parts of the European range of the pest were determined on world climate maps, and maximum and minimum values of quantitative amplitudes for each of the limiting factors were determined. The data of the conducted GIS analysis were used to determine the acceptable climatic conditions in 
Ukraine
for the existence of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
and to construct vector maps of ecologically suitable areas for each of the limiting factors. The maximum and minimum values of ecological amplitudes in the European part of the range were used (
table 1
).
</p>
         <p>
The creation of a digital vector map of the potential area, carried out usi ng of the AgroAtlas, MapInfo Pro 15.0, and IDRISI SELVA software, allows the climatic acceptability of the territory of 
Ukraine
for 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinose
</tp:taxon-name>
to be represented graphically. At the same time, the subjective factor is completely excluded, since the boundaries of the area are determined by the program on the the basis of biological characteristics of the object.
</p>
         <p>The IDRISI SELVA program eliminates areas that do not meet the required parameters, which allows to systematize all data and to clearly predict possible areas of acclimatization and spread of the pest. Areas that are not suitable for the existence of the species are coloured black, while areas that are suitable for each of the analyzed climatic factors and potential range are coloured by the program.</p>

Data preparation. To perform the modelling, we reduced the sample of the species occurrence data. First of all, we discarded points for which the coordinate accuracy was too low, in particular, we excluded all occurrences for which in GBIF the coordinate uncertainty was greater than 
4.63 km
, in order to correlate the spatial resolution of the occurrence points with the chosen spatial resolution of the layers of bioclimatic factors (2.5 minutes). After this manipulation we received 8946 occurrences. Then, using the spThin package in R, we reduced the sample to keep only the points that were at least 
10 km
apart. Finally, we obtained a data set with 2292 occurrences for modelling (
fig. 3
).

in a current and future climate was conducted using Maximum Entropy modelling (

) in MaxEnt, version 3.4.3. with default settings. We used 19 bioclimatic variables of historical climate data (1970- 2000) (

) and future climate CMIP6 model CanESM5-CanOE (2024-2060) (WorldClim. org, accessed 
March 1, 2023
) with spatial resolution 2.5 minutes and the shared socio-economic pathway (ssp) 245. The results were represented using the logistic threshold output format. Received maps were then processed in QGis 3.28.4-Firenze (

         <p>
Model analysis. To assess model quality, we used built-in measures such as omission rate and area under the 
ROC
curve (AUC). For the analysis of variable contributions, we used data on percent contribution, permutation importance, and performed the jackknife test. We considered that characteristics such as percent contribution should be interpreted with caution (

The constructed vector maps show that the climatic conditions throughout 
Ukraine
meet the living conditions of the species by a number of indicators: the sum of active temperatures (SAT10), the multi-year average annual temperature, the multi-year average annual temperatures of the coldest (January) and warmest (July) month, the average annual amount of precipitation (

         <p>Six bioclimatic factors accounted for 95 % of percentage contribution in building of the model: bio 17 (34.8), bio 14 (27.0), bio 5 (12.3), bio 4 (10.4), bio 12 (6.3), bio 10 (4.2). At the same time the 94 % of the permutation importance was due to the following six bioclimatic factors: bio 10 (55.3), bio 17 (23.5), bio 4 (5.3), bio 12 (3.6), bio 11 (3.5), bio 5 (2.8). As we can see bio 17, bio 10, bio 4, bio 12 contributed in both characteristics, while bio 17 (Precipitation of Driest Quarter) has the highest value in the percentage contribution, and bio 10 (Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter) has the highest value in the permutation importance (table 3).</p>
         <p>The jackknife test of variable importance showed that the environmental variable with highest gain when used in isolation was bio 17, which therefore appears to have the most useful information by itself, and the environmental variable that decreases the gain the most when it is omitted is bio 10, which therefore appears to have the most information that isn’t present in the other variables.</p>

At the same time 97 % of permutation importance was due to following ten bioclimatic factors: bio 6 (39.3), bio 15 (33.3), bio 10 (9.0), bio 18 (4.3), bio 11 (3.9), bio 8 (2.5), bio 2 (1.5), bio 13</p>

, the suitability of the territories in

regions in the north, areas in the centre, northeast and southeast is increasing. The suitability also increases partly in

Discussion
</title>
         <p>
The territory of 
Ukraine
is in general moderately suitable for the existence of the citrus flatid planthopper, due to the characteristics of Ukrainian climate (

; 

; 
Ukraine
…, 2023) that meets physiological demands of the species (

). Nevertheless, under current climatic conditions the territory of the Wood-and-Steppe and Steppe zones (except for the part of the Black Sea Lowland), Zakarpattia Region, and 
Crimea
are more suitable for 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
than other territories. Under future climatic conditions used in the study the most appropriate areas for the citrus flatid planthopper largely stay consistent, with a slight enhancement in suitability observed in the northern areas. This trend corresponds with the results of 

, who showed that the distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
would likely shift northward across North America and Europe. Also, under future climatic conditions, a redistribution of more favourable areas is evident: suitability becomes more uniform, indicated by decreasing grid cell values and an increase in the area that better matches the ecological preferences of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
. Such potential decrease of suitability of the territory in future was as well shown for 
South Korea
, that was explained by the temperature increase due to climate change (

).
</p>
         <p>The important influence of temperature can also be seen from the analysis of the factors in MaxEnt: the Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter (bio 10) is the main contributor in the model permutation importance. Another important factor is the Precipitation of Driest Quarter (bio 17) that has the highest value in percentage contribution in the model. These two factors were distinguished by all methods of variable contribution analysis, including jack knife. The following factors as Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter (bio 11), Max Temperature of Warmest Month (bio 5), Temperature Seasonality (bio 4), as well as Annual Precipitation (bio 12) also play an important role.</p>
         <p>
Abiotic factors of the environment have a significant effect on the citrus flatid planthopper. Studies have shown that day and night air temperatures, the amount of precipitation and their duration were crucial in the rate of insect development (

; 

; 

). The development of the pest is limited by a minimum and maximum air temperature. The minimum threshold defined by G. 

is 13°C according to observed distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
in North America. Study based in 
Kyiv
showed that temperature of 17–20 °C in May and August–September can limit the development of the citrus flatid planthopper, while the first imagoes rear at minimum night temperature 22 °C (

), that corresponds with the lower optimal temperature of 22 °C found by G. 

. The maximum temperature threshold for 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
development is 31 °C (

), that is why the Max Temperature of Warmest Month (bio 5) is also a very important factor, that was confirmed by our study and by 

, who also used MaxEnt. This could explain why our model predicts a decrease in suitability for 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Crimea
, which already has high subtropical temperatures (

).
</p>
         <p>

The annual precipitation affects the 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
less than some other temperature or precipitation indicators, because according to this factor, most suitable areas should be located in the west and northwest of 
Ukraine
and in the Carpathians, however, according to our modelling results it is not so. 

showed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
has a limited distribution in dry regions, however, Kushnir and Bondareva (2021) reported that heavy rains together with lowering of the temperature could lead to rapid decrease of species population that was observed in 


July–August 
2019

in the 

M. M. 
Gryshko National Botanical Garden

of 
National Academy of Sciences
of 
Ukraine
in 
Kyiv
. 
Modelling
of global geographic distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
using CLIMEX (

) showed that ecoclimatic index and, therefore, probability of species distribution was higher in western part of 
Ukraine
then in the south or east, however, the region of 
Carpathians
and 
Volyn Region
were marked as less suitable. 
Our
research shows that 
Northern
and 
Western
Ukraine
(except Zakarpattia Region) is less suitable for 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
then south and south-east territories, although due to predicted climate changes, the suitability of the territory of 
Volyn
, 
Kyiv
, parts of 
Rivne
, 
Zhytomyr
and 
Chernihiv
regions will somewhat increase. 
We
assume the use of another set of predictors with different spatial resolutions as well as another modelling method could explain this difference, and it should be noted that maps obtained by 
Byeon
and coauthors were quite generalized and not specifically paid attention to the territory of 
Ukraine
, but rather trying to show main world trends. 
Among
the factors associated with precipitation, according to our data, an important role is played by the 
Precipitation of Driest Quarter
(bio 17), which apparently works as a limiting factor together with the 
Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter
(bio 10)

.
</p>
         <p>
It is worth noting that the predicted probability of finding 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
is at the medium level, in particular, the value does not exceed 0.52, which may mean that other factors that were not included in the analysis also affect the spread of the citrus planthopper. These may be anthropogenic factors, such as the spread with transport and plant material (

). Modelling results of spreading 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
South Korea
, conducted with the help of MaxEnt, justified that the rapid spread of the pests besides ecological factors is strongly connected with anthropogenic factors (

).
</p>
         <p>
Biotic factors are important as well. The wide range of citrus flatid planthopper host plants also serves as reserves for this invader species, with only woody plants serving as overwintering sites (

), so forest strips play an important role for overwintering and subsequent increase in 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
populations, especially on field crops. This is also a favourable factor for the spread of citrus flatid planthopper in the Wood-and-Steppe zone of 
Ukraine
.
</p>
         <p>
The areas we have identified as favourable for the citrus flatid planthopper settlement are precisely those regions where horticulture and viticulture are developed in 
Ukraine
(Plant Growing…, 2021). Accordingly, attention should be paid to controlling 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
in these regions to reduce potential damage to orchards and vineyards.
</p>
         <p>
One of the methods of controlling 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
is the possibility of biological control with the help of a natural enemy, the parasitoid 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. typhlocybae
</tp:taxon-name>
, which is recommended as a biological control agent (

, 

). This species is actively spreading in Europe, in 2022 it was reported from 
Poland
(

), but has not yet been registered in 
Ukraine
. MaxEnt modelling has shown that the territory of 
Ukraine
is suitable for the parasitoid, albeit unevenly. There are prospects for the introduction and use of this parasitoid, especially in the south of 
Ukraine
, and this is very useful, because it is in the south that there are favourable conditions for 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
as well. In the context of climate change, the area of favourable areas for the parasitoid is increasing, although there is a certain redistribution of suitability. The following factors play a major role in the spread of the parasitoid: bio 15 (Precipitation Seasonality), bio 6 (Min Temperature of Coldest Month), bio 17 (Precipitation of Driest Quarter).
</p>
         <p>The best way to minimize damage from invasive species is to prevent their invasion, since it is extremely difficult to eliminate already dispersed species. As a result, many countries are looking for ways to prevent the invasions through initial monitoring. Because geospatial modelling has already been successfully used in many countries and has been widely used to predict the spread of invasive species, these programs can be recommended as an effective tool for preventive monitoring for early detection and rapid response to alien species, as well as for developing models for predicting migration, dispersal and spread of invasive species caused by climate change.</p>

Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
For the first time in 
Ukraine
, the risk of spreading 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
beyond its identified habitats has been identified, which is determined by the presence of a wide range of host plants and climatic conditions that meet the requirements of the species. Existing phytosanitary measures cannot at present reliably prevent the risk of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
spreading in 
Ukraine
.
</p>
         <p>
The suitability of the territory of 
Ukraine
for 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
and its natural parasitoid 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. typhlocybae
</tp:taxon-name>
under current and future climatic conditions was determined. The most favourable areas for both species are located in the south, east and centre of the country and in the Zakarpattia Region. There are prospects for the introduction of 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. typhlocybae
</tp:taxon-name>
for classical biocontrol, especially in the southern regions of 
Ukraine
.
</p>
         <p>The main bioclimatic factors influencing the distribution of the species are: bio 10 (Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter), bio 17 (Precipitation of Driest Quarter), bio 6 (Min Temperature of Coldest Month), bio 15 (Precipitation Seasonality).</p>
         <p>
Other factors such as spread by transport and plant material, availability of host plants and woody plants for overwintering of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
may influence the distribution of the species.
</p>
         <p>
It is necessary to develop an effective 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
population control system to prevent further spread and reduce the damage caused by the pest. One of the most effective risk management measures may be to include 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
in the list of regulated non-quarantined pests in 
Ukraine
. It is recommended to monitor plantations on the territory of 
Ukraine
for the presence of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pruinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
, as well as to increase public awareness of these pests and the prospects of their biocontrol.
