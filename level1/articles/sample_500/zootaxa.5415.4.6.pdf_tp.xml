Abstract
</title>
         <p>
The ant genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
</tp:taxon-name>
is a hyper diverse pantropical group of specialised predatory leaf litter dwelling ants. Species richness peaks within tropics, with few species extending into the West Palaearctic realm. A significant proportion of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
species
</tp:taxon-name>
known from the West Palaearctic are non-native, spread via human commerce, and predominately establishing populations within artificially heated greenhouses. In Britain, two 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
species
</tp:taxon-name>
were previously known, 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. rogeri
Emery, 1890
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. perplexa
(
Smith, 1876
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. Here we add a third species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. emmae
(
Emery, 1890
)
</tp:taxon-name>
based upon specimens from the humid tropical biomes at the Eden Project, 
Cornwall
(
UK
). A single record outlined here is noted as the earliest known record of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. emmae
</tp:taxon-name>
from Europe thus far, pre-dating previous records by four years. We provide high resolution images, measurements, and discussion on the ecology of the species. In addition, an updated key to the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
</tp:taxon-name>
of the Europe is supplied.

Introduction
</title>
         <p>
The hyper diverse ant genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
(Myrmicinae)
</tp:taxon-name>
currently comprises over 850 species worldwide (

; 

). Colonies are predominately leaf-litter dwelling, and often difficult to find due to their slow movement and diminutive size. Species feed upon soft bodied leaf litter arthropods in which they ambush and capture using various mandibular ensnaring methods, from simple gripping mandibles to high-power, latchmediated snapping jaws (

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
species
</tp:taxon-name>
richness peaks within the tropical regions with, significantly fewer species known from the West Palaearctic (

; 

; 

; 

; 

). Of the species that are known from the West Palaearctic, a significant number are non-native, being now distributed across the world by human-mediated transportation (

; 

). This spread is not exclusive to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
</tp:taxon-name>
, with many other ant species from different genera known to be adventive, including over 500 species to date, but with hypogaeic and cryptobiotic (i.e. challenging to collect and sample without specialised techniques) species remaining largely undetected (

). Ant introductions have varying ecological consequences from benign, mostly non-destructive introductions (such as many species within greenhouses) to more significant, highly detrimental, biological invasions (

). Some 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
species
</tp:taxon-name>
have characteristics that favour successful introductions such as polygynous colonies and parthenogenic reproduction. A recent assessment by Booher 
et al
., (2023) found 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. eggersi
Emery, 1890
</tp:taxon-name>
became very common post-introduction, likely at the detriment of native 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
species.
</tp:taxon-name>
Few, if any other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
species
</tp:taxon-name>
have been evaluated for their impact on native communities post-invasion however.
</p>
         <p>
One such adventive 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
species
</tp:taxon-name>
is 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. emmae
</tp:taxon-name>
, which is one of the most well redistributed 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, with a near pantropical distribution (

). In the Britain, currently only two 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
species
</tp:taxon-name>
are recorded, 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. rogeri
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. perplexa
</tp:taxon-name>
, with only the latter recorded outdoors (
Guernsey
, Channel Islands) (

; 

; 

, 

). Here we add a third species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. emmae
</tp:taxon-name>
to Britain on the basis of specimens collected from the indoor humid tropical biomes at the Eden Project, 
Cornwall
(
UK
)—a set of climatically controlled greenhouses which accommodate numerous tropical plants from across the globe. Measurements, high resolution images and a brief discussion concerning the species ecology is provided. In addition, the dichotomous key to the known 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
species
</tp:taxon-name>
from Europe is updated, with 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. emmae
</tp:taxon-name>
now included.

Site Information and Collection Methods
</p>
         <p>
The Rainforest Biome at the Eden Project (
figure 1
) mimics rainforest conditions by maintaining humidity around a mean of 90 % and temperature at a mean of 24 °C (range 18 to 35 °C). The biome is the largest indoor rainforest in the world with a maximum height of 
55 m
and length of 
240 m
which include a range of paths, pools, streams, waterfalls and tree top walkways all with an engaging variety of themed exhibits. It contains over 1,000 species of plant which are divided into zones: Tropical Islands, South 
East Asia
, West Africa, Tropical South America and Crops. The care of the plants and replanting of smaller species is very active, constant and includes regular substrate renewal. Whilst excellent for plants this dynamic system of management has proved challenging for entomologists attempting to relocate species that have moved to different zones, declined to a very low density or seemingly undetectable for multiple years only to reappear in good numbers. All successful sampling was carried out at the edge of the biome dominated by bamboo, ferns and grasses. The substrate was a mix of gravel, decomposing plant material and dark organic soil. The habitat can be seen in 
figure 2
with the interception trap in action, the pitfall trap had been set in the same location but is hidden. This particular area is without public access and is not actively cultivated. Specimens were collected by two methods – a cheese baited pitfall trap and in a flight interception trap (FIT) both placed in the West Africa zone (
figure 2
). The traps were set close together in the upper extremities of the biome next to the external boundary where they were left in place for extended periods of more than a year. Their purpose was to sample long term coleopteran diversity. The unlidded pitfall trap comprised of a 300 ml wide mouthed jar set in the ground with 100 ml of 50% propan-1,2-diol and finished off with a generous shake of extra hot chilli powder to deter mammals. The cheese bait comprised of a fermented soft cheese mix (developed and cultured by CRT for its long lasting strong aroma of organic decomposition) which stood inside the pitfall in a 30 ml universal tube with numerous 
0.4 mm
holes melted through the lid to allow the smell to dissipate. The FIT comprised of 4 inverted two litre clear plastic bottles attached upside down to a central pole forming an almost continuous trapping perimeter, each bottle had a large window cut in it to allow flying insects in whereupon touching the sides they dropped into the preservative below. The preservative was 50% propan-1,2-diol with extra hot chilli powder added to deter mammals. The FIT was hung from the supporting arms of the biome dome to hang freely just above the ground. Both trap 
types
are an effective way to sample mobile insect faunas and used in this way at low density can provide useful long term monitoring data on species colonisations as exemplified by the current discovery.

Results
</title>
         <p>
A total of 
two specimens
were collected (
figure 3 A–F
), comprising 
one worker
(

) and 
one queen
(
figure 3 D–F
) from the 
West Africa
zone in the upper biome where the wall meets the ground (
figure 1
, 
figure 2
). 
This area
is without public access and is not actively cultivated. 
Specimens
were identified by comparing morphological characters to the description provided by 

, satisfying all diagnostic characters, as well as queen and worker images on AntWeb.org.

species
</tp:taxon-name>
known from Britain, following 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. rogeri

(

; 

; 

), and 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. perplexa
(

Hamer 
et al
., 2021

)
</tp:taxon-name>
. The record outlined within this paper represents the third mention for 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. emmae
</tp:taxon-name>
in Europe, after being collected in 
The Netherlands
and 
Poland
(

; 

). Records from Mainland Europe are all located within artificially heated greenhouses and therefore correspond well with the record outlined here. Although both studies pre-date this publication, one record provided here (ANTWEB1010138), from 2014, pre-dates the records given in 

and 

, both being from 2018. While time between introductions and first detection for exotic species can span years, making it difficult to determine which of these introductions occurred first, the 
UK
record presented here represents the earliest established population recorded from Europe so far. Additionally, as both records from the same locality were separated by 8 years and with the latest from a reproductive gyne, this suggests that the population is well-established and already reproducing. Sampling methodology and efforts within artificially heated greenhouses across Europe are not equal, and sampling in some nations may not take place at all. Considering the global distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. emmae
(
Wetterer 2012
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, and the long history of the horticultural trade networks (c. three centuries), it therefore seems reasonable to assume that populations may have existed across Europe before this and other publications. The lack of previous records could be as a result of the species cryptobiotic nature and the lack of sampling effort towards greenhouses and other climatically buffered infrastructure (as addressed above, see 

).
</p>
         <p>
Thought to be of Australasian origin(

; 

), 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. emmae
</tp:taxon-name>
has achieved a pantropical distribution via human commerce (

). Outside of artificially heated infrastructure, specimens are often from within disturbed, mesic and xeric habitats, including forests, urban and agricultural areas, and nearly always within leaf litter. Colonies are small, with 

finding several colonies in acorns with fewer than 
50 workers
. Although information is scant regarding the feeding preferences of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. emmae
, 
Deyrup &amp; Deyrup (1999)
</tp:taxon-name>
found observed larvae feeding upon entomobryid Collembola. Moreover, 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. emmae
</tp:taxon-name>
is capable of parthenogenetic reproduction (though 

collected a putative male in Florida from a flight interception trap), as are many tramp 
<tp:taxon-name>
Strumigenys
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, which likely contributes to their adventive success (

). Considering the species climatic requirement, it is unlikely to establish outdoors in Britain, and could in fact be acting as an important leaf litter predator within the humid tropical biomes at the Eden Project. However, the horticultural trade between greenhouses may enable the spread of this species across the region.
