Abstract
</title>
         <p>
Ants are important components of many terrestrial ecosystems because of their high abundance, their central position in food webs, and because they can strongly influence ecosystem properties such as soil aeration, nutrient cycling, and plant community composition. Moreover, ants are also known to respond strongly to changes in environmental and biological conditions. In particular, two major anthropogenic environmental impacts – climate change and the loss of primary producers – may have interactive effects on ant communities. To examine this potential interaction, we quantified pitfall trap sampled ant diversity and activity across a fully factorial experiment manipulating temperature and grassland plant species richness at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in 
Minnesota
, 
USA
. Consistent with previous arthropod studies, we found a significant increase in sampled ant diversity in plots with higher sown plant species richness, such that plots with the largest number of plant species also had the highest sampled ant diversity. However, the strength of this relationship declined significantly in experimentally warmed subplots, especially when considered for higher aggregated spatial scales of samples. Taken together, these results suggest that the positive effects of plant diversity on sampled ant diversity may be partially undermined under warmer conditions.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Because ants are dominant ecological components of many terrestrial systems, understanding how environmental changes influence ant communities is important for predicting effects on ecosystems at large (

). Ants strongly influence arthropod community structure through predation and competition (

), and are adept ecosystem engineers (

). Consequently, they contribute to a wide range of ecosystem functions and services (Del Toro et al. 2012), and, for example, can significantly alter how nutrients cycle in ecosystems (

), the structure and aeration of soils (

), and the kinds of plant species that can colonize a given region (

).
</p>
         <p>
Environmental changes also influence ant communities. Like all organisms, ant fitness and performance vary as a function of temperature, and conditions that are too cold or too hot can lead to steep declines in activity and survival (

). Especially well-studied among ants are the concepts of critical thermal maxima and minima, which, respectively, describe temperatures above or below which individuals become incapacitated and eventually die (

, 

). Although decreases in foraging and nest survival often occur well before critical thermal limits are reached, these metrics are popular because they can be measured consistently in laboratory settings, and can be reasonably good indicators of overall temperature tolerance (

). Importantly, critical thermal limits vary greatly among ant species – for example, even within a single region, critical thermal maxima can differ by almost 10°C (

). These interspecific differences in temperature tolerance are thought to be primary determinants of ant community composition (

, 

), leading to partitioning of geographic regions and microenvironments based on thermal constraints (

). Indeed, a long-term study of 85 ant species in Central Europe found that along with soil moisture, thermal maximum was the most influential factor in determining niche segregation among species (

).
</p>
         <p>
There is currently mixed evidence regarding how ant communities are likely to respond to temperature increases caused by climate change. It has been suggested that ant diversity may increase as a result of warming in cooler sites, whereas in warmer sites, warming could lead to ant diversity declines (

). Along natural temperature gradients, ant diversity has generally been found to increase as a function of mean annual temperature (

, 

). One potential explanation for this trend would be that more ant species are limited by lower thermal tolerances than by upper tolerances, although the overall pattern is also confounded with elevation and latitudinal diversity gradients. For example, in a study of over 130 North American ant species, 

found that the temperature ranges that species inhabited were significantly related to their critical thermal minima, but not their maxima. Nevertheless, there is also evidence that extreme warming, or temperature increases in already warm sites, can have significant detrimental effects on many ant species and on ant diversity. For example, when measured across large temperature gradients, a ‘humpshaped’ relationship can emerge, with ant diversity initially increasing with temperature, but then declining at higher temperatures (

). Similarly, in a survey tracking changes in ant communities across North America over 20 years, 

found that small temperature increases (&lt;+1°C) were associated with slightly higher overall nest abundance, but nest abundance declined steeply in regions with larger temperature increases. These results also accord with those from a warming experiment replicated across two forested sites in the eastern 
United States
, where heating treatments had no detectable effect on ant community diversity in the cooler northern site, whereas it led to a small but significant decline in ant diversity at the warmer southern site (

). Furthermore, in both sites, warming led to decreases in overall stability of ant community (

).
</p>
         <p>
To better understand these context dependent effects of warming on ant communities, in this paper we test how ant diversity and activity respond to experimental warming along a gradient of increasing plant species richness. Our study is embedded within an existing long-term experiment testing the effects of warming on grassland plant communities (the Biodiversity and Climate experiment, or ‘BAC’, experiment number 249) at the Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research site near Bethel, MN, 
USA
. In particular, BAC includes a fully factorial combination of experimental warming treatments and an experimental plant diversity gradient.
</p>
         <p>
We focus on the interactive effects of experimental warming and plant diversity manipulations for two reasons. First, the impacts of climate change extend well beyond direct effects of warming, and include effects on the diversity, composition, and productivity of primary producers (

). Accounting for these indirect effects is important, since both plant diversity and plant biomass directly impact insect communities (

, 

, 

, 

), in particular by enhancing the structural and functional diversity of resources, thereby supporting a higher abundance and diversity of insects (

, 

). Proxies of primary productivity have also been shown to be positively related to ant diversity (

), and previous studies at Cedar Creek have identified positive effects of plant diversity on aboveground plant biomass production (

) (
Fig. 1B
), and positive effects of plant biomass on insect abundance and diversity (

).
</p>
         <p>
Second, plant biodiversity – including plant species richness and community structure – modulates abiotic and biotic conditions, including temperature (e.g. 

), and therefore has the potential to alter the effects of warming on ant communities. In particular, increased aboveground biomass, which is positively correlated with plant biodiversity in most grassland experiments (

), shades the soil surface and increases evapotranspiration, which both lower the temperature (

, 

) (
Fig. 1A,C–D
), and increase relative humidity under the canopy (

) (
Fig. 1B
). Previously published results from BAC also show that increases in sown plant diversity caused significant reductions in temperatures both above and belowground, and that heating treatments caused significantly less warming in plots sown with more plant species (S1A–B in 

; 
Fig. 1
and 

Figs S 
1–3 in

this paper). While these results from experimental systems may not necessarily reflect the full range of conditions observed across natural environments, positive relationships between plant biodiversity and standing biomass – and thus presumably also buffering effects on temperature and humidity – have been observed across a very wide range of natural grasslands (

). Because ant communities are known to be sensitive to changes in soil temperature and moisture (

), it therefore seems possible that these interactive effects of climate change, and buffering effects of vegetation, could be influential on sampled ant diversity across many different natural systems.
</p>
         <p>Jointly, these aspects of ant and grassland plant ecology in temperate regions lead us to several hypotheses and predictions. First, in the absence of experimental heating, we expect to find a positive effect of sown plant species richness on pitfall trap sampled ant diversity, consistent with previous experimental results. Second, we propose two alternate hypotheses relating to direct effects of experimental heating on ants: if more ant species are constrained by their upper thermal limits at our site, then we expect to sample higher ant diversity in control subplots than in heated subplots; alternatively, if more ant species are constrained by lower thermal limits, then we expect to sample higher ant diversity in heated subplots. Finally, given that higher plant diversity and biomass reduce soil and surface temperatures in our system, we predict that effects of heat stress on ants will be reduced in plots sown with higher plant diversity, whereas any effects of cold stress will be magnified.</p>

2.1 Experimental design
</title>
         <p>
We used pitfall traps to sample ant communities in August and September over two years (2011 and 2012) within the BAC experiment at Cedar Creek. BAC was initiated in 2009, when a warming component was added to an existing plant biodiversity experiment (‘Big Bio’, experiment number 120). The 
9 m
× 
9 m
plots were seeded with 1, 4, or 16 perennial grassland species in 1994 and hand-weeded to maintain species composition (

). A subset of 32 plots was chosen for experimental warming treatments, including 14 1-species, 9 4-species, and 9 16-species plots. Within each plot in BAC, 1200-watt electric infrared heating lamps were installed over 
2.5 m
× 
3 m
subplots, raising soil temperature by approximately 3°C at a dept of 
1 cm
below the soil surface (n.b. BAC includes both ‘high’ and ‘low’ heating treatments – only ‘high’ treatments were measured for this study). Heated vs. control subplots were assigned randomly within each plot, and the plots are distributed haphazardly across the full extent of the ca. 7 ha Big Bio experiment to avoid spatial confounding factors. Heaters are run continuously (i.e. 24 hours/day) every year from March to November.
</p>
         <p>

Mean soil temperature was measured in each subplot using Thermochron iButton loggers – we report results for measurements taken at 
1 cm
below the soil surface, as these were the depths that were most consistently measured over time. The loggers measured hourly mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and were placed in the center of the plot, within approximately 

20 
cm of the pitfall trap

locations where ants were sampled (see Ant sampling, below). Relative humidity was measured using Hygrochron iButton loggers, located 
10 cm
above the soil surface. These loggers were attached to the top of wooden stakes, and placed under a white plastic roof to shelter them from direct sunlight and rainfall. Average daily soil temperatures in the plots 
1 cm
below the soil surface varied from ca. 25–35°C in August, and ca. 10–25°C in September. However, maximum daily temperatures regularly exceeded 40°C, and often exceeded 50°C, especially in 2012, which was a particularly hot and dry year in central 
Minnesota
(
Fig. S
2–3). In general, heating led to larger and more significant increases in nighttime temperatures than daytime temperatures (
Fig. S1
), and more significant increases in minimum temperatures than maximum temperatures (
Fig. S
2–3)

.
</p>
         <p>
Previous studies in BAC have shown that plots sown with higher plant species richness have significantly lower temperatures. In particular, average summer temperatures 
1 cm
below the soil surface are roughly 2°C lower in plots sown with 16 species than in monocultures, and temperature increases caused by the heating treatments are about 50 % smaller in the more diverse plots (
Fig. S1b
in 

). More detailed information on the experimental design and plant community responses are available in 

and 

. Temperature measurement data are available through 

, and plant aboveground biomass data are available through 

.

For
reference, some details about the experimental site are summarized below: 
Cedar Creek
is located in central 
Minnesota
(
45.40°N
, 
93.20°W
; ca. 

275 m
above sea level

), near the ecotone between the eastern deciduous forest and midwestern tallgrass prairie regions. Mean annual precipitation is around 
77 cm
, of which roughly 60 % falls 
between April and August. The
site is characterized by sandy, well-draining soils, with relatively low nitrogen and organic content. Average summer high temperatures are around 27°C, with average winter daily low temperatures around –14°C; however, temperature extremes in the region are very large, and regularly exceed ±40°C (

). Plant communities in BAC are dominated by herbaceous grassland plant species, with average vegetation field heights ranging from ~ 

0.5 m

to 

1.5 m

depending on species composition (heights are typically greater in plots that include the tallgrass prairie species

Andropogon gerardii
</tp:taxon-name>
and

) (

). In accordance with historical fire regimes, plots are burned annually, which prevents the buildup of leaf litter over time

2.2 Ant sampling
</title>
         <p>
In 
August and September 2011
and 2012, we sampled ant diversity in all heated and control subplots in BAC. We utilized pairs of pitfall traps 
5.1 cm
in diameter, installed 
10 cm
apart in the center of each subplot. Each trap was held in a PVC ‘sleeve’ permanently installed in the ground, and filled with approximately 25 ml of a mixture of 300:2:1 tap water to dish soap to table salt by volume. We left traps open for 48-hours during each sampling event, collecting them on August 6 and September 
11 in
2011, and August 19 and September 
23 in
2012. None of the 48-hour periods included significant precipitation, and all sampling occurred before the first frost of the year. For all results discussed below, samples were pooled across years by subplot prior to analyses, resulting in a total of 128 sampling events (i.e. 32 plots, two subplots per plot, two measurements per year). We pooled data in this manner because preliminary analyses revealed that sample sizes were too small to detect within-subplot differences in ant communities. All specimens were identified to species using taxonomic keys (

, 

, 

) and museum collections at Cedar Creek and the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. All data are available through 

. Note that because destructive sampling was not permitted in BAC because it would interfere with other ongoing experiments, we were not able to quantify ant nest abundance, as this would have required digging up plots to sift through surface soil and litter. Nevertheless, since all plots in our study included spatially proximal warmed and non-warmed treatments, this contrast provides strong statistical evidence for changes in sampled ant diversity as a function of warming treatment (though see the Caveats section in the discussion for some notes on potential confounding effects of this spatial proximity, especially related to foraging behavior and movement of ants between subplots).

2.3 Statistical analyses
</title>
         <p>
All data manipulation and analyses were conducted in R, version 4.0.2 (R. 

). Full source code and data for all analyses are available in the supplement via www.soil-organisms.org, and online at github.com/adamtclark/BAC_ant_analysis. Following ‘best practices’ for analyzing ant diversity, we conduct our analyses on ‘incidence’ data (

). Incidence – also called ‘species density’, e.g. sensu 

– summarizes the number of times that a species is present in a sampling event, and is generally considered preferable to metrics based on numbers of individual ants sampled, as individual counts can be confounded with nest size and location (

, 

, 

). To account for differences in the relative incidence of species, and to prevent rare species from disproportionately impacting our results, we report ant diversity in terms of exponentiated Shannon diversity (however, results for richness were similar; see Fig. S5) (

).
</p>
         <p>
Although our experimental design is balanced with respect to heating treatments, the number of plots within each sown plant richness treatment varied. We therefore use rarefied estimates of ant diversity for all subsequent analyses. Rarefaction controls for differences in sample sizes to generate incidence data for our subsequent analyses (which would otherwise bias diversity metrics) by re-sampling data to estimate the expected diversity in each sampling group given constant sampling effort (

, 

). Rarefaction also shows how diversity varies across different scales of organization – i.e. for sample-level (‘alpha’) vs. treatment-level (‘gamma’) diversity (

, 

). To rarefy our diversity estimates, we randomly sampled plots (without replacement) to generate samples ranging from a single plot, up to the maximum number of plots within each sown plant richness class (i.e. 14 monocultures vs. 9 4- and 16-species plots). We repeated the procedure 10,000 times (i.e. simple, uniform bootstrapping without replacement) to produce a distribution of ant diversity estimates for each level of sampling intensity.
</p>
         <p>For sampling intensity level, we then tested for effects of treatments on ant diversity using ordinary least squares linear regression. Each regression was fitted to rarefied exponentiated Shannon ant diversity, as a fully interactive function of sub-plot warming treatment (a binary variable, indicating heated or not heated), sampling month (a categorical variable, indicating either August or September), and plot-level sown plant species richness (a continuous variable), i.e. of the form ‘ant diversity~heating*month*plant richness’ in R’s ‘lm’ notation. For easier interpretation of the resulting regression, we standardized sown plant richness by dividing raw values by the mean plant richness sown across all treatments, such that the ‘y-intercept’ of the regression corresponded to conditions at intermediate plant diversity levels (a hypothetical plot seeded with 7 plant species). Visual inspection of residual plots and normal quantile-quantile plots revealed no deviations from the standard assumptions required for OLS.</p>
         <p>To test for differences in pitfall trap sampled ant diversity, we used multiple least squares regression, using the lm function in R. To control for pseudoreplication and to generate meaningful confidence intervals for analyses, we fit a separate regression for each of the 10,000 bootstrapped iterations from the rarefaction analyses. Because each aggregated observation was independent and balanced across plots and treatments, additional statistical controls, e.g. via a mixed effects model, were not necessary. We then used the resulting distribution of regression coefficients to quantify uncertainty in parameter estimates. In sum, this process resulted in a series of estimates of the effects of heating, sown plant richness, and sampling month on ant diversity, with separate estimates for each level of sampling intensity ranging from one plot up to a maximum of 9 plots (n.b. we did not conduct regressions for sampling intensities of&gt;9 plots, as this would have required us to exclude data from the 4- and 16-species plots).</p>
         <p>
Finally, to test for differences in sampled ant activity across treatments, we fit linear mixed effects models using the lmer function in R, with a random intercept varying by plot, nested within year (

, R. 

). Ant activity refers to the total number of individuals collected in pitfall traps, summed across all species. Note that unlike activity estimated at the level of individual species, which as discussed above can be biased for a number of reasons (

), summed activity observed across all species can be a useful indicator of differences in overall abundance and foraging rate (

). However, ant activity is not necessarily indicative of the frequency or size of ant nests, as activity can be influenced by many factors, including the proximity of nests to traps, and ant foraging behavior.

3. Results
</title>
         <p>
We collected roughly 18,000 ants, including three subfamilies (Formicinae, Myrmicinae, and Ponerinae), nine genera, and 15 species or species groups (Table 1). Most species were in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Formica
</tp:taxon-name>
, whereas most individuals were either 
<tp:taxon-name>
Monomorium emarginatum
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
Solenopsis molesta
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
Raw rarefaction results showed substantial differences among treatments in terms of sample-standardized pitfall trap sampled ant diversity (Fig. 2). At the scale of a single plot (i.e. treatment-level ‘alpha’ ant diversity), mean Shannon diversity from pitfall trap samples ranged from five to seven species equivalents (i.e. exponentiated Shannon diversity, 

eH

) in August, and about four to five in September. At the scale of the largest total number of samples in each plant diversity-by-heating treatment class (i.e. treatment-level ‘gamma’ ant diversity), mean exponentiated Shannon diversity of ants collected in the pitfall traps ranged from roughly seven to nine species equivalents regardless of sampling month. Importantly, results from monoculture plots suggest that ant diversity saturates around a sampling intensity of nine plots, suggesting that sample sizes available for plots sown with higher plant richness were sufficiently large to characterize the resident ant community.
</p>
         <p>Regressions revealed no significant differences in overall mean sampled ant diversity (i.e. regression intercept), regardless of sampling intensity or heating treatment (Fig. 3A,B), suggesting that warming had no detectable effect on pitfall trap samples in plots sown with intermediate levels of plant species richness. However, positive effects of sown plant species richness on sampled ant diversity were detected for both control and heated subplots (Fig. 3C,D; slope is significantly positive at p &lt;0.05 for scales of 4 or more samples from control subplots in August, 6 or more samples for control subplots in September, and for 8 or more samples in heated subplots for both August and September). Moreover, the positive effect of plant richness on sampled ant diversity was significantly weaker in heated subplots, especially in the summer months and for larger numbers of samples (at treatment-level ‘gamma’ scale of 9 plots, p &lt;0.004 for August; p &lt;0.057 for September).</p>
         <p>
For ant activity, there was high variability across treatments and months, with a significant decline in activity in the fall relative to the summer (
Fig. 4
). Activity was somewhat higher in heated than in control subplots, although the differences were generally small and rarely significant.

4. Discussion
</title>
         <p>Our results demonstrate interactive negative effects of plant diversity loss and warming on pitfall trap sampled ant diversity in our experimental grassland system. These differences were clearest in summer months and at the highest level of aggregation of samples within each treatment (i.e. treatment-level ‘gamma’ diversity, based on samples of 9 plots), for which we detected a loss of about 0.05 species equivalence units per plant species in heated vs. control subplots (Fig. 3C). In the context of our dataset, this effect would indicate that heating causes the loss of roughly one common ant species (or several rare ant species) from pitfall trap samples in monocultures relative to plots sown with 16 plant species. Effects were weaker and less significant in the fall months, when temperatures were generally cooler, as well as for lower levels of sample aggregation, such that the smallest and least statistically clear differences occurred at the scale of individual subplots.</p>
         <p>

This pattern is consistent with the loss of rare ant species in the warmest plots (i.e. heated monocultures). The positive effect of sown plant richness on sampled ant diversity that we measured in heated subplots was both less significant for plot-level ‘alpha’ diversity than for treatment-level ‘gamma’ diversity, and the overall effect size was smaller. This smaller overall effect would suggest that common ant species, which are disproportionately represented at the plot-level, were less strongly impacted by warming than rarer ant species (either in terms of their presence, or in terms of their foraging behavior). Our sample size is too small to statistically test for effects on individual ant species, but this explanation accords with results for two rare ant species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Camponotus noveboracensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ponera pennsylvanica
</tp:taxon-name>
, which were entirely absent from heated subplots (Table 1). Previous results from 
Harvard Forest
, 
Massachusetts
(

), and 
Duke Forest
, 
North Carolina
(

), indicate critical thermal limits of around 40°C for these species (both slightly below the average critical thermal limits for ant species reported at those sites). Although thermal tolerances cannot be reliably extrapolated across sites, maximum temperatures at our site did exceed this threshold more frequently in heated subplots than in control subplots (
Fig. S
2), potentially indicating that these two species were excluded from samples due to heat stress

.
</p>
         <p>
A problem with this explanation is that at the ‘gamma’ level, overall sampled ant diversity was actually higher in heated monocultures than in control monocultures (for both exponentiated Shannon and richness; see 
Fig. S4A–B
, and Fig. S6). There are at least two possible explanations for why heated monocultures would have higher sampled ant diversity than controls. First, heating might have benefited ant species that are near their thermal 
<tp:taxon-name>
minimum (
Bujan et al. 2020
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. However, this explanation is not consistent with the strong increase in sampled ant diversity that we observed in plots sown with high plant species richness, as these were also by far the coolest plots in the experiment (
Fig. 1B–C, S1–S
3). An alternative explanation is that warming led to higher overall ant activity, and thus higher detection of more species in pitfall trap samples (

, 

), in heated monocultures. This explanation is consistent with results from our activity analyses, which showed higher average ant activity in heated vs. control subplots, although differences were only significant in September (
Fig. 4
).
</p>
         <p>
One remaining complication is that while increased ant activity might be responsible for higher sampled ant diversity in heated monocultures, it does not explain why differences disappear at higher sown plant richness levels. Differences in ant activity between control and heated subplots did not change significantly with plant diversity, and if anything, activity differences were slightly larger in plots sown with high plant richness (
Fig. 4
). If our results were driven primarily by differences in ant activity (i.e. the number of individuals sampled), we therefore would expect to find even higher sampled ant diversity in these heated subplots relative to controls (

); however, this was not the case (
Fig. S4
).
</p>
         <p>
As a purely phenomenological explanation, it appears that the pattern we observe is driven by negative effects of heating on the otherwise strong positive effect of sown plant richness on sampled ant diversity. Specifically, while pitfall trap samples from control subplots gain roughly 2 exponentiated Shannon ant species equivalents in plots sown with 16 plant species relative to monocultures, samples in heated subplots gain only one ant species equivalent (Fig. 3). Were this pattern to hold at higher levels of plant diversity, we would expect these declines to intensify. Indeed, in an additional subset of plots in BAC sown with 32 plant species, which were meant to more closely mimic the diversity of local natural grasslands, we applied the same ant sampling methods as described above, and found a net loss of 2 ant species in heated subplot pitfall trap samples relative to controls (again including 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. pennsylvanica
</tp:taxon-name>
). While we did not formally analyze these results because BAC included only 6 32-species plots, and because these plots were not weeded, which makes them difficult to compare to the rest of the experiment, it is worth noting that this difference in sampled ant diversity almost exactly matches our extrapolated expectation of one ant species equivalent lost per 16 sown plant species in heated plots vs. controls.
</p>
         <p>
A possible mechanistic explanation for our results is that they are driven by a mixture of processes. First, in monocultures, sampled ant diversity was relatively low, and increased activity caused by heating treatments could have led to increased observed incidence of some ant species simply because more ant individuals crossed through the sampled area per unit time (

). Second, overall ant diversity increased with sown plant species richness, potentially due to increased primary productivity, higher habitat complexity, or a higher abundance and diversity of food items (

, 

). Third, a subset of ant species were excluded from samples in heated subplots, potentially because temperatures either directly exceeded their critical thermal limits, or due to chronic exposure to less acute heat stress (

). Finally, in plots sown with higher plant richness, overall temperatures were lower, and effects of heating on soil temperatures were less acute (

), thus leading to a reduced negative effect of heating sampled ant diversity in plots with higher plant diversity.
</p>
         <p>
This combination of processes is also consistent with results from several other studies of warming effects on ants. For example, Kaspari et al.’s 20-year observational study of North American ants likewise suggests that while moderate warming can lead to increases in observed ant diversity, more intense warming is associated with ant diversity declines (

). Interestingly, Kaspari et al. found similar results for both species incidence and overall colony abundance, suggesting that increased ant diversity associated with moderate warming is not solely driven by changes in activity. Similarly, in their studies of warming effects in northern vs. southern North American sites, 

reported relatively modest declines in ant diversity with warming, and only at their warmer southern site. Interestingly, a common feature across all of these experiments, including ours, is that observed changes in ant diversity were relatively small compared to those observed across larger geographically driven temperature gradients (

, 

). This limited effect of warming on ants in experimental systems is potentially indicative of the limited spatial extent of experimental heating treatments, which can only encompass a few square meters, thereby allowing ants to enter and leave the warmed region in response to temperature stress. Our results are therefore likely conservative estimates of the effects expected from warming at larger spatial and temporal scales.
</p>
         <p>
Because warming treatments similar to the one used in BAC have reported long-term temperature increases of 1–2°C as deep as a meter below the soil surface (

), it is likely that our warming treatments influenced both surface foraging and nest abundance, reducing species ability to adapt through behavioral change (e.g. by moving nests or foraging activity to deeper in the soil). Many ants relocate their nests frequently (

), and any process that changes the rate and relative probability with which ant species replace one another at sites can eventually lead to local exclusion of some species (

, 

). It is therefore possible that over time, the effects that we document here may intensify even at the limited spatial scale of our experimental plots. Similarly, there are almost certainly rare ant species that we failed to detect in our study. Other studies have attempted to address detection errors by applying diversity indices or extrapolating out rarefaction curves, which can provide a rough indication for the number of unobserved species in a sampled region (

). Again, these methods would be highly inaccurate given our small sample sizes, which is why we do not apply them here (

). Nevertheless, given that the loss of rare species appears to drive the negative effects of heating on ant diversity that we observe at high levels of sown plant species richness, better accounting for these rare ant species would likely reveal even stronger heating effects than we report here.

4.1 Caveats
</title>
         <p>It is tempting to directly extrapolate our results for pitfall trap sampled ant diversity as an estimate of overall changes in ‘true’ ant diversity at our site (e.g. including the size, density, and presence or absence of nests). However, we stress that this kind of comparison is difficult. In particular, because heated subplots in our study were relatively small, and always immediately proximate to non-heated regions, it is possible that sampled ant diversity in our heated pitfall trap samples simply indicates a change in foraging behavior – e.g. due to ants avoiding the heated plots when temperatures exceeded their thermal maxima, and/or entering the plots when temperatures dropped below thermal minima. Thus, depending on the ant species and the local temperature, these spatial effects could have led to either increases or decreases in sampled ant diversity relative to the actual diversity of ant species at our site. Nevertheless, given that our results accord with those from other larger-scale experiments, and from natural systems, there is at least some reason to believe that our findings could be indicative of future trends, e.g. when larger-scale warming due to climate change will reduce possibilities to avoid heat stress by changing foraging locations or behaviors.</p>

4.2 Conclusions
</title>
         <p>Our results show that experimental warming decreases the positive effects of plant species richness on pitfall trap sampled ant diversity. Our results therefore suggest that although warming and loss of plant diversity both impact ants, positive effects of plant richness on ant diversity may be partially undermined under warmer conditions. These results therefore have implications both for basic understanding of ant biology and community ecology, and for potential efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change on local ant communities.</p>
