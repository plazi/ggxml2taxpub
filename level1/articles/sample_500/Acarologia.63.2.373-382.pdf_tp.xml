I am grateful to you for informing about the passing away of Prof. Mohamed A. Zaher. It is certainly very sad news, and acarology loses much with his death. But we should be thankful to God for allowing us to share part of our lifetime with this great acarologist, absorbing part of his great knowledge about mites in general, especially the Egyptian mites. He was a good friend of many other well-known acarologists, leading to the conduction of beautiful scientific works. Despite the many papers he published, I would like to highlight his “Predaceous and nonphytophagous mites in 
Egypt
”, published in 1986, bringing together what was known by that time about the taxonomy of the Egyptian plant and soil mites. That was certainly a major contribution to those interested in knowing about the identity of mites of those groups, constructed in close collaboration with renowned American acarologists, well represented by Dr Edward Baker. Dr Zaher was also the mentor of a number of acarologists, who have significantly contributed to mite taxonomy along the years, and who will continue to do so.

I have met Prof. Zaher for the first time during an African Acarology Symposium in 
Egypt
in 2004, which was a huge privilege. However, he made a huge impression on me when I was still a young acarologist. During that time, 
South Africa
was politically in a bad place and ignored by most scientists. Prof. Zaher was one of the few acarologists who knew that it was a political and not acarological issue. He was one of the few who was willing to share his monumental articles with us. His two volumes of “Survey and ecological studies of phytophagous, predacious and soil mites in 
Egypt
” are a forever reminder of his kindness to us and we will always be thankful to him.

M. A. Zaher was a prolific scholar who revolutionized the scientific understanding of the diversity of mites not only in 
Egypt
, but also in many other nearby countries in the region. Throughout, he sought to connect mite systematics, ecology, and other disciplines to mentor the next generation of scientists. He was among the most influential acarologists, using his expertise in taxonomy and ecology of mites to improve mite pest management in agro-ecosystems. He also sought to make biodiversity information more readily accessible. He understood the value of information contained in museum collections and was an early proponent of data basing individual mite specimens and collections as a whole. M. A. Zaher served as a reputable scientific reference for many researchers as well as the curator of the mite reference collection of the Egyptian Society of Acarology Museum (ESAM), Zoology and Agricultural Nematology Department, the Faculty of Agriculture, 
Cairo
University, 
Giza governorate
, 
Egypt
until his death.
</p>
         <p>
M. A. Zaher graduated in 1948 at the Faculty of Agriculture, 
Cairo
University (Fouad
</p>
         <p>
I), one of the oldest and most respected schools in 
Egypt
dedicated to the study of strong interdisciplinary focus, with a large cohort of graduate students and a tranquil leafy campus at 
Giza governorate
, 
Egypt
. Immediately afterward, his academic career was linked to that same institution as an administrator.
</p>
         <p>
He joined the Department of Plant Protection in 1954 and obtained his Master’s degree in the Faculty of Agriculture, 
Cairo
University. Three years later, he received his PhD in Entomology from London University. He became a lecturer in 1958, associate professor in
</p>
         <p>
1964 and full professor in 1971. He was the head of the Department of Zoology and Agricultural Nematology from 1976 to 1982. Upon retiring in 1987, he was awarded the title of professor emeritus of the Faculty of Agriculture, 
Cairo
University.
</p>
         <p>
His main professional interest was the study of the mite fauna of 
Egypt
. His contributions on the subject are tremendous and span from this early stage until his retirement. He was the first to establish the scientific school of acarology in 
Egypt
at the Faculty of Agriculture, in 1959. This large scientific school spreads to universities and research centres in 
Egypt
and other Arab countries. Many of the Egyptian and Arab researchers graduated from this school, having turned leaders and well-known globally. The number of researchers has increased in this field in 
Egypt
, exceeding what was found in many European countries at that time.
</p>
         <p>
The years 1978–1986 solidified M. A. Zaher’s knowledge on acarology as he began a series of visiting professorships and scientific explorations on mites around the world, working on mite bioecology, taxonomy, and biological control. These included a visit in 1978 to the Acarology Laboratories of the 
United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the states of 
Maryland
and 
Florida
, two visits to the Acarology Division of the British Museum, in 1978 and 1982, several visits to Universities and Research Institutions of Plant Protection in the 
United Kingdom
in 1983, and two visits to the Acarology Laboratory, the Faculty of Science, Amsterdam University, 
The Netherlands
in 1980 and 1986.
</p>
         <p>
In 1976, M. A. Zaher started participating in international projects such as: 1) The American- Egyptian project (1976–1982), of which he was the Egyptian coordinator while Dr E.W. Baker the American coordinator. A team of acarologists from different Egyptian institutions was assigned to that purpose. His activities corresponded to the discovery and selection of promising Egyptian natural enemies of pest organisms, for use in 
Egypt
as biological control agents; 2) The Egyptian-German Project (1982–1990), for pest rodents in Egyptian crops and gardens.
</p>
         <p>
During his long and productive career, M. A. Zaher published more than 133 scholarly papers in the field of acarology, most of which in journals of international audience, e.g., Nature, Annals of the Entomological Society of America, International Journal of Acarology, Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, Acarologia, Experimental &amp; Applied Acarology, Insect Science &amp; its Application, Entomophaga, Zeitschrift für Angewandte Entomologie, Archives of Phytopathology. Such publications included environmental, biological and taxonomical studies on plant-feeding and predatory mites on field crops, vegetables, fruits, and ornamental plants. Studying plant-feeding mite species, their dispersal, and food preference led to their successful control in 
Egypt
.
</p>
         <p>Over 63 years serving as a professor, M. A. Zaher acted with leadership in scientific research and technological development, bringing invaluable contributions to acarology. He was the first to study the biology of predatory mites globally, to know their preferred prey and the role they played and how they could be used for the biological control of mite/insect pests and fungi.</p>
         <p>
Such studies helped to enlarge agricultural production by increasing awareness and knowledge of farmers about these economically important organisms. That resulted in improved and sustainable control of the harmful mites with predatory mites in 
Egypt
and elsewhere.
</p>
         <p>M. A. Zaher wrote some scientific books which were widely used by postgraduate students,</p>
         <p>such as 1) Plant-feeding mites; 2) Predatory and parasitic mites; 3) Ecology and biology of mites; 4) Morphology of mites.</p>
         <p>But the impact of the acarological works authored or co-authored by M. A. Zaher went beyond the impact of each of them, as these were integrated into the extensive publication of</p>
         <p>
1986 titled “ 
Survey and Ecological Studies on Phytophagous, Predaceous and Soil Mites in
</p>
         <p>
Egypt

″. That publication had inspiring effect on students, colleagues, and scientists interested in the Egyptian 
<tp:taxon-name>Acari</tp:taxon-name>
, detailing a comprehensive survey for the discovery of plant-feeding and predatory mites on several crops in 
Egypt
. This book was intended to be held next to a microscope, so that the tiny organisms could be studied and identified. It included about
</p>
         <p>400 species with information about their distribution, economic importance, description,</p>
         <p>
illustrations, and taxonomic keys; about 115 of them were new to science or reported for the first time in 
Egypt
. That publication simplified the task of researchers and scholars in the study of these organisms, so important in agricultural production. It was distributed to faculties and research centres in 
Egypt
and in other Arabian countries, as well as to the USDA and other foreign leading universities and research centres. It took six years to complete this book comprising 1000 pages and divided in four parts, with several Egyptian authors making contributions. It resulted from extensive activities conducted within a joint Egypt-USA programme financed by USDA.
</p>
         <p>
Over the course of his career, M. A. Zaher had been an active editorial board member in a number of scientific societies, including the Egyptian Society of Entomology, the Egyptian Society of Zoology, the Egyptian Society of Natural Resources, the Royal Insect Society of London, and the American Society of Acarology. He was elected as a member of the advisory board of the International Journal of Acarology for 20 years, since 1976. An elective member of the International Advisory Council for Biosystematic in Entomology (I.A.C.B.S.E.) as representative for the Middle East in 1980s. He founded the Egyptian Society of Acarology which publishes the Journal of the Egyptian Society of Acarology 
ACARINES
(), serving as president of the Society and editor-in-chief of the journal.
</p>
         <p>
M. A. Zaher was a member of many technical committees, such as the Permanent Scientific Committee for the Promotion of Professors on Plant Protection in 
Egypt
and abroad from the 1970s to the 1990s, the Recommendation Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Academy of Scientific Research and Technology (ASRT).
</p>
         <p>
He attended several national and international scientific meetings such as: the International Congress of Acarology in Fort Colins, 
Colorado
, 
USA
(1963), 
Michigan
, 
USA
(1978), and 
Edinburgh
, 
Scotland
, 
UK
(1982); International Congress of Entomology, 
Hamburg
, 
Germany
(1980); International Congress of Plant Protection, Brighton, 
England
, 
UK
(1983); Third International Congress of African Acarologists, 
Giza
, 
Egypt
(2004); First International Conference of Plant Protection Research Institute, Dokii, 
Egypt
(1980); First and Second Conference of Economic Entomology (Egyptian Society of Entomology) (1989 and 2007).
</p>
         <p>
He described 50 new genera/species of mites since 1960s. By being internationally known, acarologists from the American continent, 
Russia
, 
South Africa
, 
Iran
, and 
India
named several new mite species and genera in his honor for his distinguished effort for the advancement of acarology. Only to cite some examples, E.W. Baker named one new species (
<tp:taxon-name>
Paralorryia zaheri
</tp:taxon-name>
) in1968, H.A. 
Denmark
named one new predatory mite species (
<tp:taxon-name>
Typhlodromus zaheri
</tp:taxon-name>
) in 1992,
</p>
         <p>
V.I. Mirtofanov named a new genus of phytophagous mites 
<tp:taxon-name>
Zaheria
</tp:taxon-name>
() in 1973, recently a new predatory mite (
<tp:taxon-name>
Proctolaelaps zaheri
</tp:taxon-name>
) was named after him in a paper by E.A. Ueckermann and G.J. de Moraes. Several mite species have been named in his honor by Egyptian acarologists.
</p>
         <p>
M. A. Zaher was awarded several national and international prizes, such as the Medal of Science and Arts of the second class in 1989; a certificate of appreciation and gratitude from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Ministry of Agriculture in 1990 for the distinguished effort in the development of agricultural research; a certificate of appreciation in 2000 from the International Journal of Acarology on the occasion of its silver anniversary commemoration, for his contribution for the advancement of acarology in 
Egypt
; the Scientific Creativity Award by the National Bank of 
Egypt
from the ASRT in 2002; a certificate of appreciation from the Faculty Members Club at 
Cairo
University as an ideal professor in
</p>
         <p>
2004, in recognition of his teaching and scientific research activities since appointed as an administrator in 
October 1948
. During the Third International Congress of African Acarologists in 
Egypt
in 
January 2004
, the editorial board of the International Journal of Acarology honored him with a collection of modern acarological books to be deposited in the library of the Faculty of Agriculture, 
Cairo
University, in recognition of his pioneering work in acarology in 
Egypt
. Finally, he received the State Appreciation Award in Agricultural Sciences in 2013 from the ASRT.
</p>
         <p>M. A. Zaher has supervised many MSc and PhD students (more than 65 theses). His graduate students have conducted research on mite biodiversity, taxonomy and integrated management of pest mites. He coordinated, in dissertation and thesis works, the basic and applied research that led to the registration of mite species. Throughout his professional life, he always had a key role in the training and guidance of new professors and researchers. While M. A. Zaher officially retired in 1987, he continued to supervise master and doctoral students,</p>
         <p>
to publish, to examine and evaluate doctoral and master theses, and to promote researchers and faculty members in Arab and foreign countries (i.e., 
Pakistan
, 
Saudi Arabia
, 
Sudan
, and 
Jordan
). Also, he was responsible for training postgraduate students from the University of Amsterdam, 
the Netherlands
at the Acarology Laboratory, the Faculty of Agriculture, Cairo University, as summer courses of 2–3 months for three years in the 1980s, within a scientific protocol between the two universities for the exchange of faculty members and postgraduate students.
</p>
         <p>M. A. Zaher was a patient, helpful, knowledgeable guide, as well as a generous mentor, influencing several learners of acarology. A multitude of students and colleagues have learnt from his truly encyclopedic knowledge and thoughtful advice. Not only his great accuracy, precision and criticism in scientific matters, but also his unbiased openness in discussions, and his humbleness. Those who knew him and worked with him remember him as a passionate scientist and a beloved mentor with a wonderfully generous spirit. The scientific world of acarology loses much with M. A. Zaher’s death.</p>
