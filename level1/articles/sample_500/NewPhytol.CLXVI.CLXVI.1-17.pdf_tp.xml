Despite their ancient origin, modern orchid species diversity mainly originated over the last 5 Ma, with the highest speciation rates in Panama and Costa Rica.

Introduction
</title>
         <p>
The angiosperm tree of life is characterised by the rise and demise of species, leading to species-rich and depauperate lineages coexisting in time and space (

; 

). Investigating factors behind angiosperm diversification requires ancient, species-rich clades thriving across the globe and having a fossil record. One such clade is the 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
. With 29 524 species (

; 

; 

), orchids are among the most species-rich groups of flowering plants, with molecular dating studies having estimated their initial diversification at 112–76 million years ago (Ma) (

; 

; 

; 

; Serna-Sanchez 
et al
., 2021). This diversification time is partly supported by the orchid fossil record, which includes leaf compressions and pollinaria dated from the early Eocene through the mid-Miocene found in different deposits (

; 

; Poinar Jr., 2016a,b; 

). Most of these fossils have been credibly assigned to subfamilies and tribes.
</p>
         <p>
An updated biogeographic study of this old, species-rich, and cosmopolitan family (
Fig. 1a–d
), which is uniquely diverse in animal and fungal interactions (

; 

; Karremans 
et al
., 2023), and adaptations to different habitats (
Fig. 1e,f
), will help our understanding of monocot clades with wide distribution ranges and diversity of adaptations (e.g. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Arecaceae (

Couvreur 
et al
., 2011

)
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bromeliaceae (
Benzing, 2000
))
</tp:taxon-name>
. Such a study can build on several in-depth analyses that have focused on subclades of orchids (

; 

; 

; 

; 

). In a benchmark study of the biogeographic history and diversification of the entire family, 

used a fossil-calibrated plastid tree for 173 genera (out of 736), representing all five subfamilies, along with 10 outgroup species representing six families (
<tp:taxon-name>Asteliaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Blandfordiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Boryaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypoxidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Lanariaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, with 
<tp:taxon-name>Iridaceae</tp:taxon-name>
as a more distant outgroup). Using a likelihood approach (

) and a single consensus ultrametric tree, their analyses relied on a matrix where terminals, usually representing genera, were coded for their entire distribution. The results pointed to an origin and initial diversification of orchids in Australia during the mid-Cretaceous, 120–90 Ma. Specifically, the range estimates for the 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
stem node indicated Australia as 
c
. 40% likely, Neotropics plus Australia as 
c
. 20%, and all other ranges together as 
c
. 40%. At 90 Ma, Australia was at high latitudes connected to Antarctica and part of the southern supercontinent, Gondwana, with connections to South America, and the authors, therefore, stressed the likely importance of expansion across Antarctica. A Gondwanan origin for 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
was also suggested by 

.
</p>
         <p>

: table 1) also addressed the correlates of diversification rates through time and inferred Southeast Asia as the region with the highest net diversification rates. Studying how diversification rates are linked to geographical variation helps us understand not only the pace at which extant species diversity has accumulated but also the correlated biotic and abiotic variables (

; 

). Although orchid species diversity clearly is unevenly distributed across their distribution (

), no study has yet assessed the relationship between the distribution of orchid species richness and underlying speciation rates at a global scale.
</p>
         <p>
Here, we revisit the biogeographic history of 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
and infer geographic patterns of speciation, using a greatly expanded taxon sampling (1921 species, 285 genera) as compared to previous studies, with a particular focus on early divergences. We generate a phylogenomic framework by combining high-throughput and Sanger sequencing data. Our spatial information derives from herbarium-vouchered, georeferenced occurrence data, sourced from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; https://www.gbif.org) and the RAINBIO mega-database (

). This dataset was further vetted using the spatial distribution data of the World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP; 

). Based on these datasets, we: (1) infer the evolutionary and biogeographical history of the orchids; (2) test the hypothesis of an Australasian origin for their most recent common ancestor; and (3) revisit the hypothesis that Southeast Asia is the region with the highest current diversification rate of orchids.

         <p>Taxon sampling, DNA library preparation and sequencing</p>
         <p>
Our phylogenomic framework was assembled using a high-throughput-sequencing dataset, complemented with Sanger data for single genes. The high-throughput-sequencing dataset focused on the genes targeted by the Angiosperms353 probe set (

; 

) and includes 448 species, representing 285/736 genera, 40/49 subtribes, 17/22 tribes, and 5/5 subfamilies (in the classification of 

). These data were generated by the Plant and Fungal Trees of Life Project (

) at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and the Genomics for Australian Plants Consortium (https://www.genomicsforaustralianplants.com/). Nineteen monocot species were included as outgroup taxa, with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dioscorea caucasica
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Dioscoreales</tp:taxon-name>
) used as a rooting terminal, for a total of 467 species in the high-throughput-sequencing dataset. Illumina sequencing reads were newly produced for 377 samples (vs 

) from expertly curated specimens housed in the Kew (K) and Australian National Herbarium (CANB),
</p>
         <p>including 23 species sampled from type material and silica-gel dried tissue (Supporting Information Table S1).</p>
         <p>
DNA extraction was conducted from 1.5 to 4 mg of silica-dried fresh tissue or herbarium specimen tissue, constituting leaf or occasionally flower. We used a sterile steel bead for mechanical disruption in a SPEX 
®
sample prep tissue homogeniser (SPEX Inc., Metusen NJ, USA), applying two to four disruption cycles of 1 min at 1350 Hz. Next, we added 750 µl CTAB with 2% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol (

) for a 30-min incubation at 65°C, followed by either a 4 h incubation at 57°C (silica-dried samples) or an overnight incubation at 57°C (herbarium specimens). We then added 750 µl SEVAG (24: 1 chloroform: isoamyl alcohol), placed the samples on a shaking incubator for 30 min, and centrifuged the samples to induce phase separation. Next, we separated off the upper phase containing the DNA fraction and added to this a 0.7X volume of isopropanol for a 4–5-d incubation at ¯20°C to encourage DNA precipitation. Finally, we subjected the samples to two rounds of centrifugation and supernatant removal, first to remove the isopropanol and second to wash the DNA pellet with 75% ethanol. Subsequently, the DNA pellet was eluted into 70 µl 10 mM Tris-Cl and purified using a paramagnetic bead clean-up method with a 2: 1 ratio of Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) to DNA elution. To gauge the size distribution of the genomic DNA and, on this basis, determine which samples might need shearing before library preparation, we visualised the samples on a 1% agarose gel. Using 18–200 ng starting material, we prepared DNA libraries using NEB Next Ultra II Library Prep Kits (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol, but with half-volume reactions. Where possible (silica-dried material and herbarium specimens with DNA of higher integrity), we aimed for insert sizes of 
c
. 350 bp, by shearing the DNA with a Covaris ME220 Focussed Ultrasonicator (Covaris LLC, Woburn, MA, USA). The libraries were indexed with NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (New England Biolabs) and amplified using 6–14 PCR cycles. The yield was estimated using a Quantus fluorometer (Promega), and fragment size distribution was estimated using either a 4200 TapeStation system or an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyser (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Finally, we used the Angiosperms353 probe set to enrich these genomic libraries for 353 low-copy nuclear genes (

), modifying the equimolar pooling of libraries into groups of 10–20 libraries per capture reaction and total input of up to 1 µg. Furthermore, for the herbarium samples, we applied a lowered hybridisation temperature – of 62°C and a prolonged hybridisation time – of 40 h. The sequencing of paired-end genomic libraries (150 bp X 2) was conducted on an Illumina HiSeq by Macrogen (Geumcheon, South Korea).
</p>
         <p>
The Sanger sequencing dataset was assembled through the SuperCRUNCH pipeline (

). This pipeline was executed using an initial set of 24 172 sequences of the nuclear ribosomal ITS and the plastid 
mat
K markers – two commonly sequenced, informative loci for 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
and other angiosperms (Grace 
et al
., 2021) – obtained from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore). The following parameters were used: (1) search terms of ‘ITS; ITS1; ITS2; internal transcribed spacer 1; partial sequence; 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene; complete sequence; internal transcribed spacer 2’ for ITS, and ‘ 
matK
; 
trnK
; maturase K; 
trnK
gene, intron; and maturase K 
matK
gene’ for 
matK
; (2) a list of 285 generic (accepted) names that were sampled in the high-throughput-sequencing dataset; (3) similarity searches between sequences using MEGABLAST (

), retaining a maximum of 200 hits per search. After removing duplicated sequences and obvious contaminants (defined as sequences with misplaced positions given current taxonomic views), we retained sequences of nrITS and plastid 
matK
for 2060 species, of which 64% had sequences produced from the same voucher specimen (Table S2).
</p>
         <p>High-throughput and Sanger sequencing data analyses</p>
         <p>
Illumina libraries were quality-assessed with 
FASTQC
software v.0.11 (available at https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac. uk/projects/fastqc/). Paired-end reads were quality-filtered and adapter-trimmed using 

TRIMGALORE

! v.0.6.4 available at (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore), using the following parameters: (1) 
-q 30
(
<tp:taxon-name>minimum Phred</tp:taxon-name>
score), (2) 
length
20 (minimum read length), (3) retaining read pairs that passed the quality thresholds. 
In silico
retrieval of the Angiosperms353 coding loci was conducted using the pipeline 

HYBPIPER

v.2.1.6 (

) and the same parameters and software described in 

; also see Methods S1). Next, low-copy nuclear and Sanger markers were aligned using the software 
MAFFT
v.7.4 (

) in conjunction with the iterative refinement method FFT-NS-I, implementing a maximum of 1000 iterations. To ameliorate potential bias introduced by missing data in phylogenetic analyses, sequences shorter than 50% of the total alignment length were excluded. Subsequently, alignments were filtered for misaligned positions using 
TAPER
v.1.0 (

), with a cut-off value of 1 (flag 
–c
), and inspected by eye with 
GENEIOUS
v.8.0 (available at https://www.geneious.com/). The Sanger/Angiosperms353 nucleotide alignments are accessible at doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare.22245940.
</p>
         <p>Distance-based, maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and multispecies coalescence phylogenomic inferences</p>
         <p>
We computed maximum likelihood (ML) trees from the individual Sanger and Angiosperms353 nucleotide alignments using 
RAXML
v.8.0 (

) with 500 rapid bootstrap replicates (flags 
-#
500 and 
-x
) and the GTR+ Γ nucleotide substitution model. Additionally, a multispecies coalescent (MSC) tree was inferred from the individual Angiosperms353 gene trees produced by 

RAXML

using the software 
ASTRAL-
III v.5.6 (

) and the flag – 
t
2 (full tree annotation), after collapsing bipartitions with a likelihood bootstrap percentage (LBP) &lt;20% (achieved with the function new_ed of the package 
newick_utils
v.1.6.0, available at https://bioweb.pasteur.fr/ packages/pack@newick-utils@1.6). To visualise the proportion of gene tree quartets that agreed with the species tree, we produced quartet support pie charts for every branch represented in the species tree, using the full annotation produced by 
ASTRALIII
. We also visualised the proportion of gene trees in agreement with each species’ tree bipartition using 
PHYPARTS
v.1.0, by labelling as informative any gene tree bipartition with a LBP&gt; 20% (

).
</p>
         <p>
Because of the overall topological congruence between the ITS- and 
matK
-derived trees and the Angiosperms353 low-copy nuclear MSC trees, as well as a goodness-of-fit test (

; 

, see Methods S1; Notes S1), we proceeded to compute ML phylogenetic trees from: a supermatrix derived by concatenating the ITS and 
matK
sequences; and a supermatrix derived from the concatenation of the Angiosperms353 loci, again using 
RAXML
v.8.0 with the same settings previously specified, considering each of the two supermatrices as a single partition. Lastly, we inferred a consensus network using the 500 
RAXML
bootstrap replicates produced from the Angiosperms353 supermatrix and 

SPLITSTREE

v.4.0 (

), with a mean edge weight and a threshold value of 0.75 to filter out any splits not found in at least 75% of the bootstrap trees. The trees and consensus network are accessible at doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare.22245940.
</p>
         <p>Molecular-clock-dating analyses and species-level phylogeny assembly</p>
         <p>
Absolute age estimation analysis was conducted in two stages using the Bayesian framework implemented in 
BEAST
v.2.6 (

), as follows:
</p>
         <p>
(
1
) The backbone was inferred by subsampling the Angiosperms353 low-copy nuclear gene alignments using 

SORTADATE

v.1.0 (

). Here, we selected the top 25 low-copy nuclear gene alignments with the lowest root-to-tip variance coefficient (i.e. highest clock-likeness). This selection ensured the representation of the entire generic diversity as sampled by the ML high-throughput dataset (i.e. 285 genera; see Methods S1; Tables S3, S4). This data subset was imported in 
BEAUTI

The proportion of informative and missing sequences per taxon sample is provided in Table S4. Finally, the support for the backbone ultrametric trees derived from BEAST was assessed by first computing a maximum credibility consensus tree from the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior trees using 

TREEANNOTATOR

v.2.6 (https://www.beast2.org/treeannotator/), using a burn-in threshold of 10%, and then counting the proportion of bipartitions falling on different support intervals.

(

) A species-level-ultrametric phylogeny of 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
was produced by inputting the ITS and 
matK
alignments as unlinked partitions in 
BEAUTI
v.2.6 (

), using the same priors as in (1). Furthermore, the ML consensus phylogram produced in RAxML v.8.0 from the ITS- 
matK
supermatrix was used as a starting tree.
</p>
         <p>
(

) To try to accommodate phylogenetic uncertainty, we constructed 10 ultrametric species trees through a novel pipeline (
Fig. 2
) instead of using a single consensus maximum clade credibility tree. We first randomly sampled 10 posterior trees derived from the BEAST analyses conducted on the genus-level Angiosperms353 and the ITS- 
matK
Sanger species-level datasets. Then, for each genus represented in the Angiosperms353 chronograms, we pruned its counterpart clade sampled on the species-level Sanger chronogram and proceeded to graft it onto the corresponding stem of the Angiosperms353 chronogram. This operation was conducted on each pair of randomly sampled posterior trees (hence called posterior probability (PP) species trees). A detailed description of the pipeline is provided in the Methods S1.
</p>
         <p>Biogeographic analyses</p>
         <p>
Biogeographical state estimations were conducted on the 10 PP species trees (see previous section). We estimated areas of origin and geographic range using the ML approach of dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC, 

) as implemented in the C++ version (

). We relied on DEC because in its C++ implementation, is a model that is scalable to the number of terminals and biogeographical areas that our study involves and because it models the main biogeographic phenomena that could have shaped the range evolution of the orchid family at higher taxonomic levels. The eight geographic areas considered were: (1) Palearctic, defined as Europe, Siberia, Central Asia, and Western Asia; (2) Nearctic, including all North America to the north of Tehuantepec in Mexico and excluding the southern tip of Florida; (3) Neotropics, including Central America, the Caribbean Islands, and South America; (4) Africa, defined as the whole African continent including Madagascar, and Arabian Peninsula; (5) Indomalaya, including India, southern China, and Wallacea; and (6) Australasia, defined as everything east of HeilprinLydekker’s Line (

). A time-stratified geographic model specified constraints on area connectivity by coding 0 if any two areas were not connected or 1 if they were connected during a given period based on paleogeographic reconstructions. Our first time slice covered the Late Cretaceous and early Palaeocene (100.5–60 Ma), corresponding to a time when Gondwana and Laurasia had already separated (

). The second time slice covered the late Paleocene to early Oligocene (60–30 Ma), and the third the early Oligocene to the present (30– 0 Ma). To avoid biased results supporting ancestral areas in favour of hyperdiverse biomes, our sampling per biogeographic area used proportional sampling that reflected known diversity across biogeographic realms, with the Asian and American tropics hosting the highest levels of species richness (

). Our analyses included 905 species distributed in the Neotropics (6% of total known diversity in the area; 

), 623 from the Indomalaya region (6%), 347 from the Palearctic (5%), 221 from the Afrotropics (9%), 180 from Australasia (15%), and 44 from the Nearctic (10%).
</p>
         <p>Spatial analysis of species diversity and speciation rates</p>
         <p>
We queried 29 524 accepted orchid species names obtained from the WCVP through the GBIF (https://www.gbif.org/) and RAINBIO (https://gdauby.github.io/rainbio/index.html; 

) databases. Our initial step involved accessing the GBIF database through the R package SPOCC (available at https://github.com/ropensci/spocc). Using the 
occ
function, we downloaded up to 1000 records for each queried species name, ensuring that we only selected records linked to geographical coordinates and preserved specimens. The RAINBIO repository was manually accessed. Next, we conducted an automated filtering using the 

SPECIESGEOCODER

package (T€ opel 
et al
., 2017) to exclude duplicated records and those located within urban areas. Subsequently, we removed occurrences that fell outside global coastlines. Lastly, to mitigate the influence of misidentified records on downstream analyses (Maldonado 
et al
., 2015), we filtered out records for which the distribution did not match with the species distribution per botanical country (level 3 of the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions; 

) provided by the WCVP. The original record database sourced from GBIF is available at doi: 10.15468/dl. v2gwxv, and the filtered geographical records used in all downstream analyses will be available at doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare. 22245940.
</p>
         <p>
Estimating net diversification rates (speciation (
ƛ
) minus extinction (
µ
)) in plant lineages remains challenging (

). Our approach focuses on speciation dynamics, as inferred from tip 
ƛ
rates. This metric represents contemporary rates of speciation for a given lineage and is less prone to bias than net diversification rates (

). To obtain tip 
ƛ
rates, we fitted a time-dependent model using 
BAMM
v.2.5.0 (

). This was informed by sampling fractions, contrasting accepted species number per genus from the WCVP database with the number of species sampled in our phylogenetic analyses. Here, 54% of the genera sampled included sequences from 10 to 50% of their known species, 21% included&gt; 50%, and 25% included &lt;10% of their known species. This analysis was conducted on each of the 10 PP species trees generated by pruning and grafting the genus- and species-level chronograms produced by BEAST. We initially computed prior values for the initial 
ƛ
and shift parameters, using the R package 
BAMMTOOLS
(

), and performed 10 million generations, sampling the MCMC simulations every 10 000 generations. The BAMM output was analysed in BAMMtools to ensure that all analyses reached convergence (ESS values&gt; 100). Mean speciation rates at present time (
ƛ
tip rates) were extracted for all terminals of the phylogenetic trees using the 
getTipRates
function in BAMMtools, and then linked to the filtered geographical species occurrences.
</p>
         <p>
Global patterns of species richness were inferred by calculating the average number of species per political and botanical country, and per grid cell (100 km X 100 km), using the filtered occurrence records and the average and maximum 
ƛ
rate values per grid cell. All calculations were performed in the open-source software 
QGIS
v.3.0 (available at https://www.qgis.org/ en/site/forusers/download.html) and the R package 
KEWR
(

).

         <p>A new phylogenomic framework for the orchid family</p>
         <p>
This study combines high-throughput data with Sanger sequencing data to achieve denser taxon sampling at relatively low cost. Our MSC and ML analyses yielded a well-supported phylogenomic framework for the 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, containing 38% of the currently accepted orchid genera (
Figs 3
, S 
1–S
8; see Notes S1). The 10 posterior probability (PP) species trees showed no major conflicts with the MSC tree produced in ASTRAL, with the sole exception of the position of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Corymborkis
</tp:taxon-name>
, which in some instances was recovered as nested within tribe 
<tp:taxon-name>Gastrodieae</tp:taxon-name>
(Figs S7, S8). Please refer to the Discussion section below for a detailed comparison of our topology with earlier phylogenomic studies.
</p>
         <p>
Our results reveal the placements of the monospecific genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cooktownia
D.L.Jones (Orchidoideae)
</tp:taxon-name>
and the small genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Claderia
</tp:taxon-name>
(two species; Epidendroideae), distributed, respectively, from the western Indian Ocean to the western Pacific and from the south-western Pacific to New Zealand. Previous classifications had placed 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cooktownia robertsii
</tp:taxon-name>
in the tribe 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchideae</tp:taxon-name>
, based on stigmatic chamber characters (

). Our findings now show that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cooktownia
</tp:taxon-name>
is most closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Habenaria
Willd.
</tp:taxon-name>
, an almost cosmopolitan genus from subtribe 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchidinae</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Claderia viridiflora
</tp:taxon-name>
had been included in the predominantly African subtribe 
<tp:taxon-name>Eulophiinae</tp:taxon-name>
based on morphological similarities in the gynostemium and unpublished nrITS sequences (

). Our data place 
<tp:taxon-name>
Claderia
</tp:taxon-name>
as sister to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Agrostophyllum
Blume
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Earina
Lindl. (Agrostophyllinae, Epidendreae)
</tp:taxon-name>
, based on sequences from the type specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Claderia viridiflora
</tp:taxon-name>
collected in 1867. Though the Angiosperms353 gene recovery was predictably low for this old specimen, we successfully identified 40 genes, with 23 being informative (Table S1). The placement as sister to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Agrostophyllum
</tp:taxon-name>
was also found by 

based on plastid genomes and the nrITS loci.

         <p>
Molecular clock dating and biogeographic reconstructions point to a Laurasian origin of 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
during the Late Cretaceous
</p>
         <p>
Our molecular clock models (Materials and Methods section) estimated the stem age of 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
to 120 + 6 Ma (Fig. S7) and the crown age as 83 + 10 Ma, corresponding to the Early and Late Cretaceous, respectively. The results also indicate that most orchid species originated over the past 5 million years (Fig. S9). Comparison of stem ages and tip branch lengths derived from the Angiosperm353 chronograms and crown node ages of the Sanger chronograms indicated that age discordance between both datasets was minimal (Methods S1; Figs S10, S11), thus suggesting that absolute ages obtained from the 10 posterior probability trees were reliable. Seven of the 10 biogeographical reconstructions (conducted on the 10 PP species trees) supported Laurasia (Nearctic + Palearctic) as the place of origin for the most recent common ancestor of orchids (relative probability = 0.15– 0.30; Table S5; 
Fig. 4a
). The three others supported Laurasia + Neotropics or Gondwana (Neotropics + Australasia + Antarctica) as the most likely place of origin for the most recent common ancestor of orchids (relative probability = 0.14–0.19), followed by Laurasia (relative probability = 0.14–0.18; Table S5).
</p>
         <p>
Subsequent colonisation of other biogeographical realms apparently occurred through long-distance dispersals, for example, from Indomalaya to the Afrotropics in tribe 
<tp:taxon-name>Vandeae</tp:taxon-name>
(Epidendroideae) between 35 and 10 Ma, or through stepping-stone processes from the Palearctic and Nearctic to the Neotropics in tribe 
<tp:taxon-name>Cymbidieae</tp:taxon-name>
(Epidendroideae, 30–20 Ma). The early diversification of Orchidoideae appears to have taken place 55–40 Ma, with dispersals to Australasia and the Palearctic and subsequent 
in situ
Neotropical diversifications (e.g. Cranichidinae), Nearctic (Spiranthinae), Paleartic, Indomalaya (
<tp:taxon-name>Goodyerinae</tp:taxon-name>
) and Afrotropics (e.g. Disinae).
</p>
         <p>Orchid speciation in space and time</p>
         <p>
We downloaded 795 735 records from the GBIF and RAINBIO repositories of which 495 755 accessions were retained after filtering out duplicate records and inaccurate distributions 
sensu
the WCVP database (see Materials and Methods section). Analyses of political country species richness indicated that Ecuador, Colombia, and Papua New Guinea are the top three countries in terms of species richness. Notably, seven out of 10 most orchid species-rich countries are located in the Neotropics. Analyses based on the botanical country species richness (as inferred from the WCVP) yielded similar results (
Figs 5a
, insert, S12; Table S6). An analysis of species richness per grid cell derived from the curated GBIF-RAINBIO dataset showed that Central America (especially Costa Rica) and the northern Andean region (particularly Ecuador and Colombia) have the highest levels of species richness. These geographical patterns of species richness are in agreement with the species richness distributions independently obtained through the WCVP database and support findings of studies conducted at the family level (

) and in Orchidoideae (

).
</p>
         <p>
Geographical speciation (
ƛ
) patterns, as informed from tip 
ƛ
rates, did not always coincide with the areas of highest current species richness. Notably, when considering minimum and maximum values of speciation rates, virtually all ecoregions assessed here had one- or even two-fold variation in their speciation rates (
Fig. 5c
, inset). Our speciation rate analyses unveiled multiple accelerations within each subfamily with the fastest tip rates in Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae, starting from the early Miocene (
Fig. 6a
). These shifts coincided with the initial diversification of species-rich genera such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Maxillaria
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dendrobium
</tp:taxon-name>
. In other instances, however, rate increases preceded the divergence of species-rich and depauperate clades as seen with 

<tp:taxon-name>Lepanthes</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Lepanthopsis</tp:taxon-name>

or occurred within genera like 

<tp:taxon-name>Bulbophyllum</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Habenaria</tp:taxon-name>

. The lineages with the highest speciation rates are Neotropical epiphytes, including the tribe 
<tp:taxon-name>Epidendreae</tp:taxon-name>
, and the subtribes Maxillariinae and Oncidiinae. The sole exceptions to this trend are the nearly cosmopolitan terrestrial genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Habenaria
(

Batista 
et al
., 2011

)
</tp:taxon-name>
and the genera 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bulbophyllum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dendrobium
</tp:taxon-name>
, which are mostly epiphytic and distributed mainly in tropical Asia (
Fig. 6b
, 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
The most rapidly speciating lineages predominantly occur in south-eastern Central America where they span diverse habitats, from lowland dry and wet forests through cloud forests to high-elevation grasslands, as exemplified by genera like 
<tp:taxon-name>
Epidendrum

Discussion
</p>
         <p>Congruence of our global orchid phylogenomic framework with recent orchid phylogenomic studies</p>
         <p>
The relationships among subfamilies and tribes found here largely agree with the findings of 

, a study that used between 639 and 1195 nuclear genes from 610 species representing 297 genera. Notable exceptions include the monophyly of 
<tp:taxon-name>Bletiinae</tp:taxon-name>
within 
<tp:taxon-name>Epidendreae</tp:taxon-name>
, and the position of Eriopsidinae within 
<tp:taxon-name>Cymbidieae</tp:taxon-name>
(fig. S2 in 

). A detailed view of the summary trees produced by 

reveals evidence of intragenomic conflicts (see fig. S3 in 

): 46 bipartitions in the MSC trees attained low local posterior probabilities (&lt;0.5), and LBPs (&lt;70%), suggesting that dominant alternative relationships exist for the branches in question. 

recovered the subtribe 
<tp:taxon-name>Bletiinae</tp:taxon-name>
as paraphyletic (i.e. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bletia
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chysis
</tp:taxon-name>
as successive sisters to Ponerinae, Laeliinae and Pleurothallidinae), a relationship also found, albeit with low support, by 

and 

. Unfortunately, voucher information and corresponding sequencing data of 

, first available online on February 2023) have not been made publicly available (at the time of writing), which limits the extent to which these phylogenomic discrepancies can be evaluated (PRJNA923320 accession code, queried on 26 November 2023 in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, returned zero results).

A Laurasian, Cretaceous origin of 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
         </p>
         <p>
Our dating and biogeographic analyses inferred an origin of orchids in the late Cretaceous, in agreement with previous estimates (

; 

; 

; 

; 

), and suggested Laurasia as the likely place of initial diversification of the family. This matches the important role that Laurasia played during the late Cretaceous, fostering the initial diversification of many tropical and warm-temperate flowering plant and animal lineages. Notable examples include the palm family 
<tp:taxon-name>
Arecaceae (
Baker &amp; Couvreur, 2012
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and the yams, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dioscorea
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Dioscoreaceae</tp:taxon-name>
: 

). During the late Cretaceous, Laurasian angiosperms were mostly herbs to small trees with early successional strategies restricted to unstable habitats (

; 

). Subsequently, throughout the Paleogene, much of Laurasia had a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate that supported closed canopy, broad-leaved deciduous angiosperm forests that extended into high paleolatitudes beyond the Arctic Circle (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Proposing an initial diversification of the orchids in Laurasia contrasts with prior inferences of an Australian origin of the family, followed by entry into the Neotropics via Antarctica (
Fig. 4b
; 

). Those results were due mostly to the outgroup sampling, which used nine species as representatives of 
<tp:taxon-name>Asteliaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Blandfordiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Boryaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypoxidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Lanariaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(most of them from Australia), plus one species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Iridaceae</tp:taxon-name>
. The orchid stem node was, therefore, placed in Australia with a likelihood of 
c
. 40%, in Australia + the Neotropics (linked via Antarctica) with 
c
. 20%, and in other ranges with together 
c
. 40%. Their orchid crown node was placed in Australia with a likelihood of 
c
. 20%, in Australia + the Neotropics with 
c
. 30%, and in all other ranges with together 
c
. 50%. Our broader sampling of orchid groups and biogeographic analyses on multiple trees may lead to less phylogenetic and geographic uncertainty (

).
</p>
         <p>
The subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Apostasioideae</tp:taxon-name>
, sister to all other 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
and comprising only 16 species in two genera distributed in Japan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Southeast Asia, New Guinea and northern Australia (

; Li 
et al
., 2023), is here interpreted as having a relictual range. This would mirror the relictual ranges of numerous other plant groups that were widespread in the Eocene in Eurasia, but which survive only in tropical Southeast Asia today (

; 

). The pattern is known from at least 50 groups of gymnosperms and angiosperms that formerly occurred in Europe and/or North America (

). Another example in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
of an ancient relictual range is the subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>Cypripedioideae</tp:taxon-name>
(slipper orchids), with five genera and 169 extant species (136 Old World and 33 New World). The ancestor of the slipper orchids likely had a continuous distribution in the boreotropics from where slipper orchids migrated southwards to both sides of the Pacific Ocean due to the climate cooling in the late Cenozoic (

; 
Fig. 4
).
</p>
         <p>
The Indomalayan region harbours 
c
. 30% of the extant orchid species, mostly within the Epidendroideae. The so-far oldest orchid fossil is a hard epidendroid pollinarium found attached to a fungus gnat preserved in Baltic amber, dated to 55–40 Ma (

), documenting the presence of Epidendroideae at high latitudes in the early Eocene. During this period, evergreen forests covered northern Europe (

</p>
         <p>A Central American hotspot of orchid speciation</p>
         <p>
The discrepancy between the orchid’s extent species richness and speciation rates agrees with the findings of a broad-scale study on global plant diversification rates and species richness, which are often unlinked (

). The low ƛ tip rates in Australia can be attributed to the predominance of terrestrial orchids in southern Australia (

), which tend to have lower speciation rates than epiphytic orchids (

). Contrary to the findings of 

, the northern Andes do not appear to host the fastest speciating orchid clades in the American tropics despite being one of the most species-rich areas world-wide (

; 

). Instead, southern Mesoamerica, comprising the moist and seasonal forests of Costa Rica and Panama, has the highest orchid speciation rates per grid cell, matching its outstandingly high levels of species richness also of other groups (

; 

; 

; 
Fig. 5c
; Table S7).
</p>
         <p>
Central American cloud forests and high-elevation grasslands are of Pliocene origin, making them some of the youngest Neotropical biomes (

). The Late Cenozoic shallow subduction of the young hotspot Cocos ridge under the Panama block (part of the Caribbean plate) is controlling the rapid uplift of the Cordillera de Talamanca in south-eastern Costa Rica and eastern Panama (

). This ongoing process started between 5.5 and 3.5 Ma (

), with elevated mountain uplift rates of 
c
. 1 km per 1 Ma (

). The rapid creation of mountain ranges and valleys under a tropical climate could generate multiple microhabitats that might have enhanced speciation rates. Additionally, the geographic position of Costa Rica and Panama acts as a biological crossroads between the two biodiversity hotspots of northern Mesoamerica and the northern Andes, resulting in the current coexistence of northern and southern groups (

; 

). These findings support and expand the hypothesis of Central American tropical forests having evolved rapidly and recently (

). Nevertheless, although our analyses of geographical speciation rates offer new perspectives on the evolution of orchid diversity, we urge caution in interpreting the relationship between 
ƛ
and species richness (

). Additionally, our taxon sampling and species-level spatial distributions are likely biased due to uneven collection efforts in certain regions, such as the historically understudied New Guinea (

).
</p>
         <p>Conclusions</p>
         <p>
This study places the initial diversification of orchids in Laurasia during the Late Cretaceous (83 + 10 Ma) and interprets the modern geographic range of 
<tp:taxon-name>Apostasioideae</tp:taxon-name>
, comprising 16 species in Southeast Asia and Northern Australasia, as relictual. The presence of 
<tp:taxon-name>Orchidaceae</tp:taxon-name>
in Eurasia and North America during the Paleogene, followed by extinction and survival in more southern regions resembles the history of at least 50 genera of seed plants that once occurred in Eurasia, but survive with just a few species in tropical Southeast Asia. We reject the hypothesis that Southeast Asia is the region with highest orchid speciation rates (

). Instead, our results show that southern Central America, which contains 4.5% of the world’s flora and fauna in just 0.5% of its land surface, has been a hotspot for orchid speciation since the Pliocene with the highest speciation rates per grid cell on a global scale.
