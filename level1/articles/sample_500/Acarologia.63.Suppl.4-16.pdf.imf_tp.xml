Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Three free-living astigmatid mite species can be found co-occurring in 
UK
beehives: 
<tp:taxon-name>
Carpolyphus lactis
(Linnaeus)
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Carpoglyphidae</tp:taxon-name>
), 
<tp:taxon-name>
Glycyphagus domesticus
(De Geer)
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Glycyphagidae</tp:taxon-name>
), and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Tyrophagus putrescentiae
(Schrank)
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Acaridae</tp:taxon-name>
). In terms of comparative idiosomal size across a wide variety of free-living forms, 

categorised all three of these
</p>
         <p>
as having an interstitial, potential cavity-living habit. Zoology is beset by ‘just-so stories’ whereby observational claims are made in support of various philosophies. As 

outlines, mite cheliceral chelae as tools differ in gross form, which may or may not be related ecomorphologically to particular lifestyles. What is crucially important in accepting any such explanations is that quantitatively they make sense. That is, the physical working of features
</p>
         <p>
is numerically consilient with any posed function. As 

says: “…biologists have changed, and the way they approach their science is getting closer and closer to the world of engineers, in terms of concepts, language and methods”.
</p>
         <p>

reported 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. putrescentiae
</tp:taxon-name>
to be an excavating geophage. The question arises that if all free-living astigmatids use their cheliceral chelae to do such digging, how big
</p>
         <p>a bite could each species take? Furthermore, for any of an interstitial, potential cavity-living habit, how long is such a mite likely to take to dig out a hole large enough to hide in? This requires one to estimate: the span (i.e., the effective gape) of a maximally open chela, the size</p>
         <p>
of the mastication surface with which the moveable digit rests upon any material and generates friction, and the bite size when a moveable digit surface grasps into material. A check will also be made that variation in these parameters is consilient with previous attribution of feeding design using the ontology of 

and thus if the three co-occurring species could
</p>
         <p>avoid trophic competition by mechanical design.</p>

</p>
         <p>Drawings were scanned using a HP OfficeJet Pro 8720 and digitised measurements of:</p>
         <p>
IL, setal lengths D1, D2 and L2; chelal design (L1U, L2M, CHI, CLI following (

); and, cheliceral dentition [x,y] profiles with respect to the condyle-to-tip L2M axis
</p>
         <p>
were made using ImageJ 
1.51s
ex National Institutes of Health 
USA
(available from http: //imagej.nih.gov.uk/ij). Mite chelae were orientated by reflection and rotation such that their adductive lever moment arm directions (i.e., L2M see 

were aligned.
</p>
         <p>
Two fixed homologous features (the moveable digit tip and the fixed digit to moveable digit articulating condyle) were used for registration (
Figure 1
) i.e., the L2M axis is the ‘reference line’. One landmark, the moveable digit tip, labeled (1) plus seventeen semi-landmarks (labeled 2–18) were determined by first scaling each L2M axis to the same size (rooted on the condyle) and then overlaying a equi-spaced 2D grid in order to digitise the moveable digit profile (black line in 
Figure 2
) at standard increments along the L2M axis. Semi-landmark 18 was that directly vertical above the centre of the condyle seen laterally. This was not necessarily exactly where the adductive tendon inserts into the ‘coronoid process’ of the moveable digit (that is the length of y 
18
after undoing the rescaling does not necessarily match L1U). The moveable digit tip was taken to be the origin i.e., [x=0, y=0]. It is understood that a grid space of 1 indicates a slightly different actual spacing in µm for different specimens, but this is not about defining universal landmarks rather it is to deploy digit length adjusted semi-landmarks comparable across chelal designs.

Chelal velocity ratio

         <p>
The velocity ratio (= the ideal mechanical advantage) at the cheliceral chelal tip of the moveable digit (VR 
tip
) was calculated as 
𝐿2𝑀
𝐿1𝑈
(i.e., the length of the input moment arm divided by the length of the output moment arm of the closing adductive lever (

         <p>
Span of moveable digit
</p>
         <p>
The span of the moveable digit (or maximum effective chelal gape) is that distance from the end of moveable digit mastication surface to the fixed digit tip where any force at the end of moveable digit mastication surface is resisted by the fixed digit tip i.e Ӽ. = 𝐿2𝑀 ∗ ԢԘ𝑛 (𝛿). That is, given that the chelal tips meet, it is commensurate with a force orthogonal to L2M being applied (see 
Figure 1
).
</p>
         <p>
Sclerotisation/strengthening
</p>
         <p>
The degree of comparative strengthening by sclerotisation of the condyle and of the moveable digit was scored numerically on a subjective scale (0 = not or feebly sclerotised, 1 = pale but sclerotised, 2 = brown moderately well sclerotised, 3 = dark brown heavily sclerotised) using specimens from

of a bite or ‘grab’ at the maximum effective gape G (see 
Figure 1
) that could be gripped before any such truncation, would be by taking a cone of 2D apex angle

) ∗ (𝐿2𝑀

𝑖𝑒
) 
3
). This
</p>
         <p>is an overestimate as although chelicerae can be approximated as cylinders, the chelal digits themselves are somewhat flattened. It also infers that the lateral truncation of grasped food preferentially occurs distal to the condyle. It represents the maximum chunk that might be torn away by a bite from that mite’s single chelicera.</p>
         <p>
Morsel size pre-ingestion
</p>
         <p>
If the thickness (denoted 
thick
) in μm of chelal digits were known then an estimate of
</p>
         <p>food fragment size after hypostomal truncation (= pre-ingestion morsel size) would be</p>
         <p>
= (ԣℎԘԒԚ) ∗ 
2
𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝛿)
∗ 𝑥 
𝑖𝑒
∗ ((2 ∗ 𝐿2𝑀) − 𝑥 
𝑖𝑒
) assuming that the rutella are held running along either side of the digits.
</p>
         <p>
Digit effective thickness might be estimated basally at the condyle (= a constant spacing between the rutellae) or distally at the tip (i.e., the rutellae flexibly press outwards during cheliceral protrusion and then press inwards on retraction so that the minimum gap is the important parameter). Taking the first approach, 

shows a SEM of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Blomia tropicalis
</tp:taxon-name>
gnathosoma end-on from the front. From this, the ratio of moveable digit width (basally near the estimated position of the condyle) to cheliceral width (basally) can be estimated as 0.29. This closely agrees with 

where for 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. putrescentiae
</tp:taxon-name>
the ratio is approximately 0.28. Using digit thickness at the condyle as indicative of food fragment width after truncation by the rutellae appears reasonable (rather than using the digit width distally) when for instance the magnitude of the intra-pedipalp gap is considered (see gnathosoma of

Food fragments are dragged alternately by each chelicera into the labral area between the palps. The equivalent ratios for

A. siro
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. gracilis
</tp:taxon-name>

were estimated
</p>
         <p>
as 0.29 and 0.32 respectively. However, Ahamad 
et al.
(2011) shows an SEM of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Suidasia pontifica
</tp:taxon-name>
where this ratio could be estimated somewhat higher at 0.39. Taking the cheliceral digit thickness estimated from various not quite ‘face-on’ scanning electron micrographs of another 46 astigmatid gnathosomal exemplars found on Internet web pages (covering 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. siro
</tp:taxon-name>
, ‘cheese-mite’, ‘(house) dust mites’, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Schwiebia
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
, and ‘unknown’) yields an average figure
</p>
         <p>
of 0.36. Combining these with the named examples in the above papers yields a consensus estimate of 0.35. This compares favourably with that of the highly derived astigmatids living in water-filled treeholes by 

. That paper yields an estimate of 0.37 for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Naiadacarus arboricola
</tp:taxon-name>
(although that for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Algophagus pennsylvanicus
</tp:taxon-name>
at 0.50 is somewhat higher).
</p>
         <p>

suggests that the width of cheliceral segments are about 0.85 times the height of cheliceral segments i.e., they are sub-cylindrical. Accordingly for this study herein (where CHI was measured on each specimen), moveable digit thickness (
thick
) is estimated as = 0.85 ∗ 0.35 ∗ 𝐶ӽӾ = 0.298 ∗ 𝐶ӽӾ.

End of mastication surface
</p>
         <p>The location of maximum jerk on the profile of the chelal moveable digit indicated the end of the mastication surface. In a few mites (marked with *) this was inconsistent and the end of mastication surface was taken to be the semi-landmark before that showing maximum curvature. Overall, the end of the mastication surface is confirmed to be just before the theoretical cut-off point for a functioning chewing ‘machine’ (i.e, where the velocity ratio would be =1).</p>
         <p>
Span of moveable digit
</p>
         <p>The largest and smallest span of the moveable digit surface which can grasp material (i.e., the largest and smallest effective gape of a maximally open chela) are respectively, 28.7 μm</p>
         <p>
(
<tp:taxon-name>
C. lactis
</tp:taxon-name>
) and 24.8 μm (
<tp:taxon-name>
T. putrescentiae
</tp:taxon-name>
). Note that although the adductive muscle tendon (inserting around semi-landmark 18 and pulling approximately parallel to L2M axis – would have to flex around it), the coronoid process does not impinge internally upon the dorsum of the chelal shaft. Forces for moveable digit features distal of the end of the mastication surface when maximally open would have no opposition from the fixed digit.

Free-living astigmatids in being saprophagous must be challenged to eat nematodes, nematode eggs, fungal spores and hyphae along with their base foodstuff in the wild (even in beehives). 
Figure 3
shows values of average x 
ie
for the wild-collected samples of the three taxa versus the typical sizes for spore, fungal, yeast, plant and animal cells.
</p>
         <p>
Fungal spores vary in general size from 2 to ≈ 100 μm (illustrated in 

although some can be as large as 250 μm (

). Most typical soil fungal spores (and even small protists (

)) therefore could be grasped by the chela of all three mite species. Fungal (mycorihizal) hyphae are commonly 5−10 μm but can be as small as 3−8 μm in diameter (

). Therefore, the chela of the three 
UK
beehive-living species could grab these too. Note that in extreme cases fungal hyphae can be even as low as 2 μm in size or as large as 
1 mm
. Protozoa, rotifers, tardigrades and nematodes are 4−200 μm in size meaning that some of these could be grasped (even anecdotally) by these astigmatids. Soil nematodes are non-segmented worms typically 50 μm (range 15–100 μm) in diameter. Some of these (&lt;20 μm diameter) could be grasped by the scale of mastication surfaces in the three 
UK
beehive species. Entomophagous nematodes are known to attack astigmatids (

). Their use in plant protection can expose bees to them (

). Plant parasitic worms can be much bigger, 2,000 μm or more in length (

) and are thus unlikely to be consumed if accidentally found in the hive.

Carpoglyphus lactis

as well as being a pest of stored products of high sugar content is strongly pollenophagous in the wild (Vijaykumar 
et al.
2013). Pollen has a high protein content (up to 35% (

)) but in comparison to flower nectar or honey is poor in soluble carbohydrate content. The main group of carbohydrates are insoluble celluloses (up to 15.9% fibre content) and only small amounts of starch and sugars (

). Among angiosperm species, pollen grain diameter ranges from less than 10 μm (e.g., in forget-me-not, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Myosotis
</tp:taxon-name>
) to over 100 μm (in some species like cotton or cucumber) (

). They are categorised as very small (&lt;10 μm), small (10−25 μm), medium (25−50 μm), large (50−100 μm), very large (100−200 μm), or giant (&gt;200 μm) (

). So, considering the maximum effective gape of the three species herein they could only grasp small to medium grains like those of the common sunflower (
<tp:taxon-name>
Helianthus annuus
</tp:taxon-name>
) found in 
UK
gardens (and thus in beehives), coriander, dill, and wild roses for instance (but not 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hibiscus
</tp:taxon-name>
pollen, nor pollen from wheat (

)). Ragweed pollen at 17−23 μm could only be grabbed by 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. lactis
</tp:taxon-name>
at best. Pollen grains of lucerne, various clovers and ornamental trees such as the Judas tree or the Black locust tree could be almost grasped by the chela of all three mites. However,
</p>
         <p>
hair 80; grain of salt 60−100; 
<tp:taxon-name>
Paramecium
</tp:taxon-name>
50−330; carrot cells 40−75; red blood cells/human dan- der/fine floor dust 40; white blood cells 20; plant &amp; animal cells 10−100; talcum powder/heavy dust
</p>
         <p>10; wood smoke 3; clouds, fog, sea spray and mineral dust 1−100; light dust/animal dander 1−5. The limit of visibility of particles visible to the naked eye is around 25−40 μm. Note that the moveable</p>
         <p>
digit mastication surface (′drape distance′) 
m
will be greater as it allows for surface asperities and gullets.
</p>
         <p>for most plant species, most individual pollen grains are actually small to medium (ca. 20–40</p>
         <p>μm) in size which then precludes the tyrophagid and glycyphagid herein from grasping them</p>
         <p>whole. Perhaps these taxa scrape off the oily ‘pollenkitt’ with its high content of fats and fatty</p>
         <p>
acids (

) that cover the pollen grains instead when in the hive.
</p>
         <p>
Even though the elongate digit of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. lactis
</tp:taxon-name>
is suitable for pollenophagy, note that even 
<tp:taxon-name>
C.
</tp:taxon-name>

         <p>
lactis
does not have the cheliceral tip design of an old fashioned ‘stab can-opener’ like in some
</p>
         <p>
pollenophagous phytoseiids (

). In those mesostigmatids the fixed digit may
</p>
         <p>hold the pollen down against the substrate and the moveable digit repeatedly slices into it by</p>
         <p>leverage. As among angiosperm species, pollen grain volume ranges over almost five orders of</p>
         <p>
magnitude (

) and common pollens like from Mary thistle, caper spurge, white
</p>
         <p>flax, blue flax, safflower, sesame, oil pumpkin and oil gourd are too large to be grasped, if</p>
         <p>astigmatids repeatedly bite into and demolish these larger pollen grains this needs examining</p>
         <p>as to how in a SEM follow-up study.</p>
         <p>Note that the distance along the L2M axis encompassing the three small posterior teeth in</p>
         <p>

C. lactis

</p>
         <p>
are normally around 1 μm in size (

)) and of the order of the diameter of the

         <p>
smaller fungal hyphae (at 1–3 μm (

), or 2–5 μm (

</p>
         <p>1983)). Yeast cells (present in beehives and tree exudates) vary enormously in size. However,</p>
         <p>although the largest yeast can be as big as 40 μm, the size of an average yeast cell is between 3</p>
         <p>and 12 μm depending upon species, so could be grasped (cracked and sheared) by the chela of</p>
         <p>
all three of the species herein.

(T13) sclerotisation of the condyle and moveable digit scored 1 and 1, respectively. The depth of the moveable digit matches the inferred resistive forces applied by the mite to food at that point. Condylar and moveable digit strengthening by sclerotisation is associated with eating tougher food (as indicated by the F2 values).

         <p>
Size of the mastication surface

         <p>
The largest and smallest size of the mastication surface with which the moveable digit can rest upon any material and generate friction are respectively, 21.3 μm (

Maximum food fragment size grabbed by the chela is shown in

</p>
         <p>in this species. On the face of it, only one maximum-gape grab of food material might yield</p>
         <p>
the equivalent of a single gastric bolus in this so-called ‘picking’ species.

<tp:taxon-name>
T. putrescentiae
</tp:taxon-name>
must comprise more than one
</p>
         <p>cheliceral grab as it is much wider than the length of the mastication surface (at 17 μm). Its</p>
         <p>volume would be equivalent to at best one grabbing bite suggesting this mite is more of a</p>
         <p>grazer or shredder than a collecting picker. Note that the hole excavated by one ‘bite’ of the</p>
         <p>two chelicerae will be only somewhat larger than that for one chela due to the partial overlap of</p>
         <p>
their calculated volumes (unless the mite moves its gnathosoma laterally between bites). 

</p>
         <p>

</p>
         <p>
(thus 627,995–701,398 μm

volume). This would also infer that many bites are needed to
</p>
         <p>
produce this suggesting it is a grazer. Using a variety of approximations, 

</p>

<tp:taxon-name>
T. putrescentiae
</tp:taxon-name>
is known to be a burrowing geophage constructing
</p>
         <p>
pores and aerating the substrate (

classifies it
</p>
         <p>
(T13 ‘A’) along with 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. lactis

(Ca4) as an ‘Interstitial’. Potential cavity-living, substratum browsing / gleaning ‘generalist’ species. On the other hand 
<tp:taxon-name>
G. domesticus
</tp:taxon-name>
(G5) was classified an ‘Interstitial’. Potential cavity-living, possible crevice feeding / excavating ‘specialist’. If these three species solely used their chelicerae to dig into food material with each chelicera grabbing and tearing off a chunk every second (that was then moved away backwards out
</p>
         <p>
of the way immediately by their pedipalps / legs) then a hole equivalent to their estimated body volume could be excavated by a single mite in around an hour or so (
Table 1
). This is reasonable to believe might happen and could be critically examined by timed observations of individual mites in a follow-up experiment. Noticeably small mites (i.e., subject to higher environmental temperatures (

)) in theory could excavate a body-size equivalent hole even more quickly as volume is a cube relationship to length. This time could be shorter

Morsel size pre-ingestion
</p>
         <p>
The thickness values (
thick
) are so small that the opportunity for wide transversal ridges on digit teeth that could act as ‘crush-blades’ of hard fibrous material like the molars of vertebrate ungulates (

) is limited except at the nano-scale. This could be looked for in a follow-up SEM study. Note that the thickness at the condyle closely approximates the size of the input lever moment arm (L1U, 
Table 1
) suggesting perhaps a growth process that is similar dorsoventrally as well as laterally during chelal evolution.
</p>
         <p>
Morsel size pre-ingestion 𝑇 𝑀𝑣

figures per specimen are shown in 
Table 1
. These morsel volumes could be compared to the typical fragment sizes found within the gastric boli of astigmatids as a validation in follow-up work. The lower limit of the measured gastric bolus volumes listed above at 1,121 μm 
3
(assuming that they are spherical) exceeds the size of: human sperm cells (30 μm 
3
), red blood cells (100 μm 
3
), lymphocytes (130 μm 
3
), neutrophils (300 μm 
3
) and beta cells (1,000 μm 
3
). The range of measured gastric bolus volumes (up
</p>
         <p>
to 701,398 μm 
3
) encompasses all other human individual cell volumes including fat cells
</p>
         <p>
at 600,000 μm 
3
. Only, human oocytes at 4,000,000 μm 
3
are bigger. The bolus volumes are generally much larger than the truncated food fragment volumes calculated herein, thus needing multiple chelal grabs to form (given the wastage of material from trimming). However, some other sort of oral trituration process of grabbed food material must also be happening after
</p>
         <p>
the chelae engage and crush the food as many mite anatomists illustrate a tiny trans-neural mass oesophagus in acarines (of the order of 10–15 μm diameter, e.g., 

, 

through which food must pass. This lumen width is only a little less than the average mastication surface length for the three species (see 
Table 1
) so, perhaps, one chelal ‘grab-length’ of material might be directly ingested once the distal parts of torn-off morsel were further trimmed laterally and dorsoventrally.

</p>
         <p>
μm in diameter i.e., around &lt;5 μm

in

volume), so some sort of ‘post-grab’ processing must occur. These very tiny elements are at the scale of bacterial cells when accompanied by slime capsules (

). The ‘end-on’ SEM of the gnathosoma of the water-filled tree-hole living 
<tp:taxon-name>
Naiadacarus arboricola
</tp:taxon-name>
(i.e., Figure 4B in 

suggests that
</p>
         <p>
distally the digits themselves on their own are only about half the width of their size at the condyle. Considering this as the effective ‘trim width’ would only reduce the estimates of the truncated food fragment size in by half (and thus divide the𝑇 𝑀 
𝐺
volume by eight in 
Table 1
) if it was used above (rather than taking the digit width at the condyle). This is still insufficient to reduce the food sizes down enough for the smallest fragment sizes to be consilient with 

’s photographs. i.e., even if the minimum gap between the rutella as the tips of the chelicerae digits passes between them is the important operating parameter. Further thought
</p>
         <p>on a pre-ingestion trituration process of grabbed and trimmed food material (perhaps by a labrum) together with some gastric bolus forming assembly mechanism is needed. Griffiths (pers. comm.) maintained that material could be seen not just to be squeezed within the gut of astigmatids but also whirled around.</p>
