ABSTRACT
</title>
         <p>
The
goal of this study was to estimate the biometric relationships and sex ratio for the red-spotted shrimp 
<tp:taxon-name>
Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis
(Latreille, 1817)
</tp:taxon-name>
from the coast of 
Sergipe
, northeastern 
Brazil
. A total of 
132 specimens
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. brasiliensis
</tp:taxon-name>
were collected and analyzed (
65 females
and 
67 males
) from 

May 2015

to 

May 2016

. 
The
overall sex ratio did not differ significantly from 1:1. 
Female
size ranged from 
20.73–46.43 mm
of carapace length (CL), whereas male size ranged from 
20.75–32.47 mm
CL. 
Females
were larger (34.78± 
6.05 mm
CL, 152.61± 
19.68 mm
of total length (TL)) and heavier (27.45± 
11.12 g
of wet weight (WW)) than males (27.07± 
2.56 mm
CL, 123.77± 
11.37 mm
TL and 14.48± 
3.98 g
WW). 
All
biometric relationships were different between females and males. 
Both TL
vs
CL and WW 
vs
TL relationships indicated positive allometric growth. 
Data
shown here correspond to an adult population exploited by local shrimp fleets and are an important contribution to the biological knowledge of this species, especially in northeastern 
Brazil
, where there is no information available

INTRODUCTION
</title>
         <p>

Marine shrimps of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Farfantepenaeus
Burukovsky, 1997
</tp:taxon-name>
are one of the most exploited fishing resources along the Brazilian coast due to their high market value (

; 

). Despite this commercial importance, all species belonging to this genus are commonly known as “camarões-rosa” (= pink shrimps) along the Brazilian coast (

; 

). However, the exploitation rate of each species is variable along the coast due to their different latitudinal distributions.For example, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Farfantepenaeus subtilis
(Pérez-Farfante, 1967)
</tp:taxon-name>
can be found from the Caribbean Sea (
20°N
) to Cabo Frio (
Rio de Janeiro
, southeastern 
Brazil
, 
23°S
), whereas 
<tp:taxon-name>
Farfantepenaeus paulensis
(Pérez-Farfante, 1967)
</tp:taxon-name>
occurs from Ilhéus (
Bahia
, northeastern 
Brazil
, 
14°S
) to 
Mar del Plata
(
Argentina
, 
38°S
) (

; 

). On the other hand, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis
(Latreille, 1817)
</tp:taxon-name>
shows a wider distribution than the two previously mentioned species, occurring from North Carolina (USA, 
35°N
) to 
Rio Grande do Sul
(southern 
Brazil
, 
33°S
) (

; 

)

.
</p>
         <p>
The
total catch of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Farfantepenaeus
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Brazil
was about 10.3 thousand tonnes in 2011, the last year for which catch statistics were available at a national level (

). 
This
amount was surpassed only by the 
Atlantic
seabob shrimp, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Xiphopenaeus kroyeri
(Heller, 1862)
</tp:taxon-name>
, with total catches of 15.4 thousand tonnes (

). 
The
total catch of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Farfantepenaeus
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
on the coast of 
Sergipe
(
11°S
) was about 
176.6 tonnes
in 2014 (

). However, it should be noted that in both national and local reports, there was no discrimination of catch by species, making it difficult to assess the exploitation status of each stock (

; 

; 

)

.
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis
</tp:taxon-name>
can be found from shallow water to 
366 m
of depth, inhabiting detritusrich muddy to gravel-sandy bottoms, and reach a size at first maturity at about 
150 mm
of total length (

). This species has a 
type
II life cycle, in which reproduction and egg release take place offshore and the post-larvae migrate to estuarine areas where they grow up to juvenile/subadult stages and then move back offshore to complete their life cycles (

). Therefore, 
<tp:taxon-name>
F.brasiliensis
</tp:taxon-name>
fishery may target two population groups: juveniles/subadults in estuaries and inshore habitats and/or adults offshore (

).
</p>
         <p>
Several population studies have estimated biometric relationships for penaeids and these relationships have been highlighted as an important tool for assessing the status of shrimp stocks, as very often different morphological traits may ref lect environmental inf luences or overfishing impacts (

; Dumond and D’Incao, 2010; 

; 

, 

; 

). Biometric relationships for 
<tp:taxon-name>
F.brasiliensis
</tp:taxon-name>
have already been estimated for southern and southeastern 
Brazil
(

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

) as well as for the Gulf of Mexico (

; 

; 

). Nevertheless, there is no information about this species for northeastern 
Brazil
. Here, 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. brasiliensis
</tp:taxon-name>
from the coast of the 
Sergipe
was studied to understand the biometric relationships and sex ratio of this species. Additionally, data from the present study were compared with those obtained from other populations to assess the variation of the traits studied along its distribution range.

MATERIAL
AND
METHODS
</title>
         <p>

Samples of 
3 kg
each were collected monthly from each category separated manually by fishermen onboard, based on shrimp size (‘espigão’ – small size, ‘escolha’ – medium size, and ‘pistola’ – large size), before landing in the 
Port of Aracaju
, state of 
Sergipe
, from 

May 2015

to 

May 2016

. 
No
sample was collected during the closed seasons, which correspond to 
April
1st to 
May
15th and 
December
1st to 
January
15th (

). 
Artisanal
shrimp trawlers along the coast of 
Sergipe
are 

8–13 m

long and operate with double nets with a mesh size of 
21 mm
in the cod end (
Fig. 1
). 
It
was not possible to collect information on local depth for each sample collected, as they were obtained from fishing boats at the port, right before landing. 
Each
sample was taken to the 
Laboratório de Ecologia Pesqueira
(LEP) of the 

Departamento de Engenharia de Pesca

e 
Aquicultura
(
Depaq
) at the 
Universidade Federal
de 
Sergipe
(UFS) and kept frozen until processing. 
Within
each category, each specimen was identified according to 

and 

, and all 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. brasiliensis
</tp:taxon-name>
present in all samples were separated

.
</p>
         <p>
Each specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. brasiliensis
</tp:taxon-name>
had its total length (distance from the tip of the rostrum to the tip of the telson, TL, mm), rostrum length (distance from the tip of the rostrum to the postorbital margin, RL, mm), and carapace length (distance from the postorbital margin to the mid-dorsal posterior edge of the carapace, CL, mm) measured with a digital caliper (precision: 
0.01 mm
) and was weighed (wet weight; W W, g) with a scale (precision of 
0.0001 g
). All individuals were sexed by checking the thelycum in females and the petasma in males. The maturation stage of the gonads was classified according to 

. Females were defined as immature (I), developing (II), mature (III) and spent (IV), and males as immature (non-linked petasma) and mature (linked petasma).
</p>
         <p>
A chi-square test (Χ²) with the Yates correction (

) was applied to test if the sex ratio differed statistically from 1:1. The mean length and wet weight of females and males were compared using t-tests with different variances (

). The relationships TL 
vs
CL, TL 
vs
RL and RL 
vs
CL were fitted using linear equations (Y=a+bX), while a power equation was fitted to both WW 
vs
TL and W W 
vs
CL relationships (Y=a∙ 
Xb
; 

). All relationships were estimated for females and males, separately, and then compared using an analysis of covariance (

). The hypothesis of isometry was tested for the length-length relationships (b=1) and weight-length relationships (b=3) using t-tests (

; 

). All statistical tests were performed with a significance level of 5%.

RESULTS
</title>
         <p>
In all samples collected from 
May 2015
to 
May 2016
, there were only 
132 specimens
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. brasiliensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and all of them were analyzed here (
65 females
and 
67 males
).The overall sex ratio did not differ significantly from the expected 1:1 (Χ²=0.007, 
p
=0.93).
</p>
         <p>
Regarding the maturation stage, all males were mature while most female individuals (48%) were in development. Mature and spent females were respectively 35% and 15% and only one individual (
21.09 mm
CL) was immature.
</p>
         <p>
Female size ranged from 
20.73 to 46.43 mm
CL, whereas male size ranged from 
20.75 to 32.47 mm
CL (
Fig. 2
). Females were larger and heavier (34.78± 
6.05 mm
CL, 152.61± 
19.68 mm
TL, and 27.45± 
11.12 g
WW) than males (27.07± 
2.56 mm
CL, 123.77± 
11.37 mm
TL, and 14.48± 
3.98 g
WW) (
Tab.1
). The TL/CL ratio was significantly lower for females than males (
Tab. 1
).
</p>
         <p>
All morphometric relationships were significantly different between females and males (
Tab. 2
). Both TL 
vs
CL and TL 
vs
RL indicated a pattern of positive allometry, while the RL 
vs
CL relationship indicated negative allometry (
Tab.2
). On the other hand, W W 
vs
TL relationship indicated a positive allometry pattern and W W 
vs
CL relationship showed negative allometry (
Tab. 2
).

(22% of total) caught were lower than 
25 mm
CL, however only 
one female
individual was immature. In this way, our data corresponds to an adult population, which is exploited by the shrimp fleet along the coast of 
Sergipe

.
</p>
         <p>
The
largest specimens observed on the coast of 
Sergipe
(
11°S
) (189.18 and 
145.90 mm
TL for females and males, respectively) were smaller than those recorded in southeastern 
Brazil
(
23°S
). 

recorded maximum sizes of 210 and 
180 mm
TL for females and males, respectively, while 

found values of 260 and 
219 mm
TL (both studies in coastal waters off the state of 
São Paulo
). Larger values (266 and 
219mm
TL for females and males, respectively) were also recorded off 
Mexico
(
21°N
) (

). All three studies also analyzed data from shrimp fisheries landings. These variations in body size can be influenced by habitat conditions (
e.g.
, water temperature and food/ nutrient supply) correlated with latitude (

), where an increase in body size is commonly observed with increasing latitude (

), in this case in both hemispheres

.
</p>
         <p>
The sex ratio of 1:1observed here is very common in penaeids (

), especially for populations occupying relatively constant environments (

). Likewise, sexual dimorphism is a very common trait in penaeids, with females being larger than males, which has also been observed for 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. brasiliensis
</tp:taxon-name>
in our study, and also by 

, 

, 

, 

, 

, and 

. This dimorphism ref lects a reproductive strategy, as larger size for females allows for larger gonads and higher fertility and, thus, maximizes egg production (

). As most organs of shrimps, including the reproductive ones, are located in the carapace, differences between sexes in the TL/CL ratio are expected, with females having a proportionally larger carapace than males as an adaptation to maximize egg production. Indeed, these differences in the TL/CL ratio are not observed when analyzing juveniles (

).
</p>
         <p>
Morphometric relationships vary according to the length/age, with younger, smaller individuals having higher slopes than older, larger individuals requiring different equations for conversions (

; 

; 

). Most of the morphometric data available for 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. brasiliensis
</tp:taxon-name>
are from juveniles/subadults inhabiting coastal habitats such as estuaries and coastal lagoons (

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

), which differ from the equations for adults such as the ones obtained here in the coast of 
Sergipe
.
</p>
         <p>
All length-length relationships estimated here, except for RL 
vs
CL, showed positive allometry corroborating previous records for this shrimp species in southeastern-southern 
Brazil
(

; 

). The same pattern has also been reported for other penaeids (

; 

; 

; 

) suggesting that positive allometry for TL 
vs
CL relationship is a common trait for these shrimps. Regarding the RL 
vs
CL relationship, 

also reported a negative allometry for juveniles of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. brasiliensis
</tp:taxon-name>
off 
Mexico
. However, studies carried out with 
<tp:taxon-name>
X. kroyeri
</tp:taxon-name>
indicated differences in the RL 
vs
CL relationship between juveniles and adults, with faster increase (positive allometry) being observed in juveniles (

). Faster increase of the rostrum length during the juvenile stage could be a strategy of this species to avoid predation, as observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>
X. kroyeri
(

Moraes 
et al.
, 2018

)
</tp:taxon-name>
         </p>
         <p>
The weight-length relationships showed contrasting patterns. When the W W 
vs
TL relationship was estimated, the allometry was positive for both sexes indicating a higher increase in weight than expected by the increase in total length. 

recorded a positive allometry for adult males and negative for adult females caught along the southeastern Brazilian coast. Later, an inverse pattern was recorded for the same region (

; 

). According to 

, the positive allometric growth presented by females is associated with the gain in weight due to gonad development. For the Mexican coast, this relationship was negative for both sexes (

). When the W W 
vs
CL relationship was estimated, the allometry was negative.
</p>
         <p>
It is expected that species with wide distribution ranges and complex life cycles (estuary-open sea migrations), such as 

<tp:taxon-name>F.brasiliensis</tp:taxon-name>
,

experience different environmental conditions that will be reflected in different biological traits such as body size and allometric growth. Differences may also result from differential fishing effort (

).However, it is very difficult to assess the exploitation status of the stock off 
Sergipe
due to data scarcity.
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis
</tp:taxon-name>

is overexploited or threatened with overexploitation along the 
Brazilian
coast and a sustainable management plan should be implemented (

). 
One
of the tools suggested was the establishment of closed seasons, which could vary among regions. 
The
closed season defined for 
Sergipe
according to 
<tp:taxon-name>Executive</tp:taxon-name>
Order N.

14, which was published on 

October 14th/2004

(

) by the 
Brazilian Ministry of Environment
, is from 
April
1st to 
May
15th and from 
December
1st to 
January
15th, but this measurement is for all shrimps caught in the region. 
More
recently, 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. brasiliensis
</tp:taxon-name>
was classified under the category “insufficient data” in a recent evaluation process conducted by the 
Chico Mendes Institute
for 
Biodiversity Conservation
(ICMBio) (

). 
Thus
, our results contribute to better knowledge on some biological traits of the red-spotted shrimp 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. brasiliensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, especially for northeastern 
Brazil
where there was no previous data
