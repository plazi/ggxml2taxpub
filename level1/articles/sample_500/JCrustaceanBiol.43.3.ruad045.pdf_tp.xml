The fishery of the western rock lobster, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Panulirus cygnus
George, 1962
</tp:taxon-name>
, is Australia’s most valuable wild-caught single-species fishery.Recruitment in some regions of the fishery was observed to be significantly lower than expected after the 2010/2011 West Australian marine heatwave that caused extensive disturbance of dominant coastal habitats. This event generated interest in the study of the factors influencing survival and recruitment of post-larval benthic 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
after settlement. The habitat associations of the highly cryptic post-settlement early-juveniles were previously unknown, with only anecdotal observations of individuals within limestone crevices in nearshore habitats. Our study used early-juveniles derived from ongoing monitoring of puerulus settlement to examine their habitat association mechanism in mesocosm experiments. Comparison of common nearshore habitat assemblages (bare sand, limestone crevices, and seagrasses (
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
) at varying seagrass densities) found that most early-juveniles associated strongly with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages at high stem densities (~2,100 stems m 
–2
). A shift in association between 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
fronds and stems at high stem density to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
-shaded sand and leaf debris at low stem density indicated active habitat selection by early-juveniles. Habitat choices were tested with the scents of prey items and habitat 
types
within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages using Y-maze bioassays. No significant olfactory choices were found, suggesting that habitat associations may be driven by multiple cues. Our study provides new laboratory-based insights into the habitat association of early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
and suggests changes in seagrass assemblage identity and density are likely to be important. Further experimentation is needed to define the cues driving these patterns. The impact of habitat change on recruitment in this important fishery remains unknown and should be an objective of future research.

INTRODUCTION
</title>
         <p>
Many marine organisms with separate juvenile and adult life stages often rely on refugia in their early life stages, presumably to avoid predators and to find food (

; 

). Identifying the nature, qualities, and availability of refugia habitats for benthic juveniles is crucial as it may explain the processes that underpin the structures of adult populations (

; 

). With marine ecosystems experiencing rapid changes in nearshore habitats due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts (

; 

; 

), understanding the impact of change in such habitats on the recruitment of commercially important species is important to inform fisheries science and subsequent management.
</p>
         <p>
The western rock lobster (
<tp:taxon-name>
Panulirus cygnus
George, 1962
</tp:taxon-name>
) is distributed along the mid-lower west coast of 
Western Australia
(WA), supporting Australia’s largest single-species, wild-capture commercial fishery worth over AUD$400 million annually (

; de 

). The lobster has an extended pelagic larval phase of 
9 to 11 m
, during which the larvae disperse over 
1,500 km
offshore (

). As larvae are carried shoreward by ocean currents, they metamorphose into a nektonic puerulus stage that more closely resembles the adult form (

). Using a combination of vertical migration and active swimming, pueruli actively migrate towards the coast where the majority are thought to settle in nearshore habitats (

; 

). Puerulus settlement has been sampled using artificial seagrass collectors at eight locations along the WA coast since the 1960s (

; de 

). This settlement index has been the basis of the management of the western rock lobster fishery over the last 30+ yr (de 

). The index has historically been a reliable predictor of sub-legal catches 2 to 3 y later and recruitment to the fishery 3 to 4 y later, enabling fisheries managers to adapt management accordingly by anticipating years of high or low catch per unit effort (de 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
After settlement, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
moult into a benthic post-puerulus form (0+ yr post-settlement, 
10–20 mm
carapace length (CL)), also known as an early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
(

Bellchambers 
et al.
, 2012

)
</tp:taxon-name>
. This life stage is highly cryptic in the wild. Little is therefore known about its ecology, an issue common in palinurid (family 
<tp:taxon-name>Palinuridae</tp:taxon-name>
) and homarid (family 
<tp:taxon-name>Nephropidae</tp:taxon-name>
) lobsters (

). No methods or surveys have successfully monitored the abundance and distribution of post-settlement early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
with substantial numbers of individuals only appearing in fisheries meshed trap-based surveys as undersized 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
juveniles. The minimum size of lobsters typically caught in these meshed trap-based surveys is 
40 mm
CL, which is likely 1 to 2 y post settlement (

). Early-juveniles have been anecdotally observed, typically as solitary individuals and as small as 
7 mm
CL, in limestone crevices via intensive diver-based searches (

). Larger juveniles (0+ yr, 
10–20 mm
CL) have also been found by diver-based surveys to be gregarious and closely associated with seagrass and macroalgal assemblages (

; 

). Seagrass and macroalgal meadows are commonly distributed in shallow-nearshore habitats throughout the distribution of the fishery of the western rock lobster (

). These diver surveys, however, were highly intensive and found the abundance of lobsters to be highly variable (

). The fishery is considered to be one of the most well researched and managed fisheries in the world, yet there is still remarkably little knowledge about the recruitment ecology of early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
due to their highly cryptic behaviour.
</p>
         <p>
In the austral summer of 2010/2011, an extreme marine heatwave (MHW) affected&gt; 
2,000 km
of coastline in mid-western WA, with warming anomalies of 2–4 °C (

; 

). The MHW led to extensive changes in dominant shallow-nearshore habitats such as canopy-forming seagrass species 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis antarctica
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia australis
</tp:taxon-name>
(

; 

; 

) and macroalgae (

; 

). Extensive defoliation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
was observed immediately after the MHW in Shark Bay, WA, with little documentation of recovery several years after the impact (

; 

). While 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
meadows showed better immediate resilience to the 2010/2011 MHW compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
meadows (

; 

), low levels of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
seed production and recovery were also observed five years post-MHW (

). The central and northern part of the western rock lobster fishery in Kalbarri, WA experienced an extensive decrease in coverage and density of previously dominant seagrass meadows and an increase in turf-dominated habitats as a result of the heating event (

; 

). Two years after the MHW, the abundance of undersized 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
(~ 
68–75 mm
CL) in Kalbarri was observed to be well below predicted abundance based on the puerulus settlement index from 3 to 4 y ago (

). This disjunction between previous puerulus settlement indices and abundance of undersized lobsters was the strongest in nearshore shallow waters of Kalbarri, corresponding with where their habitats were suspected to be most impacted in the geographical centre of the 2010/2011 MHW event (

). The observed disjunction may be a result of increased mortality in early-juvenile lobsters after the MHW due to the loss of habitat and/or food assemblages. With extreme MHWs projected to occur more frequently and intensively in the future (

; 

), understanding suitable habitat requirements of early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
is important to inform fisheries science and to better understand the implications of potential habitat change.
</p>
         <p>
There remains limited knowledge on the suitable habitats of the cryptic yet crucial life stages of the early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
. There are only a handful of 
in-situ
anecdotal detections (

) and laboratory-based inferences of the possible natural habitats (

; 

), a case which parallels the early life stages of the European lobster 
<tp:taxon-name>
Homarus gammarus
(
Linnaeus, 1758
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, where there are no published observations of wild juveniles (

). Early-juveniles of the Caribbean spiny lobster 
<tp:taxon-name>
Panulirus argus
(
Latreille, 1804
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, however, have been observed to settle onto vegetated habitats such as dense beds of the red macroalgae 
<tp:taxon-name>
Laurencia
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
(

) and seagrass meadows (

). The success in finding the habitats of early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. argus
</tp:taxon-name>
has led to further investigations (

; 

), including understanding the relationship between recruitment and fishery stocks in the economically important fishery species (

).
</p>
         <p>
Existing laboratory-based research on early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
revealed their general habitat preferences for seagrass assemblages, where they were shown to actively select 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages using chemotaxis (

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
are dominant seagrass habitats that occupy a large portion of shallow coastal habitats along the southern and south-western coast of 
Australia
(

). These benthic habitats are also typical of the nearshore area that occurs over most of the distribution of the western rock lobster, where sub-adults have been found to be closely associated with (

; 

, b; 

). It is thus hypothesized that seagrass meadows are likely to be important habitats for the successful recruitment of the species.
</p>
         <p>
Both 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
are habitat-forming seagrasses that can form extensive meadows (

), which creates a highly complex canopy, likely providing early-juveniles with protection from predators and with food such as epifauna and epiphytes (

). A stronger preference by the early-juveniles of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
for complex 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages over the less complex 

<tp:taxon-name>Halophila</tp:taxon-name>
/Zostera

seagrass species had been described (

). It is noteworthy that there was only some evidence of early-juveniles choosing the scents of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
over 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages (

). Early-juveniles 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. argus
</tp:taxon-name>
reportedly use a combination of chemical, sound, and conspecific cues to navigate and select suitable microhabitats within the intricate branches of dense, erect red macroalgae (

; 

). It is therefore possible for early-juveniles of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
to prefer the scents of 
<tp:taxon-name>

We aimed to refine the knowledge gaps in the habitat associations, specifically for seagrass assemblages, and requirements of post-settlement early-juvenile 

<tp:taxon-name>P. cygnus</tp:taxon-name>
.

Our study built on the novel findings of a previous chemosensory study, which demonstrated early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
displaying a strong preference for the scents of 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>

assemblages (

). We used early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
(0+ yr, 
10–20 mm
CL) obtained from puerulus collectors to examine their habitat associations using physical structures of various habitats. We used controlled mesocosms to compare the degree of habitat association between dominant coastal habitats, such as bare sand, limestone crevices, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
seagrass assemblages of varying densities, which are present in the biogeographic centre of the 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
distribution. We hypothesized that early-juveniles demonstrate a stronger association with 1) seagrasses, especially for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages, and 2) seagrasses of higher stem density. We also used two-chambered Y-maze bioassays to investigate potential chemical signals within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages that may influence active habitat selection in early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>

. We compared choices between two chemical stimuli of fine-scale components of

assemblages and choices between habitat 
types
(

<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
fronds and rhizomes were cleaned of both epiphytes and epifauna, and common prey items such as the assemblages of epiphytes and epifauna. We hypothesised that early-juveniles would associate with the olfactory cue of 
<tp:taxon-name>

fronds more frequently, as they would be an indicator of the presence of a favourable habitat (

         <p>Collection and housing of early-juvenile lobsters</p>
         <p>
We collected early-juveniles of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
(0+ yr, 
10–20 mm
CL) monthly around the full moon along the Western Australian (WA) coastline from pre-established artificial puerulus collectors (

). A total of 230 individuals were collected from 
August 2019
to 
January 2020
. The early-juveniles were transported in an aerated transport canister to the Indian Ocean Marine Research Centre (IOMRC) laboratory in Watermans, WA within 24 hr of collection. The early-juveniles were kept communally in holding tanks due to insufficient aquaria space for individual housings, where they acclimated for 5–7 d before they were used in trials. Artificial habitat made from plastic meshes and green nylon scourer pads was provided as shelter in the tanks to control for any habitat bias during trials. Constant flows of filtered (100 µm) seawater at 125 l h 
–1
and ambient ocean-water temperatures (16.3–23.6 °C) and salinity (35.5–36.0‰) were maintained in the holding tanks for six months. The lighting in the aquaria room was on a normal daylight cycle following an astronomical clock under LED white and blue lights.

Collection and housing of seagrass assemblage Seagrass assemblages were sampled at two coastal sites representative of the biogeographic centre of the distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
(
Phillips, 1972
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. The sites were Seven Mile Beach (
29°11’S
, 
114°53’E
) and Cliff Head (
29°31’S
, 
114°59’E
) near Dongara, WA. The sites were dominated by benthic habitats typical of the nearshore area where settlement and recruitment are suspected to be greatest (see 

). Both sites faced west and were located 
30 km
apart. Meadows of the seagrass 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
dominate limestone reefs and are patchily distributed within 
400 m
of the shore at Seven Mile Beach, and on a few heavily dissected rock outcrops and limestone reefs at Cliff Head. The seafloor of Cliff Head is also extensively colonized by the seagrass

A seagrass assemblage sample is characterised by a dominant seagrass species and its associated macrofaunal assemblages. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis antarctica
</tp:taxon-name>
(hereinafter 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
) assemblage samples were collected at both sites with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia australis
</tp:taxon-name>
(hereinafter 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
) assemblages sampled at Cliff Head. These two seagrass assemblages have considerable differences in their physical structural complexity, their diversity and abundance of associated macrofaunal species (

). The seagrass assemblage samples were collected mostly during low tide at both sites. Assemblages were sampled by placing the open face of a 25 × 
15 cm
plastic container over the sandy substratum, cutting around the edges of the container to the bedrock with a shovel, and levering the core into the container with minimal disturbance to the rhizomes and sediments (see 

). Assemblage samples were placed into 70 l heavy-duty plastic tubs filled to the top with fresh seawater and placed under constant aeration. The seagrass assemblage samples were then transported back to the IOMRC laboratory, Watermans WA within 10 h of collection and housed in the same holding room as the early-juveniles. Assemblage samples were used in trials as soon as possible after collection to minimise any changes from being sampled and confined within mesocosms.
</p>
         <p>Mesocosm</p>
         <p>
We used mesocosms to observe the habitat associations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
early-juveniles. Trials were conducted in three 100 l glass aquaria (L 60 × W 48 × H 
45 cm
) with running (125 l h 
–1
) aerated, filtered seawater from Watermans Bay Beach. An air stone was placed into the centre of each aquarium. Water temperatures (21.4–24.2 °C) and salinity (35.7–36.0 ‰) of the glass aquaria reflected that of ambient seawater from when the trials occurred. The lighting system of the holding room was used during the trials. Beach sand provided a 
15–20 cm
layer of natural substratum for the habitat samples. Treatment combinations consisted of two habitat 
types
, each as a single block, with the combinations alternated between the three mesocosms to account for positional bias (
Fig. 1
). The early-juveniles were randomly transferred to one of three mesocosm tanks to reduce any effects associated with the aquaria. No food was provided during the trials. The position of each early-juveniles within the mesocosm was recorded and photographed after 24 h (see 

).
</p>
         <p>
Due to the limited number of individuals from the puerulus collectors, 160 early-juveniles were used across three treatment combinations of the mesocosm trials. We conducted visual assessments before the start of every trial to ensure only early-juveniles of similar size class (
10–20 mm
CL) with no obvious physical damage (i.e., no missing legs or antennae) were used. Within the same treatment combination, early-juveniles were used up to three times total with a rest period of at least 48 h before they were haphazardly selected for subsequent trials. Early-juveniles were moved to a different holding tank containing only used individuals after each trial, depending on how many times they had been used. Those that were used three times were held in separate tanks from those that were used once and two times, respectively. There was a rest period of at least 24 h for each glass tank between trials to account for a random effect of mesocosm tank identity.

The association of early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
with either 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages or no association to a given habitat 
types
was examined first. Habitat patches were created by burying the rhizomes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
samples under sediment within a 25 × 
15 cm
area each (
Fig. 1A
). At least 
10 cm
of sediment surrounded each seagrass-assemblage to segregate the two seagrass patches and the surrounding walls of the mesocosm. We conducted six replicate trials (
N
of early-juveniles = 15 each) from 
17–21 December 2019
(water temperature 21.4–21.9 °C). Ninety early-juveniles, 30 collected in 
November 2019
and 
60 in
December 2019
, were used in these experiments. Early-juveniles had not been used prior to this treatment combination. Those found within 
2 cm
of mesocosm walls (edge) were recorded as ‘no association’ with any given habitat 
types
due to potential influence of artificial structure (the wall). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages were then compared against bare sand and limestone crevices based on the stronger association with the seagrass-assemblage by early-juveniles (see results for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
trials). Limestone crevices and bare sand were used as alternate habitat choices because they are the other dominant habitats in the nearshore areas of Seven Mile Beach and Cliff Head (

). The limestone crevices used in the trials consisted of limestone rock piled together, forming holes to simulate crevices in limestone reefs. The densities of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stems in the trials were manipulated to examine the habitat associations of early-juveniles when the density of seagrasses changed. Each alternate-habitat choice trial was replicated six times (
N
= 10 each) with four treatment levels of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stem density. All four density levels were compared to limestone crevices and bare sand separately. Each trial started with a maximum test density of 80 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stems, which simulated dense 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
meadows at Seven Mile and Cliff Head. Rhizomes were buried within an area of 25 × 
15 cm
with a stock estimate of ~2,100 stems 
m−2
. Densities of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
were decreased three times by haphazardly cutting 20 stems, reducing approximately 500 stems 
m−2
each time. The lowest 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stem density tested was ~600 stems 
m−2
.
</p>
         <p>
In the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblage vs. bare sand trials, 
Amphibolis-
associated habitat was defined by one body length (~ 
2 cm
) of an early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
from the seagrass patch (
Fig. 1B
). If an early-juvenile was found on the edge of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
-associated habitats, its position would be recorded as bare sand. Early-juveniles found within the edge of the mesocosms were recorded as no association with habitat 
types
. The trials for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblage against bare sand were conducted from 
18–26 January 2020
(water temperature 21.7–23.6°C). We used 84 early-juveniles in these trials, with 78 collected in 
January 2020
and 
8 in
December 2019
. Only individuals collected in 
January 2020
were reused for a second time in these trials. The microhabitat occurrences of early-juveniles within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
habitats were also investigated under changing stem density. Initially, pooled together as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblage, the microhabitat positions were analysed as a supplement to the main comparison between the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages and bare sand. Choices for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
microhabitat 
types
were recorded using four categories: 1) sand edges of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
patch, 2) debris, 3) 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stems and 4) 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
fronds (Supplementary material

).
</p>
         <p>
In the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblage vs. limestone crevices trials, the two habitat patches were separated at the halfway point of the aquaria (
Fig. 1C, D
). Associations with the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblage were instead defined by the position of each early-juvenile within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
patch or seagrass 
-
associated habitat. The latter was defined by sandy boundaries around the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
patch that had some shelter provided by overhanging seagrass fronds and underlying debris. The areas of 
Amphibolis-
associated habitats between the two trial 
types
were defined differently due to varying lengths of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stems between the seagrass samples. Early-juveniles found on open sand were likely associated with limestone crevices as indicated by the halfway point. The trials were conducted 
10–20 March 2020
(water temperature 22.6–24.2 °C) with 120 early-juveniles of similar size class (
10–20 mm
CL). Sixty individuals collected in 
January 2020
, and 60 from 
November and December 2019
combined. All early-juveniles had been used twice. Those found within the edge of the mesocosms were recorded as no association with habitat 
types
.
</p>
         <p>
All statistical analyses were conducted in R (R 

). A goodness-of-fit chi-squared test was applied to assess the frequency of early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
observed between 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages, and no association, and a uniform distribution of early-juveniles across the three habitat 
types
(

         <p>
In the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stem density trials (
Fig. 1B, C
), generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) were fitted to test if 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stem density (2,100, 1,600, 1,100, and 600 stems 
m−2
, fixed) and alternate habitat (limestone crevices and bare sand, or no association; fixed) influenced the probabilities of early-juveniles occurring in alternate habitats. Mesocosm tanks were treated as a random factor in the models. GLMMs were fitted using the binomial family with a logistic link function using functions from the 
lme4
package (

).

The effect of 
<tp:taxon-name>

stem density (2,100, 1,600, 1,100. and 600 stems

) on the frequencies of early-juveniles associating with microhabitats (fronds, stems, debris, sand edges of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
patch, bare sand, and no association) was assessed using a chi-square test of independence. The 
P
-values were computed with Monte-Carlo simulations for 8,000 replicates (

). If the test was significant (
P
&lt;0.05), pair-wise chi-square comparisons were made with a Bonferroni correction.
</p>
         <p>Y-maze</p>
         <p>
We used Y-mazes to examine the choices of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
early-juveniles for the finer components of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
habitat assemblages. This bioassay was designed to test olfactory-mediated responses by removing visual and physical stimuli. The construction of six identical Y-mazes was adapted from the design by 

(
Fig. 2
). Trials were conducted from 
August to September 2019
with 70 early-juveniles collected in the same months. Water temperatures of the Y-maze trials reflected ambient ocean temperatures ranging 16.3–19.3 °C. Y-mazes were installed on a levelled, robust platform with an adequate supply of filtered seawater and proximity to the holding tanks. We fixed a flow-meter gauge in the seawater line to ensure uniform flow rates and velocities. The feed lines were connected to gravity-fed water flow systems that held stimulus-infused water containing the scent of each food/habitat 
type
used in the trials. Stimulus water was created by first placing samples of each stimulus in well-lit 150-l holding tubs of seawater. Water supply to the holding tubs were turned off 2 hr before the start of the trials to retain constant concentrations of each stimulus. The respective stimulus-infused water was transferred from the holding tanks to reservoirs that supply inflow into the Y-mazes prior to each trial. The reservoirs held each stimulus for no longer than 20 min. Two stimuli were compared for each trial, giving three potential outcomes which were stimulus A, stimulus B, or no response when the animal made no choice.
</p>
         <p>
We tested three treatment combinations between two chemical stimuli to examine the choices of early-juvenile for fine-scale components of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
-habitat assemblages. Based on 

, these combinations tested between common prey items, habitat structure, and habitat 
types
within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
. The first treatment combination examined choices between 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
fronds and rhizomes (120 replicates with 70 ‘fresh’ individuals, 50 used a second time). We used four 
Amphibolis-
assemblage samples to create the stimuli in this combination. The fronds stimulus consisted of all 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stems separated from the rhizomes by cuttings. The second treatment combination tested whether the chemical stimuli of epiphytic algae and epifauna, common prey items in their omnivorous diet (

), influenced the habitat selection of early-juveniles (36 trials with 20 individuals used for a second time and 16 for a third time). Epiphytic algae and associated epifauna used in this combination were collected from four 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
-assemblage samples. The third treatment combination tested between 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
with or without associated epiphytes (48 replicates with 48 individuals, all used for a third time). Four fresh 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblage samples were washed in a flow-through seawater system. The outflow ran through a 100 µm filter sock which removed all epifauna and any dislodged epiphytic material. The remaining epiphytes on 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stems were also scraped with gloved hands and collected into the filter. The 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
without epiphytes were used as a stimulus whereas unmanipulated 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
samples with additional dislodged epiphytes were used as the other.
</p>
         <p>
Different sample sizes between the treatment combinations were due to different numbers of suitable early-juveniles (
10– 20 mm
CL with no physical damage) available for trials at that time. Early-juveniles were rested for at least two weeks between the three treatment combinations. Within the same treatment comparison, individuals rested for a minimum of 24 h before they were randomly selected to be reused. Early-juveniles were held in different holding tanks, depending on how many times they have been used.
</p>
         <p>
All seawater lines, gravity-fed water tanks, and stimulus feedlines were flushed with fresh seawater before trials began to avoid mixing stale water with stimulus-infused water. Y-mazes were filled before inflow rates were reduced to 100 l h 
–1
. The flow was left to stabilise for 60 s to ensure laminar flow. Stimulus-feed lines with the desired scents were added to the corresponding mixing compartments with their position alternated every trial. This removed any positional bias and ensured choices were made based on chemical stimuli. A holding panel was placed before the mesh screen to remove physical distractions from early-juveniles.
</p>
         <p>
All trials were performed at 23 °C in darkness and observed under dim red light that is considered insensitive to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P.cygnus
(

Cummins 
et al.
, 1984

)
</tp:taxon-name>
. The movements of early-juveniles were recorded using GoPro Hero 3 cameras (GoPro, San Mateo, CA, 
USA
). Six replicate Y-maze trials ran simultaneously. A randomly selected early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
was left in a confined chamber made of 
90 mm
PVC coupling placed in the start compartment of the Y-maze at the start of each trial. Each early-juvenile was left in the PVC coupling to acclimatise for 5 min. The coupling was removed slowly to avoid startling the individual.This initiated the start of the trial. The maximum duration of a trial was 10 min. A choice for a stimulus was recorded when the individual passed the start of the partitioning wall into the respective choice compartments. If the individual moved out of the first choice compartment and into the other, the second choice was also recorded. If no choice was made in 10 min, “no response” was recorded. The early-juvenile was removed and placed in another holding tank. Water in the Y-maze was flushed out and replaced to eliminate any cues left from the previous trial.
</p>
         <p>
Time logs for every trial were created by analysing the recorded videos. This provided a step-by-step record of all movements in each trial with a timestamp. The total time an early-juvenile spent in each mixing compartment with the corresponding stimulus in each trial was pooled. Two-tailed, paired t-tests were conducted in R (R 

) to compare differences in time spent between two treatments by early-juveniles.

over

</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages where we investigated the impacts of changes in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
density on the habitat associations of early-juveniles within mesocosm experiments. We found strong effects of early-juveniles associated with the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages, suggesting that the characteristics of complete 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages within mesocosms provide a strong physical cue for habitat association of early-juveniles.
</p>
         <p>
The 2010/2011 marine heatwave (MHW) off WA led to the loss of extensive areas of previously dominant shallow-nearshore habitats, including seagrass and macroalgae, and an increase in turf dominated habitats across the centre and north of the fishery (

). The extensive loss of biotic habitat in the region corresponds with the geographical range of the disjunction seen in the puerulus settlement index and recruitment estimates (

). Our results support evidence that early-juveniles of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
are more associated with seagrass habitats, in particular dense 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages, which suggests that these are possibly critical habitats to the survival and successful recruitment of the species. The results offer a possible explanation for the reduced recruitment observed in shallow-water fisheries surveys after the MHW (

; de Lestang, unpublished data). This lower-than-expected recruitment was most reduced in near-shore shallow water areas in the northern half of the fishery, where habitats were suspected to be most impacted by the 2010/2011 MHW (

). The reduced recruitment occurred two years after the heatwave event (

), suggesting an indirect effect rather than direct mortality. With MHW of higher intensity predicted to occur more frequently, impacts on seagrass communities are expected to be greater. Early-juveniles in our mesocosm experiment showed stronger associations with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages over 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages, likely due to its higher structural complexity (

). The loss of dense 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
meadows during the MHW resulted in fragmentation of the canopy and reduction in structural complexity (

) which may have ecological consequences such as reduced recruitment due to loss of nursery habitat and increased predation risk. The magnitude of damage has also been shown to vary between seagrass species due to different resilience capacities. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
meadows showed higher resilience compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
meadows, which were more impacted by thermal stress after the 2010/2011 MHW event (

). A loss of preferred habitat could potentially increase mortality in post-settlement early-juvenile lobsters, likely causing reduced recruitment to the fishery. Similar indirect ecological consequences on recruitment have been observed in other invertebrate species to the same MHW event, with a reduction in brown tiger prawn 
<tp:taxon-name>
Penaeus esculentus

</tp:taxon-name>
recruitment in Exmouth Gulf (

The early-juveniles of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
are notoriously difficult to detect in the field. Despite numerous attempts, previous 
in situ
studies were unable to find adequate numbers of individuals to conduct robust observations of habitat associations (

; 

). Our study avoided these limitations by using post-settlement individuals (0+ yr) collected from ongoing monitoring of their post-larval puerulus settlement. Their habitat associations were observed within mesocosms containing contrasting habitats, typical of the nearshore shallow water areas in the northern half of the fishery where settlement and recruitment are suspected to be the greatest (

). The results are consistent with previous diver visual surveys of larger juveniles (1+ to 2+ yr, 
25–35 mm
CL) that found individuals forage at night amongst dense 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
beds, rather than other seagrass habitats (

; 

). 

also found that large juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
tended to choose holes in artificial limestone reefs overgrown by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
more than crevices in reefs with no cover. Early-juvenile lobsters are suspected to experience high levels of predation during settlement and before recruitment to the fishery (

). It is thus expected of early-juveniles to associate strongly with habitats that provide protection from predators. Field studies of predation found that newly settled individuals (
5–15 mm
CL) of the Caribbean spiny lobster 
<tp:taxon-name>
Panulirus argus
</tp:taxon-name>
avoided predation by seeking shelter amongst continuous stands of algae (

). The dense stems of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages most likely provide protection from predators. It is also likely that these upright stems and leaf clusters provide prey, either epiphytic algae or macroinvertebrates, for the early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
(

, b). Our study nonetheless presents a novel laboratory observation of habitat selection by early-juvenile spiny lobsters towards 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages, where a range of potential cues (e.g. visual, physical, chemical), could have influenced the behaviour of the early-juveniles and their habitat choice. Further studies will be needed to investigate which of these factors is the most influential on habitat choice.
</p>
         <p>
Although adult spiny lobsters are generally thought to be gregarious in nature (

; 

; de 

), previous observations have suggested that early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
(0+ yr, 
10–20 mm
CL) are asocial and only become gregarious as larger juveniles (&gt; 1+ yr,&gt; 
20 mm
CL; 

; 

). We found no evidence of aggregation or social behaviour. There is nevertheless evidence that the early-juveniles (0+ yr) can tolerate gregariousness to a certain degree when resources are limited, with severe aggression observed only when early-juveniles were in antennal contact with conspecifics while sharing shelter space (

). Early-juveniles of the spiny lobster 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. argus
</tp:taxon-name>
were found to be more attracted to the nursery algal habitat with conspecifics than to a habitat without (

). Juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. argus
</tp:taxon-name>
were also observed to undergo ontogenetic habitat shift from solitary algal dwelling to aggregation in crevices at a smaller size when food is scarce, predation risk is low, and when conspecifics are present (

). While this may suggest conspecific attraction, previous studies on lobster 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. argus
(
Zito-Livingston &amp; Childress, 2009
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Jasus edwardsii
(
Hutton, 1875
) (

Butler 
et al.
, 1999

)
</tp:taxon-name>
found that early-juveniles had no response to conspecific odour. Predation risk reportedly also decreases substantially when juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. argus
</tp:taxon-name>
settle in dense algae with distance between conspecifics (

). It is possible that early-juveniles actively prefer habitat 
types
with conspecifics in nature to increase survivorship and protection against predation (

). We present some of the first steps to understanding the habitat associations of early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and suggest future studies examine the relationship between proximity to conspecifics, and differences among individuals (

) to better understand the habitat associations of early-juvenile in the presence of conspecifics.
</p>
         <p>
Importantly,ourmesocosmstudyfoundthattheearly-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
displayed varied degrees of associations to microhabitat 
types
in response to changing densities of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stems. Microhabitat use by early-juveniles had been previously studied in various species of spiny lobsters (

; 

; 

). Our study provides novel observations of the impact of changing seagrass density on the habitat associations of early-juvenile spiny lobsters, providing new insights into the recruitment habitat of an important commercial species. It should be noted that the linear changes in association between habitats (e.g., debris to stems) with linearly increasing stem density could simply be the result of random allocation of individuals between habitats. The non-linear response, however, observed in the association of early-juveniles between 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stems vs. fronds, as the density of stems increases, suggests that other processes rather than random allocation are occurring and we observed behavioural preferences in habitat choice.
</p>
         <p>
Changes in coverage and stem density of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
beds were reported after the 2010/2011 MHW (

; Arias-Ortiz 
et al.
, 2018; van 

). Our results suggest active microhabitat association by early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P.cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Fronds and stems of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages at higher stem densities make up complex canopy structures (

), which provides shelter from predation and high diversity of trophic resources which are crucial in recruitment (

, b; 

; Heck &amp; Orth, 2006; 

). Although the current mesocosm study lacked predators, it is possible that innate predator avoidance behaviours (

; 

) may have driven the strong choices for complex canopy structures. In contrast, early-juveniles displayed stronger associations with sand shaded by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stems and leaf debris when 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stem density was low. A manipulative study had found that when 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stem densities were reduced by half, an increase in either mortality or emigration of species associated with more open spaces led to a decrease in the abundance of leaf-associated epifauna (

). With sparse stem density, more open spaces and reduced shelter complexity on the benthos may have led to early-juveniles avoiding 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
fronds and stems. They instead seek shelter amongst microhabitats at the sediment surface. Early-juveniles were observed to find refuge by camouflaging against leaf debris and by burrowing into sediment under the layer of debris. This is consistent with the observed behaviour of post-larval American lobster 
<tp:taxon-name>
Homarus americanus
H. 
Milne Edwards, 1837
</tp:taxon-name>
burrowing in mud (

) and of the European lobster 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. gammarus
</tp:taxon-name>
hiding under cobble shelters (

) when complex habitat is unavailable. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf debris has additionally been reported to have a distinctive epifaunal assemblage that resembles those of rhizomes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Posidonia
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
(
Edgar, 1990b
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. This observation suggests that there could be higher macrobenthic production as leaf debris accumulates, providing both a potential source of food and refuge from predators for early-juveniles.
</p>
         <p>
Early-juveniles in the mesocosm experiments were observed to shift their habitat associations from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages to limestone crevices as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stem density decreased. Previous studies highlighted that, at high density and when food resources are limited, post-moult juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
are highly vulnerable to cannibalism from larger conspecifics (

; 

). Larger juveniles (
30–45 mm
CL) have been found aggregating in crevices and under ledges on the same reefs as smaller, early-juveniles (
10–20 mm
CL; 

). It is thus possible that the early-juveniles are cautious to associate with limestone crevice habitats, where larger conspecifics may occur, as seagrass densities decrease.
</p>
         <p>
The densities of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stems (600–2,100 stem 
m−2
), representative of key sites in the nearshore coastal habitats across the northern half of the fishery, were used in our mesocosm study. The maximum stem density is, however, approximately double to that of typical reported values for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
densities (
1,000
–1,500
stem 
m−2
; 

). Our results should therefore be interpreted with caution, but nevertheless suggest that the very high 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
stem densities used, which are found at suspected key recruitment sites in the fishery, were demonstrated to be more frequently chosen by early-juveniles and could potentially be important for the survival of this vulnerable life stage.
</p>
         <p>
We found no evidence of early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
exhibiting particular choices for various chemical signals when presented with cues for habitat 
types
within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages or typical prey items in Y-maze bioassays. The early-juveniles have chemosensory receptors (

), with evidence demonstrating their chemosensory abilities and its importance in habitat selection (

). There is nevertheless little information on the exact properties of chemoreception and its role in active habitat selection of wild 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Early-juveniles of the Caribbean spiny lobster 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. argus
</tp:taxon-name>
have been shown to use algal architecture and food abundance as a cue for habitat selection (

), and early-juveniles of 
<tp:taxon-name>
J. edwardsii
</tp:taxon-name>
have the ability to detect and respond to habitat-specific acoustic and substrate cues (

). Early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
are omnivorous scavengers (

). General prey availability may thus be more important than the presence of single prey items in nursery habitats since these early-juveniles have a wide dietary spectrum (

). Future studies would be required to investigate the effects of fine-scale components within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages on choices of early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
for the seagrass assemblage.
</p>
         <p>
Obtaining early-juvenile lobsters from existing puerulus collectors is logistically complicated. Lower-than-expected number of early-juveniles were collected during our trials, which necessitated the re-use of individuals. We acknowledge that such re-use may have led to non-independence within our result, and strongly suggest that future studies attempt to collect adequate numbers of individuals for independent trials. We considered identifying individuals to account for non-independence but due to the very small size (
10–20 mm
CL) and initial mortality of individuals, it was decided to progress with limited re-use in the current study. We strongly suggest that future studies consider sampling method that enables adequate numbers of individuals to be collected in order to remove the need to re-use test animals.
</p>
         <p>
Although our studies on habitat association in the laboratory have provided insights into potential habitat selection mechanisms, direct detection of early-juveniles 
in situ
is required to confirm 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amphibolis
</tp:taxon-name>
assemblages as their habitat. The simple mesocosms also lacked predators and larger conspecifics which are likely to be present in natural environments. Future studies should incorporate predation pressure and density-dependent factors for early-juveniles and larger conspecifics in habitat-association experiments to better understand habitat selection by early-juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
in nature. Likewise, the impact of habitat change on the growth and survival of early-juvenile lobsters remains unknown and should be an objective for future research into the impacts of variation in seagrass coverage and density. This study nonetheless corroborate the hypothesis that seagrass habitat loss could be detrimental for 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. cygnus
</tp:taxon-name>
recruitment to the fishery. Our study suggests that in addition to existing monitoring of puerulus settlement on artificial seagrass collectors (de 

) and undersized lobster abundance, seagrass coverage and density could provide useful metrics to estimate both the impacts of future marine heatwaves and the potential of successful recruitment throughout the fishery.
