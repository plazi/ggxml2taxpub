Summary.
The belowground biota (nematodes, fungal biomass, roots and mycorrhizal development) of a mature Sitka spruce stand under the influence of acid precipitation (equimolar sulphuric acid and ammonium nitrate) was investigated. Sampling took place after 3 years of treatment and 5 months after the end of treatment. Acidification led to a decrease of the soil pH from 5.0 to 4.0 in the upper 2 cm of soil. The active fungal biomass, measured as the ergosterol content of the soil, increased. After the end of the acid treatment pH differences decreased between plots. The active fungal biomass was lower, but the amount of total fungal hyphae was higher at the acid treated plots. Additionally, precipitation of acid mist led to an acceleration of fine root and mycorrhizal development and their senescence.
</p>
         <p>
A total of 79 nematode species were found in the plots. Acidification caused a distinct decrease in species number, especially among 
K
-strategists like omnivores and predators. The population density was not altered, but the dominance and abundance structure of the community changed.

The proportion of fungal feeding nematodes increased under acid precipitation, but the effect did not last after the end of the treatment. This corresponds to the amount of the active fungal biomass measured in the soil, indicating that the composition of the nematode fauna is changing with the presence or absence of their food source.

Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Acid deposition is a major environmental concern in much of the industrial world. Acidic air pollutants may affect forest ecosystems through direct impacts on the aboveground parts of trees, as well as through indirect effects on soil chemistry, microbiology and tree roots. Their deposition leads to soil acidification, altered nutrient availability or increased solubility of toxic heavy metals (

; 

). Increased soluble Al concentration and the Al/Ca ratio in the soil solution may damage root systems (de 

). Alterations in mycorrhizal development may be also deleterious to tree growth, because of their important role in plant nutrition. Negative effects of artificial acidification have been observed on mycorrhizae for several tree species (

; 

; 

; 

). Acid precipitation also influences the type, abundance, and activities of microorganisms in soils by altering pH as well as concentrations of N and S oxyanions (

). 

and 

found the respiration rate and the composition of fungal communities to be affected by atmospheric sulphur dioxide. Soil microorganisms are a substantial part of the diet for many soil animals and changes in their numbers or activity may be accompanied by shifts in the soil fauna.
</p>
         <p>
Acid precipitation on forest floors has been shown to affect the community structure of the soil fauna (

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

). There is much evidence that the composition of the decomposer fauna is partly a function of soil acidity (

). Nematodes are the most abundant invertebrate group in soils. Most of them feed on bacteria and fungi, and their trophic structure may reflect changes in soil microorganisms resulting from pollution (

). Studies on their response to manipulation of pH in forset soils indicate that the nematode community is affected by both increased or decreased soil acidity (

; 

; de Goede &amp; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

). Some species appear to be sensitive to air pollutants and could possibly serve as bioindicators (

, 

).
</p>
         <p>
Detailed studies dedicated to acid deposition effects on belowground plant parts and associated soil microflora and fauna are scarce. The aim of the present study is to investigate the influence of artificial acidification on nematode community structure in a spruce forest soil. By assessing the amount of fungi and roots, as an important nematode diet, direct effects of acidification and indirect effects via food supply can be determined. As there is need for appropriate indicator species in an ecotoxicological context (

) the use of nematodes for the evaluation on pollution effects in soil ecosystems is studied in this paper.

Materials and Methods
</title>
         <p>
Site
</p>
         <p>
The experimental site is a 900 m2 plot of Sitka spruce (
<tp:taxon-name>
Picea sitchensis
(Bong.) Carr.
</tp:taxon-name>
) growing at Glencorse Mains field (55 °51 'N, 3 °13' W) within 2 km of the ITE Research station Bush near Edinburgh (Scotland). The site is located at an altitude of 200 m a.s.l., the mean annual precipitation is 1100 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 7.6 °C. The soil type is a clay loam, on Rawnhill associations-series, Winton, derived from carboniferous shales and sand stone. The soil has a content of % C LOI 10 and the humus form is moder. Previously the land was used in an arable crop rotation (barley). Prior to the planting of conifers, it was covered by mixed, fast-growing grasses.
</p>
         <p>
The trees are a single clone, 22 yr old, taken as cuttings from a parent tree in 1972. The cuttings were initially propagated in pots and were transferred to the field site in 1984 as a 12 x 12 block with 2.5 m spacing. For the acid treatment spray chambers were designed to enclose blocks of 4 trees. Each chamber comprised a framework of galvanised steel poles supporting fixed panels of glass-reinforced plastic sheeting and a set of polythene roller blinds. The latter were drawn down to make the chamber side walls, only for the duration of the acid mist application (approx. 20 min). The control trees were unchambered and didn’t receive any treatment. In 1992 a control experiment was set up to investigate chamber effects. The result of this test showed that the growth of sprayed chamber controls was identical to that of unsprayed, unchambered control trees (Crossley, pers. com.). Growth, frost hardiness and aboveground damage of the trees were recorded by the ITE Bush (for details see 

, 

). The experiment was carried out with 2 treatments (control, acid mist), and 3 replicate plots per treatment. The acid treatment at pH 2.5 was an equimolar mixture of H2 SO4 and NH4NO3 (1.6 mol m-3 SO4, NO 3, NH4 and 3.2 mol m-3 H +). Treatments began in July 1990 and stopped in November 1993. During the growth season of the trees (usually May to November) acid mist was applied 50 times each at 2 mm equivalent deposition (501 per chamber). Total inputs of S, N, and H + were 54.6, 47.8, and 3.4 kg ha- 1, respectively. This was apparently double the annual inputs in total precipitation of upland forest areas in southern Scotland of 25 —35 kg ha- 1 S and N, and 0.5 — 0.7 kg ha1 H + (

).
</p>
         <p>
Nematodes
</p>
         <p>
Nine replicate soil samples were taken with a soil corer (2.5 cm diameter) from each treatment plot and divided into 0 — 2, 2 — 4, and 4 — 6 cm depths. They were stored (max. 30 h) at 4 °C until extraction. Samples were taken twice, in October 1993 and April 1994. Nematodes were extracted from soil using a modified Baermann method (see 

). The soil was placed on a porous filter (cotton discs for manual milk filtration, 16 cm diameter) supported by a wire screen at the top of a funnel (9 cm diameter). The funnel was connected to a small glass vial (25 ml) and the whole system was filled with tap water. Nematodes were extracted for 24 h at room temperature (13 — 15 °C). Then a heating regime was started using electric bulbs placed over the extraction funnels. Temperature reached 42 °C after 4 h and samples were kept there for a total of 6 h. Nematodes were preserved in 4% formaldehyde solution (60 °C). The number of nematodes extracted from each sample was counted and 10% of the nematodes (but not less than 100) were identified. Altogether 42800 nematodes were counted and 10500 of them were determined to genus or species. The classification of trophic groups is according to 

.
</p>
         <p>
Fungi
</p>
         <p>
The amount of fungi in the soil was evaluated using 2 different techniques. One was the measurement ofhyphal length to assess the total mycelial concentration, and the other the estimation of the ergosterol content of the soil, which is related to the active biomass of fungi (

; 

). Simultaneously to nematode sampling 3 replicate soil cores (12 cm diameter) were taken in October 1993 and April 1994 from each treatment plot and divided into the layers 0 — 2, 2 — 4 and 4 — 6 cm. About half of the soil of each core was taken for measurement of soil pH (H2O) and water content (
Table 1
). The other half of each soil sample was homogenized for 10 s using an MSE Atomix homogenizer at half speed. Afterward homogenization, 3 subsamples of each 1 g (fresh weight) of soil were taken for ergosterol analysis. From the residual soil 10 g (fresh weight) were processed for membrane filtration (only in April 1994) and were homogenized for an additional 10 s in 100 ml distilled water. The suspension was made up to 11, thoroughly mixed, and 10 ml pipetted into 90 ml of water. Of this solution 1 ml was passed under vacuum through a 1.2 pm membrane filter (Millipore, 13 mm diameter) and washed with 15 ml of sterile water containing 3 drops of cotton blue (0.05%) as a stain. Six filters were made from each soil sample. Filters were removed and mounted on microscope slides in immersion oil as a ‘clearing ’ agent. Hyphal length was determined from the number of intersections with a grid system on an eyepiece graticule (

).
</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>One gram soil samples (9 replicates per treatment), to be analysed for ergosterol content, were suspended in 30 ml methanol and transferred to 250 ml round bottom flasks and refluxed for 2 h. Afterwards they were filtered to remove soil particles and saponified with 5 ml of KOH (3.2%) in ethanol by refluxing for 30 min. When cooled, 10 ml H2O were added and the solutions were extracted 3 times with pentane (10, 5 and 5 ml). The pentane extracts were evaporated to dryness overnight (30 °C). The residues were redissolved in 1 ml methanol prior to quantification using a reverse-phase HPLC system at a wavelength of 282 nm.</p>
         <p>
Roots
</p>
         <p>
Root growth was assessed by estimating the potential of root systems to extend into a uniform inert growth medium (

). In both treatment plots root ingrowth cores (12 replicates each) were established by removing soil cores of 10 cm diameter (16 cm deep) and back filling the hole with sand. To minimise disturbance effect of live roots during placement in the soil profiles, the root ingrowth cores were set out in spring (April 1993) when root growth is low (

). Root ingrowth cores were harvested in November 1993 by removing a central core (9 cm diameter, 13 to 16 cm deep) from the sand. A simultaneously sampling to nematode and fungal samples was not possible by using this method.
</p>
         <p>
Roots were separated from the sand by washing under a tap, over a sieve with mesh aperture 0.5 mm. Roots (cut into 50 mm length) and root fragments were randomly placed on a metal tray marked with grid lines. According to the generator of random numbers 5 grid squares were selected in different patterns. These representative root subsamples were immediately fixed in glutaraldehyde and divided into 2 categories, coarse roots (&gt; 1 mm diameter) and fine roots (&lt;1 mm diameter). The length of the fine roots was determined using the grid line intersect method of 

.
</p>
         <p>
The fine roots were evaluated under dissection microscope into 5 classes of root tip development and for 3 vitality degrees. The number of root tips for all classes were counted. The different classes of root tip development are 1 (root initiation), 2 (elongated root tip with root hairs), 3 (tip slightly swollen), 4 (tip considerably swollen or clubbed, first mycorrhizal structures) and 5 (fully developed mycorrhiza) (for details see 

). The vitality degrees of the root tips are turgid (young tip which is assumed to be absorptively functioning), shrivelled (older tip, live and functioning vascular tissues, but absorptively nonfunctioning) and dead (for details see 

).
</p>
         <p>
Statistics
</p>
         <p>For statistical analysis a standard nonparametric and robust method, the Mann-Whitney U test, was used. With this test a pairwise ranking of treatments was made for the data obtained (e.g. fungal biomass, root length, nematode population density). The test of each pair does not depend on the other treatments in the study. This robust method was chosen, because with the lack of a random block design for sampling, a spatial pseudo replication of data occurred.</p>
         <p>Additionally, linear regression analysis was carried out to investigate correlation between nematode community structure (e.g. trophic groups) and fungal biomass. Samples for root development were not taken into consideration, because they were not taken simultaneously with the other samples.</p>

Soil parameters
</p>
         <p>
Soil pH and water content of the investigated plots are given in 
Table 1
. After treatment with acid mist soil pH was clearly reduced. These effects were significant for all soil depths in October 1993. Changes were more obvious in the upper soil layer (0 — 2 cm), where the soil pH was 5.0 at the control and 4.0 at the acidified plots. Acid treatment stopped in November 1993, and differences in the pH decreased between plots. In April 1994 in 0 — 2 cm soil depth the pH was 4.9 at the control and 4.5 at the acidified plots. In deeper soil layers pH values were almost equal. Application of acid mist increased the soil water content in October 1993. No higher soil moisture was found in April 1994, after the end of the treatment.
</p>
         <p>
Fungi
</p>
         <p>Total mycelial mass (hyphal length) and active fungal hyphae (ergosterol) were used to assess the fungal biomass in the soil (Fig. 1). Total and viable biomass showed differing vertical distribution in the soil. The ergosterol content decreased strongly with depth. More than 90 % of the ergosterol was concentrated in 0 — 2 cm soil layer, but only 59 to 66 % of the total fungal mycelia were found here as determined by hyphal length counts.</p>
         <p>
In October 1993 more viable hyphae (ergosterol) were observed in 0 — 2 cm of the acidified plots compared to the control. In April 1994, 5 months after the last acid treatment, and an increase of the soil pH from 4.0 to 4.5 at the acidified plots (see 
Table 1
), more ergosterol was found in the control plots in all soil depths. These effects were significant (P &lt;0.05) in the 2 — 4 and 4 — 6 cm layers. Hyphal length (total) in April 1994 showed similar distribution pattern as for ergosterol in October 1993, but differences between treatments were not significant.
</p>
         <p>
Roots
</p>
         <p>
The ‘regeneration potential’ of fine roots was quantified by root ingrowth cores harvested in November 1993 after 7 months. The amount of fine roots grown into the sand cores was higher at the acid mist treated plots (5.2 + 5.3 mm/cm3) compared to the control plots (3.1 ± 2.8 mm/cm3). However, variations within replicate samples were high and differences between treatments not significant. The root tip density, with 3.3 ± 2.4 tips/cm at the control and 3.5 ± 2.8 tips/cm at the acidified plots, was similar. Acid mist precipitation seems to accelerate mycorrhizal development in roots (
Table 2
). The density of fully developed mycorrhizae (phase 5), as well as the occurrence of shrivelled (older) root tips was greater at the acid treated plots. No dead root tips were found in the ingrowth cores.
</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>
Nematodes
</p>
         <p>
A total of 79 different species were found at the plots, of which 18 could only be determined to genus (
Table 3
). Usually the occurrence of these 18 taxa was rare, making it difficult to assign them to described species. The classification into trophic groups was made according to 

. Overall numbers of species were distributed differently. The bacterial feeders were the most common group with 33 species, followed by plant feeders with 22 species. The latter group includes mainly ectoparasites or epidermal cell and root hair feeders, but some migratory endoparasites or semiendoparasites were also observed. Other feeding types found were 9 fungal hyphae feeding species, 7 omnivores and 7 predators. Only one species belonged to the group of unicellular eucaryote feeders, which feed on diatoms or algae, as well as ingesting fungal spores or yeast cells. Eudominant (&gt; 10%) on at least one sampling date and soil depth were the bacterial feeders 
<tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>

Acidification caused a decrease in the total number of species from 77 at the control plots to 62 at the acid mist plots (
Table 3
). These effects were most evident among the omnivores and predators, where numbers were reduced to about half. The dominance structure of the different species varied between treatments. The occurrence of many bacterial feeding species was reduced after acid mist precipitation. Others, like 
<tp:taxon-name>
M.
crassidens
</tp:taxon-name>
, were more dominant. In particular some frequent fungal and plant feeders showed different distribution patterns. The fungal feeding species 
<tp:taxon-name>
Deladenus
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Diphtherophora vanoyei
</tp:taxon-name>
made up to 5 % of the population at the control plots, but were not detected at the acid mist plots, where 
<tp:taxon-name>
Tylolaimophorus
typicus
</tp:taxon-name>
was more common. Among the plant feeders the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Filenchus
</tp:taxon-name>
was negatively affected by acid treatment, but 
<tp:taxon-name>
Paratylenchus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cephalenchus
</tp:taxon-name>
seemed to gain importance. Almost all omnivore and predatory species were less dominant after acidification. In 
Table 4
species numbers in the different soil layers of the plots are given. Between 39 and 54 nematodes species were observed. Species numbers were higher at the control plots at all sampling dates and depths.
</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>
The population density of the nematode fauna in 0 — 6 cm soil depth ranged between 232 and 392 Ind/g DW or 1.9 and 3.1 x 106 Ind/m2, respectively (
Table 5
). As for many soil animals, the horizontal distribution of the nematodes was aggregated. Great differences were observed between replicate soil cores; for example in October 1993 between 677 and 1883 individuals per core were found at the control plots. Overall, more than 83 % of all nematodes were observed in the upper soil layer. Numbers decreased strongly with soil depth, but differences between treatments were generally low.
</p>
         <p>
The proportion (%) of juveniles and males among the nematode population ranged between 65.4 to 82.4% and 0.8 to 3.3%, respectively (
Table 5
). Their frequency showed no distinct differences with depth. For both treatments high proportions of juveniles were correlated with low numbers of species observed in the samples (a = 0.05 in April 1994). At both sampling dates the occurrence of juveniles was slightly higher, and the occurrence of males slightly lower, in the acidified plots. These differences were significant (P &lt;0:001) only in 0 — 2 cm soil depth in April 1994 for the juvenile nematodes.

         <p>
Acidification also influenced the abundance of species (
Table 6
). Some taxa, like 
<tp:taxon-name>
A.

nanus, 

M. 
crassidens
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aphelenchoides
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
were more frequent at the acid mist plots, especially in the upper soil layer. After the end of the acid treatment the abundance of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M
. 
crassidens
</tp:taxon-name>
increased extremely to reach 87.6 Ind/g DW in 0 — 2 cm soil depth of the acid mist plots, compared to the control with 7.5 Ind/g DW. Other species were negatively affected by acid precipitation. The occurrence of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cervidellus serratus
</tp:taxon-name>
was lower at both sampling dates, while 
<tp:taxon-name>
Filenchus
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aporcelaimellus obtusicaudatus
</tp:taxon-name>
seemed to recover slowly in April 1994.
</p>
         <p>
Generally the bacterial feeders, which contributed 33 — 54% of the nematode fauna, were the most abundant trophic group (
Fig. 2
). Next in frequency were the fungal and the plant feeding nematodes with contributing of 13 — 36% and 10 — 39%, respectively. Omnivores, predators and unicellular eucaryote feeders made up only minor parts of the nematode fauna. The distribution of the trophic groups changed with the soil depth. Bacterial and fungal feeders were most frequent in the upper soil layer, while plant feeders gained importance with depth. Omnivores and predators occurred mainly in 2 — 6 cm, and unicellular eucaryote feeders in 2 — 4 cm soil depth.
</p>
         <p>
Effects of the acidification differed between groups (
Fig. 2
). Among the bacterial feeders no distinct changes could be observed. Plant feeders were more frequent in 0 — 2 cm soil depth of the control plots. In deeper soil layers their occurrence was quite similar in both treatments. Marked effects on fungal hyphae feeding nematodes were noticed in October 1993, when the acid treatment was still applied. They were more frequent in the acidified plots, especially in 0 — 2 cm depth, but differences were not significant. In April 1994 fungal feeders occurred in similar numbers at both treatment plots. Although these results fit well with the increase of the soil pH and the decrease in active fungal hyphae at the acid mist plots in April 1994, no correlations between fungal feeders, pH or ergosterol content of the soil could be observed.
</p>
         <p>The proportions of omnivores, predators and unicellular eucaryote feeders were reduced after acidification at all sampling dates and depths. This decrease was significant (P &lt;0.05) for the omnivore nematodes in 0 — 2 and 4 — 6 cm soil depth in October 1993 and in 0 — 2 cm soil depth in April 1994.</p>

Discussion
</title>
         <p>
Pollution stresses such as increased acid or N deposition affect forest soils. Typical acidifiers are the anthropogenic air pollutants SO 2 and NO X; their effects as mixed acidic solutions (H 2 SO4 and NH4NO3) were investigated in the present work. The soils were slightly acid (pH 5.0) and deposition of acid mist led to a decrease of the soil pH, especially in the upper soil layer (pH 4.0). Many soil chemical processes relate to soil solution pH, and acidification is likely to increase the leaching of Ca and Mg from the soil (

). In this critical range pH changes also influence the mobility of Al (

) and soil nutrient cycling (

; 

). The adsorption of SO4, NO 3 and PO4 by soils is dependent on solution pH, and a decline in pH from 5.0 to 4.0 might reduce the concentration of P in solution by 10-fold (

).
</p>
         <p>
All these alterations in soil chemistry are of great importance for tree nutrition and growth, as well as for soil microorganisms and fauna. Acid precipitation can decrease microbial biomass N and change microbial population assemblages even when no pH changes are evident (

; 

). Generally, fungi have lower pH-optima in soil than the majority of bacteria, and a decrease of soil pH leads to a shift towards fungal growth. This fits well with the observed active fungal biomass, measured as the ergosterol content of the soil, which was higher at the acidified plots in the upper soil layer. Ergosterol is the prominent sterol in most fungi, but only a minor component in bacteria or higher plants (

). It is rapidly degraded after cell death, so that only viable hyphae are detected with this method. Five months after the end of the acid treatment fungal activity was lower, and the amount of total fungal mycelia was higher compared to the control. Similar results were obtained on alkaline dust polluted sites with a strong pH increase (

; 

). This could be caused by the relatively quick change in the soil solution pH and a successive shift in the microfungal species composition (

). The concentration of ergosterol is species-specific and dependent on the age of the mycelium (

), and changes in the community structure therefore can lead to alterations. On the other hand, the discrepancy between the ergosterol content and the total mycelia mass could be due to the fact that the latter includes both living and dead hyphae. This suggests that, after the increase of the pH at the acid mist plots more dead hyphae were present.
</p>
         <p>
The distribution of roots is related to several soil properties. 

found root density positively correlated with organic C, total N or water soluble P, and negatively with soil pH. In the present experiment a mixture of sulphuric acid and ammonium nitrate was applied on the plots. Acidification and its negative effects on roots therefore could be superimposed by a positive influence of the added N (see also 

). The acid mist treatment caused an acceleration of fine root and mycorrhizal development and their senescence (
Table 2
). This could be due to a better N supply, as well as to a higher root turnover, caused by a persistent acidification stress impact on the trees. However, no visible above-ground damage on needles was observed (

). In addition to root density, the symbiosis between root tips and mycorrhizal fungi is important for the functioning of the root system. Soil acidification as well as nitrogen amendments can influence the development of ectomycorrhiza negatively (

; 

; 

; 

). The frequency of shrivelled, absorptively non-functioning mycorrhizal formations increased slightly at the acid mist plots, suggesting a higher root turnover as mentioned above. However, no differences were statistically significant because of a very high variation between single trees. This variability is demonstrated by the ingrowth method (

; 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Only a few studies on the distribution of free-living nematodes in British soils are available. Most of them describe populations in grasslands or moorlands (

, 

; 

; 

; 

). In the present study a Sitka spruce stand was investigated. Altogether 79 species were identified and some of them were new records for Britain. The trees are growing on formerly agricultural land and the ground was partly covered by grasses. Both conditions appear to influence the composition of the nematode fauna. Compared to other European coniferous forests, some typical genera, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Teratocephalus
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
Wilsonema
</tp:taxon-name>
, were rare or missing and the species number and frequency of plant parasites was high (see 

; de Goede &amp; 

; 

; 

). Among plant parasites 

found 5 dominant genera under Sitka spruce in Scotland. Two of them, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rotylenchus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 

<tp:taxon-name>Paratylenchus</tp:taxon-name>
,

were also very common at the spruce stand investigated. The main difference to his observations was the low occurrence of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Tylencholaimus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Helicotylenchus
</tp:taxon-name>
, which were scarce in Glencorse soils. All predatory species were also less frequent.
</p>
         <p>
Acidification caused a distinct decrease in species number, especially among K-strategists such as predators or omnivores. In contrast, population density was not altered. Similar results were reported by 

and 

in soil microcosm or field experiments. Other authors found a decrease in numbers of nematodes after acidification (

; 

). The soils in both treatments were only slightly acid, and the decrease of some sensitive species is likely to be compensated by an increase of others, leading to changes in the dominance structure as observed in this experiment.
</p>
         <p>
Most nematodes in forest soils feed on bacteria or fungi (

), and variations in pH affect their food source, the soil microorganisms. 

reported that changes in nematode community structure are related to changes in the food availability and in consequence to microbial changes in the soil. Bacterial feeders were the most abundant group in the present plots. Their proportion of the nematode community was not altered by acidification, suggesting adequate bacterial food supply in the soil. This corresponds with results of 

and 

, who found relatively constant bacterial numbers but altered bacterial assemblages after acidification. As discussed above, the active fungal biomass was higher in the upper soil layer after acidification, but decreased after the end of the treatment. The same trend was shown by the fungal feeding nematodes. This indicates that the species composition of nematodes changes with the presence or absence of active fungal hyphae. In microcosm experiments 

found changing fungal production in soil led to similar observations.
</p>
         <p>
Most affected by acid treatment were omnivores and predators. Generally, these nematodes are K-strategists with low reproduction rate and long life-cycles (

). 

and 

report that especially the dorylaimid fauna is negatively affected by highly disturbed forest sites. In the present experiment their populations did not recover 5 months after the end of the acidification. They seem to be very sensitive to environmental disturbance and may be of good use as bioindicators in soil ecosystems.
</p>
         <p>
In summary artificial acidification led to distinct changes in nematode community structure and to an increase of the active fungal biomass in the soil, which was followed by a shift towards fungal feeding nematodes. This shows that nematodes are interacting with other organisms or components in their soil environment. Variation in soil chemical properties, like the solution pH, will be reflected by the structure of the nematode community. Considering this, and the influence of nematodes in increasing the turnover of soil bacteria and fungi, and consequently plant nutrient cycling (see 

) investigations of nematode-plant-microorganisms interactions are a central point in the future.
