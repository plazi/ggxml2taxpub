Abstract
</title>
         <p>
Soil nematodes are major microfaunal grazers that drive the turnover of organic matter as they foster the activity of microorganisms. The latter are an essential component for water purification processes. The present study is the first study that investigates the nematode community along an entire depth transect from top soil to the vadose zone at a forested groundwater recharge area, the ‘Lange Erlen’, which provides drinking water to the city of Basel (
Switzerland
). Vertical core drills were performed from 
0–450 cm
depth at two locations in the study area. The vertical transect was divided into 
30 cm
thick soil sections. Nematodes were extracted, counted, identified and divided into five trophic groups (i.e. plant feeders, fungal feeders, bacterial feeders, omnivores, predators). Based on the classification of functional groups the Maturity Index (
MI
), Plant Parasitic Index (
PPI
), as well as the Shannon-Weaver Index (
H’
) were assessed.
</p>
         <p>
A total of 67 taxa were identified comprising 26 nematode families. The nematode population density was low with an average of 6.26 and 0.85 ind./ 
10 g
DW soil across depths at the sampling sites HST and VW, respectively. Density decreased strongly with depth, with on average 46 % of the total nematode density located in the uppermost soil layer (
0–30 cm
). Although soil samples were taken down to a depth of 
450 cm
, no nematodes were found below 
240 cm
, except for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cephalobus persegnis
Bastian, 1865
</tp:taxon-name>
, which was the only species present in the lower vadose zone (
220–450 cm
). Plant feeders were the dominant trophic group (65%) throughout the entire depth transect. Decomposition was mainly mediated by the bacterial carbon and energy channel as indicated by the low number of fungal feeders. The general low 
MI
, 
PPI
and 
H’
were neither depth nor site dependent, suggesting similar environmental conditions at the two investigated locations due to frequent flooding. SIMPER analysis revealed that the dissimilarity in nematode community patterns at HST and VW increased with depth. Plant feeders contributed to the community dissimilarity in the upper soil layers, while the impact of bacterial feeders increased with depth, indicating that the main resource changes along the depth profile.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Nematodes are the most abundant soil metazoa with up to 30 million individuals per square meter (

). They occur worldwide in almost all soil 
types
from arctic regions to the tropics, with a maximum diversity generally observed in temperate broadleaf forests (

). However, 

report the huge number of 431 morpho-species from a single tropical forest site. Molecular studies suggest nematodes to be the second most diverse metazoa group on earth with around a million different species (

). Moreover, nematodes have evolved feeding groups at each trophic level of the soil food web (

)
</p>
         <p>
Although nematodes are common animals in groundwater (

), their abundance and diversity can be highly variable due to the heterogeneity and constant changes of groundwater habitats (

). Nevertheless, the occurrence of nematodes in nearly all soils, their high density as well as great species and trophic diversity, makes nematodes a useful biomarker group for soil nutrient status, functioning and disturbance. Nematodes react quickly and specifically to environmental changes. For example, bacterial grazers are good indicators for the decomposition rate of organic matter: Due to their position in the food chain just above microorganisms, the abundance of bacterial grazers indicates the abundance of easily-decomposable organic matter (

). Further, the high trophic diversity of nematodes offers the possibility for assessing the availability of food resources and of prey communities (

).
</p>
         <p>
For the analysis of the soil state and functioning several diagnostic concepts have been developed to supply information on the environmental conditions for soil organisms (

).
</p>
         <p>
A feasible way to estimate the magnitude of soil disturbance is the Maturity Index (
MI
). This concept uses weighted 
c-p
values for nematode families, which represent different life history strategies with 
r
- and 
K
-strategists located at each end of a scale from 
c-p
1 to 5 (

).
</p>
         <p>
Artificial groundwater recharge systems are a common practice for water purification in which large areas are periodically, i.e. artificially, flooded. Thereby, surface and subsurface microbial communities are major contributors to pollutant degradation and maintenance of groundwater quality (

). Frequently, unvegetated sand filters are used, comprising of microorganisms, microfauna and small crustaceans building a biofilm matrix, are responsible for water purification (

). Microorganisms have been studied on account of the mechanism for contaminant attenuation in upper soil layers (

) as well as in deeper soil horizons down to 
10 m
soil depth (

). However, investigations of the accompanied soil fauna are scarce. Especially nematodes as major microbial grazer may have a significant impact on degradation processes. By their feeding activity nematodes enhance mineralization processes and liberate nutrients bound in microbial biomass for plant uptake (

). In particular bacterial feeders contribute significantly to these processes by grazing on and assimilation of microbial tissue and thereby altering microbial community composition (

).
</p>
         <p>
The present study investigates a groundwater recharge zone used to obtain drinking water for the city of Basel (
Switzerland
). This site is a former floodplain area of the river Wiese called ‘Lange Erlen’ that was altered by artificial landfill and afforestation in the 1970s and 1980s. Embanked forested sites are regularly flooded by water of the river Rhine to increase groundwater resources. In contrast to the common sand filter systems, no biofilm is generated. Nevertheless, water infiltration and purification capacity is still satisfying despite of the long performance of the system since 1912 (

). To date, the processes of water purification are not understood in detail. Recent studies in the ‘Lange Erlen’ reported an altered microbial community structure due to periodic flooding, predominantly in the upper vadose zone (

, 

). The vadose zone extends from the soil surface to the groundwater table lacking permanent water saturation (Holden &amp; 

). 

, 

) further indicated that nutrient limitations were reversed due to flooding with Rhine water, allowing a specialized microbial community to effectively degrade organic compounds.
</p>
         <p>
For these microbial investigations, core drillings from the soil surface down to a maximum of 
450 cm
depth were performed at the ‘Lange Erlen’. This offered the unique possibility to study the accompanied nematode fauna in a transect from the top soil to the aquifer. Studies that investigated the functional properties of the vertical distribution of nematodes either focused only on the first 
100 cm
of the depth profile (e.g. 

), or considered single nematode trophic groups (

). The few studies that reported nematode findings from soil layers deeper than 
200 cm
, however, did not focus on the vertical distribution of nematode assemblages (e.g. Hilberg &amp; Eisendle-Flöckner 2016).
</p>
         <p>To the best of our knowledge the present work is the first investigation of the nematode fauna in an entire depth transect from top soil to the aquifer. The objectives of this study were to assess the vertical distribution of the nematode fauna in this periodically flooded ecosystem in order to (i) identify nematode taxa along a depth gradient, from the top soil over the vadose zone to the groundwater table (ii) determine the relationship between soil properties and resources and nematode density and trophic structure, and (iii) detect the changes of the nematode community structure and diversity along the investigated depth gradient.</p>

2.1 Infiltration system
</title>
         <p>
For artificial groundwater recharge the water of the river Rhine is pre-filtered through a rapid sand filter (
80 cm
quartz sand filter). Afterwards it is periodically seeped into 11 wooded flooding areas (total area 22 ha). Each flooding area has a dimension of 1 to 2 hectare and is divided into three fields with a size of 
3000 to 8500 m
2
by dams with a height of about 
50 cm
. Ten days of flooding is usually followed by 20 days of drying and regeneration. Due to revisions, longer interruptions occur. Depending on soil surface structure and the percolation time water fills up to variable heights with a maximum of 
50 cm
. The percolation occurs with a speed of 
1 to 2 m
day-1
through mull humus and fluvial silt layer of 
30–90 cm
, followed by a sand/gravel layer of 
2–3 m
before reaching the groundwater table at

depth. Additionally, the water flows horizontally from northeast to southwest within the aquifer for 

200 to 
800 m.

After the average retention time in the aquifer of 10–30 days, purified water is pumped out of groundwater wells and collected in the pumping station. Following a brief chemical treatment with chloride dioxide (ClO

2.2 Study sites
</title>
         <p>
The study sites are located in the north east of the city Basel, 
Switzerland
(for map, see 

). The area ‘Lange Erlen’ with a size of about three square kilometres is part of the semi-natural floodplain of the river Wiese, descending from the southwest Black Forest, 
Germany
. It is a straightened tributary of the river Rhine. A part of the ‘Lange Erlen’ is used since 1912 for artificial groundwater recharge and allocates today nearly half of the drinking water (15 x 

106
m

3 ha-1
year-1
) of the city Basel.
</p>
         <p>
The semi-natural forest sites of the ‘Lange Erlen’ are characterized as 
Galio-Carpinetum
(i.e oak-hornbeam) forests (

). The regularly flooded sites have been modified by activities such as landfill as well as afforestation with poplars (
<tp:taxon-name>
Populus canadensis
</tp:taxon-name>
), ash (
<tp:taxon-name>
Fraxinus excelsior
</tp:taxon-name>
), alder (
<tp:taxon-name>
Alnus nigra
</tp:taxon-name>
) and willows (
<tp:taxon-name>
Salix
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
) (

). The upper soil layer is classified as fluvi-eutric cambisol, and the aquifer is composed of 80% Rhine gravel (the lower part consists mostly of limestone) and 20% Wiese gravel (upper part, mostly silicates and limestone) (

).
</p>
         <p>
The first sampling site, ‘Hintere Stellimatten’ (HST), was established in 1977 after afforestation. By reason of too high infiltration rates (
11 m
3 m-2 d-1
) and in consequence of insufficient retention time an artificial landfill (loess loam) and soil compaction by bulldozing was performed in 1981. The site is mainly overgrown with an alder swamp forest containing 
<tp:taxon-name>

, 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. nigra
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Salix

</tp:taxon-name>
while the herb layer is dominated by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rubus caesius
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Urtica dioica
</tp:taxon-name>
. On unvegetated regions some small spots of

<tp:taxon-name>
Potentilla reptans
</tp:taxon-name>

Agropyron repens
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
G. urbanum
</tp:taxon-name>
occurred.
</p>
         <p>
The second sampling site, ‘Verbindungsweg’ (VW), was established as flooding area after artificial landfill (loess loam) and afforestation in 1970. The forest is composed of old poplars, ash-leaved maple (
<tp:taxon-name>
Acer negundo
</tp:taxon-name>
) and oak trees. The understory consists of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lysimachia nummularia

2.3 Sampling
</title>
         <p>
Soil sampling at the sites HST and VW took place in 
November 2005
. To do so, the groundwater level had to be lowered by stopping the flooding interval four weeks before sampling. For analyses, the depth profile was sectioned randomly in three zones: The surface soil layer reached from 
0 to 100 cm
soil depth, whereat the section from 
0 to 30 cm
soil depth is referred to as ‘uppermost soil layer’ in this study. The unsaturated layer below, i.e. the vadose zone, comprises solid, aqueous and gaseous compartments with rapidly changing soil conditions from saturation to desiccation (

). The vadose zone was separated into upper vadose zone (
100–220 cm
soil depth) and lower vadose zone (
220–450 cm
soil depth). The groundwater table was reached below a soil depth of 
450 cm
.
</p>
         <p>
For the depth transect three vertical core drillings (diameter 
25 cm
) were taken on each site from the soil surface to the groundwater level in 
450 cm
depth by a construction company (Glanzmann, Basel, 
Switzerland
). Cores were taken in sections of 
50 cm
. Afterwards the cores were transferred into soil core boxes, representing the entire depth transect. Subsequently, soil samples were taken every 
30 cm
along the soil profile resulting in 14 soil layers that represent the entire depth transect (
0–30 cm
, 
30–60 cm
, 
60–90 cm
, 
90–120 cm
, 
120–150 cm
, 
150–180 cm
, 
180–210 cm
, 
210–240 cm
, 
240–270 cm
, 
270–300 cm
, 
300–330 cm
, 
330–360 cm
, 
360–390 cm
, 
390–450 cm
). The soil samples of each layer were taken with a shovel from the inner part of the cores.
</p>
         <p>
For the soil analysis (including PLFA analysis), 
100 g
fresh weight (FW) soil were taken per sample, transported to the laboratory and frozen (-20°C) until analysis. Before conducting all analyses, i.e. determination of soil parameters and PLFA analysis, the soil samples were thawed at 8°C for 24 h. Visible organic material (fine roots and leaves) were removed and the soil was sieved (
5 mm
mesh size). Overall, 42 soil samples were taken at each site along the entire depth transect. For the investigation of the nematode fauna, another 
100 g
FW soil were taken per sample and stored for 3–5 days at 7–8°C until nematode extraction. All soil samples were weighed before and after extraction and nematode numbers were given as individuals per 
10 g
dry weight (DW) soil. On average, 
50 g
FW soil was extracted by a modified Baermann method according to 

. This comprises 24 h extraction at room temperature (18–20°C), followed by a heating regime temperature program for 6 h started with 20°C and raised at 5°C/h to 45°C. Overall, 84 nematode samples were extracted, three replicates from each of the 14 soil layers of the entire depth transect (
0–450 cm
) at HST and VW.
</p>
         <p>The nematodes were preserved by addition of 4 % cold formaldehyde solution and stored in vials until examination in a fridge at a temperature of 8°C. Despite careful handling one sample of each site got lost by leakage of damaged vials. Nevertheless, the missing samples did not affect statistical analyses and interpretation.</p>

2.4 Soil analysis
</title>
         <p>2.4.1 Chemical and physical soil parameters</p>
         <p>
The chemical and physical characteristics of the soil were analyzed to detect variations of pH, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate (NO 
3
-
), sulfate (SO 
4
2-
) and moisture content. The soil pH was measured in 0.01 M calcium chloride (CaCl 
2
) solution (1: 4 w/v) after stirring and incubating at room temperature for 1 h. Total soil contents of C and N were analyzed from oven-dried (65°C, 3 days) and pulverized (swing mill, Retsch MM 200) aliquots of the bulk soil with an element analyzer (CHN 1000, Leco, 
USA
). Results are given in percentage of the soil DW. The determination of the soil moisture content was performed by drying the soil samples at 105°C for 24 h and calculating the mass difference before and after drying.

(1: 4 w/v) was prepared, shaken for 1 h (200r.p.m.) and centrifuged for 15 min (

450

). Supernatants of each soil solution were filtered through sterile membrane filters (0.45 µm; Millex, HA, 
USA
) and stored in the fridge (1 h) until analysis. DOC analysis was carried out after acidification and airpurging (N55, O45, Carbagas, Gümligen, 
Switzerland
) with a TOC analyzer (TOC-5000 A, Shimadzu) in quintuplicate. NO

2.5 Nematode fauna
</title>
         <p>
Total nematode numbers extracted from each sample were counted under a dissecting microscope (Axiolab, Zeiss, Oberkochen, 
Germany
) using 100 xmagnification. Further, 10 % of each sample but not less than 100 individuals were determined to species or genus level. The identification of the nematodes was performed using the Axiolab microscope coupled with a three mega pixel digital camera (ScopeTek, DCM 310) and picture imaging software (ScopeTek, ScopePhoto 3.0.12) to assess body ratios according to de Man’s formula (

). Nematodes were identified using the keys of 

, 

and 

, 

, 

) and assigned to feeding 
types
according to 

. The subgroups sedentary parasites, migratory endoparasites, semi-endoparasites, ectoparasites, root epidermal cell and root hair feeders were all summarised as plant feeders.
</p>
         <p>
Following 

nematode taxa were assigned as colonizers or persisters by their specific 
c-p
values ranging from 1–5. This scale represents different life history strategies where 
c-p
1 consists of 
r
-strategists with high fecundity, small eggs, and short generation time. On the other hand, 
c-p
5 represents 
K
-strategists with low fecundity, large body size, and long generation time. The latter are sensitive to changing environmental conditions and disturbance. Both classifications of feeding 
type
and 
c-p
value enable the assignment to functional guilds and the calculation of indices for rating the ecological state of a soil system in relation to disturbance and functioning (

).
</p>
         <p>
The Maturity Index (
MI
) was calculated by exclusions of plant feeders and dauerlarvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rhabditidae</tp:taxon-name>
as proposed by 

. Dauerlarvae of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rhabditidae</tp:taxon-name>
were detected, but since these are inactive stages, their presence does not indicate current nutrient rich conditions. The trophic group of plant feeders were considered by calculation of the Plant Parasitic Index (
PPI
), following 

:
</p>
         <p>
MI
or 
PPI
= ∑ υ(i) ∙ p(i)
</p>
         <p>
where υ = 
c-p
value of taxon i, p = proportion of taxon i in a sample, with the 
MI
comprising free-living and the 
PPI
plant parasitic taxa.
</p>
         <p>
The biological diversity was measured by computing the Shannon Index of diversity (
H’
) (

):
</p>
         <p>
H’ = -
∑ p(i) ∙ lnp(i)
</p>
         <p>where p = the proportion of species i in the total nematode community.</p>

2.6 Statistics
</title>
         <p>
Statistical analyses were performed using R (version 4.0.2, ‘Taking Off Again’). Firstly, the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and Levene test were applied, followed by the Mann-Whitney-U test and Kruskall-Wallis rank sum test. If significant differences were detected Dunn`s test with Bonferroni correction (significance level at 
P
&lt;0.05) was performed as post hoc test. The Spearman’s rank order correlation coefficient was calculated to assign the association between nematode population density and soil parameters. This non-parametric correlation was applied as data did not meet normal distribution. Multivariate statistics were performed with PRIMER 7 (version 7.0.13). The density of nematode populations was subjected to analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), followed by similarity percentages procedure (SIMPER) to determine the differences between sites and depths. The Bray-Curtis similarity index was applied to the data.
</p>
         <p>
For the index calculation and application of multivariate statistics only the depths from 
0 to 120 cm
were taken into account, since there were no obvious differences between nematode communities at HST and VW in deeper soil layers.

The soil texture of the sites differed predominantly in the upper soil layers (
Tab. 1
). Landfill loess loam expanded from the surface to a depth of 
100 cm
at HST but was only present up to a depth of about 
40 cm
at VW. Beneath sand and gravel occurred down to 
400 cm
depth at both sites. Interspersed silt and clay lenses were present in the layers between 160 and 
280 cm
at HST and between 280 and 
340 cm
at VW. Partial FeMn depositions were detected in deeper soil layers, indicating periodical water logging and anoxic conditions.

(3 species, respectively) were most diverse at VW. The highest species diversity at HST occurred in a depth from 
0–30 cm
and declined constantly from a depth of 
60–90 cm
. At VW, the highest species diversity was found in a depth from 
30–60 cm
and decreased rapidly at greater depths. The decline in species number with depth at both sites was significant (Kruskall, HST: 
P
= 0.025; VW: 
P

3.4 Community structure and diversity
</title>
         <p>
The major trophic groups of nematodes across depths (
0–120 cm
) and sites were plant feeders with an average relative abundance of 65 %, followed by bacterial feeders (26 %), omnivores (7 %) and fungal feeders (2 %). Predators were scarce with a proportion of less than 1 % and occurred only at HST (
60–90 cm
depth). Generally, the occurrence of trophic groups was not affected by depth or site.
</p>
         <p>
The overall abundance of nematodes was related to soil parameters and resources across all depths and both sites (
Tab. 5
). In detail, each trophic group was positively correlated to DOC and nitrate (
P
&lt;0.05) at VW. Plant feeders were positively linked to C (
P
&lt;0.05), H (
P
&lt;0.05) and N (
P
&lt;0.05) at HST and VW, respectively. Plant and bacterial feeders showed a positive correlation to PLFAs, which was more pronounced at HST (
P
&lt;0.001 and 
P
&lt;0.01, respectively) than at VW (
P
&lt;0.05 and 
P
&lt;0.05, respectively). A negative correlation occurred between each trophic group at VW and predators at HST and pH, albeit not significantly.
</p>
         <p>
Several indices were calculated to assign the impact of soil depth (
0–120 cm
) on nematode community structure with a focus on disturbance and diversity (
Tab. 6
). Generally, none of the indices were affected by depth or site. The low Maturity Index (
MI
) at HST (1.72 ± 2.44 to 2.95 ± 1.83) and at VW (1.21 ± 1.72 to 2.83 ± 1.44) revealed a high disturbance at both investigated sites. In line with this is the low Plant Parasite Index (
PPI
) ranging from 2.11 ± 0.18 to 2.33 ± 0.17 at HST and from 0.67 to 2.47 ± 0.29 at VW. The diversity at both investigated sites was low as indicated by a Shannon diversity Index (
H’
) ranging from 0.91 ± 0.31 to 1.83 ± 0.65 at HST and from 0 to 1.71 ± 0.57 at VW.

3.5 Community distribution

Multivariate analysis of nematode population density with one-way ANOSIM (habitat x depth) revealed a separation by site but not depth (Global

         <p>
The SIMPER analysis (
Tab. 7
) revealed that the average group dissimilarity between communities was higher between HST and VW (83 %) than within communities at HST (79 %) and VW (78 %). In detail, the highest average group dissimilarity occurred between HST and VW in a depth of 
90–120 cm
(93 %) with the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Cephalobidae</tp:taxon-name>
contributing most to the group dissimilarity with 16 %. The lowest group dissimilarity existed between the depths of 
0–30 cm
and 
30–60 cm
at VW (64 %). In general, 
<tp:taxon-name>Paratylenchidae</tp:taxon-name>
and

were the families that contributed most to the group dissimilarity with an average of 23 % and 14 %, respectively.

4. Discussion
</title>
         <p>
Although nematode findings have been reported down to 
1.4 km
(

), the aspect of depth distribution of nematodes has been studied very rarely so far. Thus, the present work gives first insights about the nematode fauna in an entire depth transect from topsoil to the aquifer. The sampling campaign at the forested flooding site ‘Lange Erlen’ of an artificial groundwater recharge system was carried out together with the authors Schütz et al. Therefore, the results concerning microbial biomass, activity and PLFA patterns cited in the following refer to the same bore cores as the nematode data and are discussed in detail in 

, 

,

4.1 Nematode taxa along a depth gradient
</title>
         <p>
The investigation of the vertical distribution of nematode species along the depth gradient from the soil surface to a depth of 
450 cm
at the ‘Lange Erlen’ revealed a heterogenous distribution pattern of species. Around half of all taxa occurred in only one soil layer which implies the existence of several distinct microhabitats derived from changes in soil physical properties and resource availability. For example, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Heterocephalobus
cf 
bisimilis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Heterocephalobus
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
were restricted to the 
0–30 cm
soil layer. Analogously, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Heterocephalobus
</tp:taxon-name>
was only found in the top soil layer in a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pinus radiata
</tp:taxon-name>
stand (

). All taxa of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Dolichodoridae</tp:taxon-name>
, except 

<tp:taxon-name>Tylenchorhynchus</tp:taxon-name>
,

were restricted to the upper soil layers, i.e. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Merlinius
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Paratrophurus
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
to 
0–30 cm
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Trophurus
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
to 
0–60 cm
soil depth. Although both are ectoparasites and exploit the same resources, the taxa of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Paratylenchidae</tp:taxon-name>
, especially 
<tp:taxon-name>
Gracilacus
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Paratylenchus
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
, did not just have a higher vertical distribution but also a higher abundance than the 
<tp:taxon-name>Dolichodoridae</tp:taxon-name>
. This matches findings from natural birch forests where the abundance of paratylenchids exceeds that of dolichodorids (

). The dominance of 
<tp:taxon-name>Paratylenchidae</tp:taxon-name>
over 
<tp:taxon-name>Dolichodoridae</tp:taxon-name>
is likely caused by their higher colonization potential and tolerance to disturbances (

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cephalobus persegnis
</tp:taxon-name>
was the only species present in the lower vadose zone (
220– 450 cm
). The occurrence of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cephalobus
</tp:taxon-name>
at higher depth corresponds to a study of 

investigating the bacterial grazing nematode community under different land uses in a gradient from surface layer down to 
150 cm
. As 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cephalobus persegnis
</tp:taxon-name>
is the most common species of the genus living in various terrestrial habitats (

) it is not surprising to find exactly this species at greater depth at the ‘Lange Erlen’.
</p>
         <p>
Of all the species found, 52 % are terricolous while 46 % occur also in water habitats. The high proportion of nematodes found in the investigated soil adapted to aquatic environments fits to the periodical flooding at the ‘Lange Erlen’. Even the predominantly limnic 
<tp:taxon-name>
Prodesmodora
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
and the exclusively limnic species 
<tp:taxon-name>
Eumonhystera longicaudatula
</tp:taxon-name>
were found at the artificial water recharge area. Although the flooding water was not examined for nematodes, it is likely that these species were transported into the ‘Lange Erlen’ habitat by flooding with river Rhine water. Even though the soil sampling was carried out four weeks after the last flooding, the ability of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Prodesmodora
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
to exist in terrestrial circumstances (

), presumably allowed it to survive the draining period. Further, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Eumonhystera longicaudatula
</tp:taxon-name>
can be found in the sediment of lakes (

), where environmental conditions may be similar to those in the soil at the ‘Lange Erlen’ floodplain and thus enable survival.
</p>
         <p>
Nevertheless, the most abundant and common species found at the ‘Lange Erlen’ are exclusively terrestrial. In detail, the root feeders 
<tp:taxon-name>
Gracilacus
</tp:taxon-name>
            <tp:taxon-name>ssp. and</tp:taxon-name>
            <tp:taxon-name>
Pratylenchus pseudopratensis
</tp:taxon-name>
were the species with the highest abundance across depths with a total of 149 and 11 individuals in HST and VW, respectively. However, in comparable deciduous forests not affected by inundation the abundances of these two genera were already much higher at a depth of 
0–20 cm
with 510 and 294 individuals for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Gracilacus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pratylenchus
</tp:taxon-name>
, respectively (

), indicating that flooding affects nematode numbers. The most common species were the plant feeders 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rotylenchus quartus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Gracilacus
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Filenchus teres
</tp:taxon-name>
with individuals of each species found in 5 out of 8 different soil depths. Correspondingly, a study investigating the depth distribution of nematodes from the top soil (
0–10 cm
) over the rooted zone (
40–50 cm
) to the root-free zone (
60–70 cm
) in an arable soil reported 
<tp:taxon-name>
Filenchus
</tp:taxon-name>
findings from all three examined soil layers (

). However, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rotylenchus
</tp:taxon-name>
occurred only once in the 
40–50 cm
layer while 
<tp:taxon-name>
Gracilacus
</tp:taxon-name>
was completely absent. This low distribution matches a report from an oak forest where both genera were found in less than half of the samples (

). The high vertical occurrence at the ‘Lange Erlen’ is, therefore, likely caused by the translocation of individuals by flooding with river water.

4.2 Relationship between soil properties and nematode density
</title>
         <p>
The population density of nematodes at the examined regularly flooded forest sites strongly decreased with depth from the surface soil layer (
0–100 cm
) to the lower vadose zone (
220–450 cm
) at HST and VW with on average 46 % of the total nematode density located in the uppermost soil layer (
0–30 cm
). In comparison, the upper and lower vadose zone combined (
100–450 cm
) comprised on average 2 % of the total nematode density. This decline is most likely attributed to a decrease in major resources and changing soil properties (

). Nematode density particularly correlated with the decline of DOC, 
NO
3
-
, SO 
4
2-
, H, C and N, suggesting that mineralization processes take place predominantly in the first 
30 cm
of the soil profile. Correspondingly, microbial biomass and PLFA content were highest in the top soil as reported by 

. Microbial activity i.e. mineralization rates and nutrient supply are highest in the rhizosphere (

). Subsequently, a decline in root density with depth indirectly causes a decline in nematode density as a result of a decreasing number of microorganisms. Mirroring this, nematode numbers strongly decreased below the assumed rooting depth of the herbaceous vegetation cover (approximately at 
90 cm
soil depth) at the ‘Lange Erlen’. The finding of only two nematode individuals in the lower vadose zone (below 
220 cm
soil depth) further underlines the decline in nutrients and microbial food sources along the depth gradient.
</p>
         <p>
On the other hand, nematode density did not correlate with pH, as it hardly fluctuated with depth. This is most likely due to regular flooding with Rhine water at a relatively constant pH value of 8.2 (

).
</p>
         <p>
Nematode densities varied considerably with site, with an average of 9 times higher density at HST than VW. But since the values of the soil parameters of the two sites are similar in the uppermost soil layer (
0–30 cm
), they can be excluded as the cause of the different nematode densities at HST and VW. The only site-specific difference is soil particle size, i.e. a higher amount of artificial landfill exists at HST compared to VW. Presumably, the higher content of silt microaggregates of the landfill layer at HST (down to 
100 cm
) positively affected the nematode community, as nematodes prefer coarse-textured soils (

).
</p>
         <p>
Additionally, nematode densities in the uppermost soil layer (
0–30 cm
) at the ‘Lange Erlen’ were much lower than in comparable riparian forest sites (e.g. 

). However, similar numbers are reported from paddy fields (e.g. 

). The general low nematode densities of flooded habitats compared to non-flooded sites (

) is caused by the waterlogging of soils. The oxygen limitation in such soils depresses nematode activity and abundance (

). Correspondingly, the occurrence of anaerobic conditions at the watered sites at the ‘Lange Erlen’ was indicated by high PLFA iso/anteiso ratios (

).

      <sec sec-type="multiple">
         <title>
4.3 Nematode trophic structure along a depth gradient
</title>
         <p>
In contrast to nematode density, the pattern of trophic groups showed no distinct depth profile. At the ‘Lange Erlen’, frequent flooding events likely caused the vertical transfer of soil microorganisms and nutrients, resulting in soil layers with similar nutritional resources. Underlining this, 

found comparable PLFA profiles, i.e. microbial community patterns at each depth.
</p>
         <p>
The most dominant nematodes in each soil layer (except in 
60–90 cm
depth at VW) were plant feeders (65 % across depths). This matches reports that plant feeders are the main trophic group in riparian forests (

). The top soil was predominated by plant feeders of the ectoparasitic 
<tp:taxon-name>Paratylenchidae (HST)</tp:taxon-name>
and endoparasitic 
<tp:taxon-name>Pratylenchidae (VW)</tp:taxon-name>
. Below a depth of 
90 cm
, the composition of plant-associated nematodes differed between sites: At HST, obligate plant feeders, mainly 
<tp:taxon-name>Paratylenchidae</tp:taxon-name>
dominated. On the other hand, at VW plant feeders belonged exclusively to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Filenchus
</tp:taxon-name>
, facultative root-/fungal feeders (

) with the ability to switch to a fungal-based diet when herbaceous plant roots become sparse. However, no fungal feeders have been detected in this soil layer at VW.
</p>
         <p>
Bacterial feeders occurred with a proportion of 26 % across depths at the ‘Lange Erlen’. The majority of bacterial feeders were 
<tp:taxon-name>Cephalobidae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Plectidae</tp:taxon-name>
, general opportunists (
c-p
2) that survive under food-poor conditions and are very tolerant to disturbances (

). These traits make 
<tp:taxon-name>Cephalobidae</tp:taxon-name>
the predominating nematode family under field conditions worldwide (

). On the other hand, the enrichment opportunists (
c-p
1) 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhabditis
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Eumonhystera
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
occurred only occasional and in low densities pointing to a generally low nutrient availability at the studied sites as these taxa are known for an explosive population growth under food-rich conditions (

).
</p>
         <p>
Fungal feeders were almost completely absent with a proportion of 2 % across depths. Similar findings were reported from paddy fields (

). The lack of fungal feeders indicates a minor importance of the fungal energy channel for the faunal food web at ‘Lange Erlen’. Supporting this, an analysis of soil PLFAs at HST and VW revealed a low ratio of fungi to bacteria ranging from 0.04 to 0.14 across sites and depths (

). Presumably, the frequent flooding and anaerobic conditions suppressed mycorrhizal colonization and diversity (

).
</p>
         <p>
Omnivores and predatory nematodes were only a minor proportion (7 % across depths) of the nematode assemblage, indicating that the soil faunal community supports only few large omnivorous and predacious nematodes. However, their representatives are mostly large individuals. Hence, according to their biomass, they might play a larger role within the soil food web than is indicated by their low abundance. Underlining this, omnivores and predators contributed much to ecosystem function in riparian woodland sites as estimated by their high biomass and metabolic footprint (

).

4.4 Community structure and diversity along a depth gradient
</title>
         <p>
The dissimilarity in nematode community patterns at HST and VW increased with depth, as indicated by SIMPER analysis. Presumably, this is caused by the soil texture at HST and VW, which starts to differ at 
40 cm
soil depth. Moreover, SIMPER analysis unveiled that plant feeders contributed most to the community dissimilarity in the upper soil layer, while the impact of bacterial feeders increased with depth. Likely, the differing plant species in the herb layer at HST and VW shaped distinct assemblages of plant feeders in the top soil. Correspondingly, 

reported that vegetation composition influences nematode assemblages. On the other hand, in deeper soil layers (below 
90 cm
soil depth), which lack herbaceous plant roots, bacterial resources became more important in shaping the nematode communities at the ‘Lange Erlen’.
</p>
         <p>
The state of the ecosystem in relation to disturbance was assessed by the calculation of the indices 
MI
and 
PPI
. Both indices were low with values of 2.0 and 1.9 for 
MI
and 
PPI
across depths and sites, respectively. Higher values were reported for paddy fields and deciduous forests (

, 

). Thus, it can be assumed that the ‘Lange Erlen’ area is a relatively disturbed habitat. The cyclical disturbance of waterlogging causes changes in temperature as well as aerobic and anaerobic conditions unfavorable for certain nematode taxa. Accordingly, long-living 
K
-strategists that are characteristic for habitats with a long durational stability (

), e.g. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Prodorylaimus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Eudorylaimus
</tp:taxon-name>
occurred only sporadically, as they experience several flooding and regeneration events at the ‘Lange Erlen’. On the other hand, short-living 
r
-strategists that are tolerant to a wide range of environmental factors (

) and probably experienced only one flooding cycle, dominated the nematode fauna at ‘Lange Erlen’. Further, 
MI
and 
PPI
showed no clear depth related pattern, indicating varying degrees of disturbance along the depth profile. Contrasting this, a PLFA analysis at HST and VW revealed that the stress indicating 
trans/cis
ratio was constant with depth (

), indicating similar levels of disturbance in different soil layers.
</p>
         <p>
The diversity of the nematode community, expressed as the index 
H’
, was low with values between 0.9 and 1.8 across sites and depth. Low nematode diversity as consequence of disturbance has been reported for a wide range of habitats (

). Like 
MI
and 
PPI
, 
H’
showednodepthdependency, butratherfluctuatingvalues along the depth profile. Likely, spatial heterogeneity, e.g. due to differing pore sizes or changes in soil physical properties, created microhabitats with distinct nematode metacommunities and diversities (

).

5. Conclusion
</title>
         <p>
The present study is the first investigation of the nematode fauna in an entire depth transect from top soil to the vadose zone providing new insights on the functional properties of the vertical distribution of nematodes. Analyzing the species composition of the nematode community revealed a heterogenous distribution pattern of species along the depth gradient, implying the existence of distinct microhabitats. Nematode population density strongly decreased along the depth profile, which was associated to a decline in DOC, 
NO
3
-
, SO 
4
2-
, H, C and N. This suggests that mineralization processes take place predominantly in the uppermost soil layer (
0–30 cm
) at ‘Lange Erlen’. Opposing nematode density, trophic structure was not altered by depth, pointing to similar nutritional conditions along the depth profile, presumably caused by flushes through frequent flooding. Decomposition was mainly mediated by the bacterial carbon and energy channel as indicated by the lack of fungal feeders. Long-term water recharge practice enhanced the overall disturbance and reduced diversity, resulting in a nematode community mainly composed of opportunistic taxa with a wide ecological amplitude.
</p>
         <p>All in all, the nematode survey at species level enabled investigations of the nematode community composition in a very high resolution. Additionally, the quantification and evaluation of the disturbance level at the ‘Lange Erlen’ caused by artificial water recharge highlights the importance of nematodes as biomarkers.</p>
