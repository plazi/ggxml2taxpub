â Trends of the current dispersal of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
in Ukraine are analysed, which are closely related to the activities of several garden centres, which export a part of the sold seedlings of ornamental and garden plants from other European countries. Using 
Lviv
and its environs as an example, we compared the qualitative and quantitative phenotypic composition of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
at sites where both 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
species
</tp:taxon-name>
or only 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
were recently introduced. On average, the former were characterised by a greater phenotypic diversity of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
, which may be due to a greater number of founding individuals of such colonies. At the sites of the second group, hereditary traits (brown ground colour, shell with three lower bands) or phenotypes (yellow unbanded), which are less common in the study area, were more often absent. Also, a clearly pronounced predominance of any one variant of the shell colouration was more often noted there, most often pink unbanded or yellow mid-banded.

Introduction
</title>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea nemoralis
(Linnaeus, 1758)
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
(O. F. MÃ¼ller, 1774)
</tp:taxon-name>
are among the best known species of European terrestrial mollusks. Many publications have been devoted to the colour and banding polymorphism of their shells, including a number of generalizations and discussions (

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

).The first species is of Western European origin, the second one is of Central European origin (

; 

), and their natural ranges partially overlap and covering large areas of Western, Central, and Northern Europe.
</p>
         <p>
For 
Ukraine
, both 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
species
</tp:taxon-name>
are alien. Although the first attempt to introduce 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
to the west of the country (to 
Lviv
) was made already at the end of the 19th century (

), most of the reliable records of this species in 
Ukraine
were made only in recent years (

; 

; 

, 2021 b). The rapid spreading of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
in settlements is now observed also in other Eastern European countries, which can be associated both with global climate change and with the activities of numerous garden centres that import seedlings of ornamental and garden plants (Gural-Sverlova et al., 2021 Ð°).
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
was introduced into Western 
Ukraine
no later than the 1970s (Gural-Sverlova &amp; Gural, 2021 b). When our observations began in the late 1990s, it was a typical representative of Lviv's terrestrial mollusk fauna (

). Recently, however, thanks to the activities of the same garden centres, the shell colouration variants that are not typical for the descendants of the primary introduction began to appear here (Gural-Sverlov &amp; Gural, 2022 a, b). Often these phenotypes are found together with relatively young colonies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
, which may indicate a possible joint introduction of the two species with ornamental plants from garden centres (Gural-Sverlova &amp; Gural, 2021 b).
</p>
         <p>
In this paper, using 
Lviv
and its immediate environs as an example, we aim to assess the frequency of co-introductions of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, and to compare the phenotypic diversity of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
from sites where such introductions were or were not recorded. We also want to compare current trends in the spread of both 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
species
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Ukraine
, particularly in the western part of the country.

Material and Methods
</title>
         <p>
The
phenotypic composition of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
samples was analyzed at 36 sites in 
Lviv
and its immediate environs (Malekhiv, Pidbirtsi, Solonka, Zubra), where at least 
10 adults
or juveniles with a shell diameter of at least 
1 cm
were collected in 2019â2022. Since dark spiral bands in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
</tp:taxon-name>
do not appear immediately and simultaneously on the shells of juveniles (

; 

; 

, 

), the use of smaller snails can lead to incorrect identification of phenotype groups. The coordinates of the studied sites are given in table 1

.
</p>
         <p>If the studied colonies were found close to each other and could have a common origin, such sites were designated by the same number with different lowercase letters.For example, this applies to different ornamental plantings in the Pivdennyi market (sites 10 a, 10 b and 10 c), separated by rather large anthropogenic barriers that prevent the free movement of snails.</p>
         <p>
For quantitative analysis, only 28 sites were used, where at least 
20 adult
live snails or their empty shells were collected. If two independent collections by different authors were carried out on the same site (sites 2, 10 c, 11), the average frequencies of phenotype groups were used for calculations.
</p>
         <p>
As in previous publications (

; 

; Gural-Sverlova et al., 2021 b), the collected phenotypes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
were divided into 9 groups according to the combination of the shell ground colour and banding:
</p>
         <p>Y-0 â yellow unbanded;</p>
         <p>Y-1 â yellow mid-banded (with one central band);</p>
         <p>Y-3 â yellow three-banded (with three lower bands);</p>
         <p>Y-5 â yellow five-banded;</p>
         <p>P-0, P-1, P-3, P-5 â similar for pink shells;</p>
         <p>B-0 â brown unbanded.</p>
         <p>
About the nature of inheritance of these traits, see 

. The group of yellow shells traditionally included not only those with different yellow intensity, but also shells with a white ground colour (

: fig. 12), which are less common in 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, white and yellow shells were considered separately, which is of particular importance for studying the spreading history of this species in 
Ukraine
(Gural-Sverlova &amp; Gural, 2021 b, 2022 a, b). Orange shells in both species were assigned to the pink group.
</p>
         <p>
At all the studied sites, the presence or absence of such specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
was additionally noted, which had the shell colouration variants, absent in the descendants of the primary introduction of the species to Western 
Ukraine
(see Introduction): yellow banded, pink or brown, dark lip (

, b: 
figs 2â5
). As another trait indirectly indicating the presence of a relatively recent joint introduction of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
to the studied sites, a well-pronounced variability in the body colouration of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
was considered. In the descendants of the primary introduction of this species to Western 
Ukraine
, the body is always light, without a distinct gray or reddish pigmentation, and the shell colouration is limited to three main variants: white unbanded, white banded, yellow unbanded (Gural-Sverlova &amp; Gural, 2021 b: 
fig. 3A
, 2022 b: 
fig 1
).
</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>
For a qualitative comparison of the phenotypic composition of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
at the studied sites and the corresponding dendrogram, the Jaccard similarity index was used. For quantitative comparison, the index of phenotypic similarity of samples was calculated: where m is the total number of phenotype groups recorded at the two compared sites; p 
1
, p 
2
â¦ p 
m
are the frequencies of phenotype groups at one site; q
</p>
         <p>1</p>
         <p>, q</p>
         <p>2</p>
         <p>â¦ q</p>
         <p>m</p>
         <p>are the frequencies of the same groups at another site.</p>
         <p>
To assess the phenotypic diversity in the analyzed samples, in addition to the number of phenotype groups (m), two indices proposed by 

were used: the index of intrapopulation diversity (á© and the rate of rare morphs (h):
</p>
         <p>
Âµ = (+ + ... +) 
2
;
</p>
         <p>Âµ</p>
         <p>h = 1â;</p>
         <p>m</p>
         <p>the symbols are similar to the previous formula.</p>
         <p>
According to 

, the indexâ evaluates the degree of phenotypic diversity. Its values vary from 
1 in
monomorphic populations (samples) to m in the case of equal frequencies of all phenotypes (in our case, groups of phenotypes). The index h evaluates the structure of diversity. Its values decrease to zero in monomorphic populations and in the case of equal frequencies of all phenotypes (phenotype groups) and increase with an increase in the heterogeneity of their quantitative ratio.

In 
2019â2022 in
Lviv
and its immediate environs (
fig. 1
), we found 14 sites with the shell colouration variants of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
that are not typical for descendants of the primary introduction of this species to Western 
Ukraine
(see Material and Methods). The locations of 12 of them, as well as the phenotypic composition of the samples collected there, are in previous publications (

: 
table 3
; 2022 b: table 2). The remaining two sites discovered in 2022 are characterised below.
</p>
         <p>

1) The territory of the Pivdennyi market, several flower beds with ornamental shrubs near the sculpture of a Cossack, site 10 c in table 1. Two snails (
one adult
, 
one juvenile
) had banded shells with a light yellow apex. The phenotype Y-0 prevailed. Of the 
50 adult
live snails collected in 
September
, 94 % had yellow shells without dark spiral bands. 
The
sample also included single white banded, white unbanded, and yellow banded (see above) specimens. 
In
other areas of the market landscaped with ornamental plants (sites 10 a, 10 b, etc.), only 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
and/or phenotypes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
typical for 
Lviv
and 
Western
Ukraine
were recorded

Near the building of the business centre Optima Plaza (Naukova Street, No. 7 d), site 
12 in
table 1. Flowerbed with ornamental shrubs, planted in 2015. There was no special sampling of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, however, several specimens of the species with yellow banded and pink unbanded shells were found there in July-August. The latter had a dark lip.
</p>
         <p>
At
11 sites with 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
phenotypes unusual for 
Western
Ukraine
, colonies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
were also found. 
Information
about 10 of them is in table 1. 
Another
case of joint discovery of two 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
species
</tp:taxon-name>
was recorded near the garden centre 
Galsad
between 
Lviv
and 
Davydiv
(
49Â°45'57.1" N
24Â°06'29.6" E
), where we collected only a few specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>

.
</p>
         <p>
Only at three sites in 
Lviv
we found the shell colouration variants of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, not typical for the descendants of the primary introduction, but there was no 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
(
fig. 1
):
</p>
         <p>
1) near the garden centre on Horodotska Street, closed in 2022, 
49Â°49'50.1" N
23Â°57'57.1" E
, yellow banded and pink unbanded shells with a light lip (

: table 2);
</p>
         <p>
2) ornamental shrubs near the mansion on the opposite side of the road, 
49Â°49'47.2" N
23Â°57'50.5" E
, one yellow banded shell of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
;
</p>
         <p>
3) decorative plantings along the streets of General Hrytsai (
49Â°49'39.0" N
24Â°02'47.8" E
) and Mariia Slobodivna (
49Â°49'39.3" N
24Â°02'51.9" E
), yellow banded and pink shells with light lip (

: 
table 3
; 2022 b: table 2).
</p>
         <p>
A dark (from pinkish to reddish-brown) lip in pink, occasionally in yellow shells of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
was found near the garden centre Club of Plants in Pidbirtsi, at one site in Zubra, and at four sites in 
Lviv
(table 1). In all cases, colonies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
were also recorded there.
</p>
         <p>

From 2019 to 2022, we found 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
and/or 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
with regionally rare variants of the shell colouration near 6 garden centres located in 
Lviv
(3 cases) and the surrounding area. In 
Lviv
(site 16), Pidbirtsi (
Club of Plants
), and near Davydiv (Galsad), both were recorded. Only 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
was found at site 
17 in
Lviv
and in Malekhiv, while 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
was represented exclusively by phenotypes common in Western 
Ukraine
and, in particular, in the areas surrounding garden centres. And only in one case, described above, unusually coloured specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, without 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
, were found near the fence of the garden centre

.
</p>
         <p>
In 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
, the frequencies of the analysed phenotype groups and traits (different ground colour or shell banding) varied greatly both at sites where only this species was recently introduced, and at sites where a joint introduction of two 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
species
</tp:taxon-name>
was recorded (table 2). A significant difference was found only for yellow unbanded shells, which are more common in the second group of samples (table 2, 
fig. 2
). Phenotypic diversity, on average, was also greater in the second group, as evidenced by higher values of m and Î¼ (table 2).
</p>
         <p>
Let us compare not the quantitative, but only the qualitative phenotypic composition of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
. In addition to the aforementioned yellow unbanded shells, the first group of samples also more often lacked three-banded (regardless of the ground color) and brown shells (
fig. 3
). These are phenotypes that are less common in the study area as a whole (table 2, 
fig. 2
).
</p>
         <p>
If the ground colour is not taken into account, the shells lacking not only the top two bands, but also all five bands were absent much more often in the first group of samples (
table 3
). Also, there were more frequent cases when several hereditary traits, associated with the complete or partial absence of dark spiral bands on the shell, were absent in one sample: unbanded and three-banded, mid-banded and three-banded.
</p>
         <p>
At sites where no joint introduction of two 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
species
</tp:taxon-name>
was recorded, a clearly pronounced predominance of any one variant of the shell colouration in 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
was more often observed (
fig. 4
). In almost half of the samples from this group used for quantitative analysis (see Material and Methods), the frequencies of such shells exceeded 50 %. Most often, these were pink unbanded shells, half as often yellow mid-banded ones, in one case yellow five-banded ones. Correspondingly, the number of sites with an increased total proportion of the four lightest phenotypes (yellow unbanded and mid-banded, pink unbanded and mid-banded) also increased (
fig. 5
). Their total frequencies exceeded 70 % in almost half of the samples from the first group.
</p>
         <p>
In general, the variability of both quantitative (
fig. 6
) and qualitative (
fig. 7
) composition of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
samples is weakly depended on the spatial location of the studied sites. Closely spaced sites with consecutive numbers were often less similar than more distant pairs of sites. The same can be said about the presence or absence of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
phenotypes, not typical for Western 
Ukraine
, at the studied sites, as well as about the presence among them of a trait that is rare for this species â a dark-coloured lip.
</p>
         <p>
With single exceptions, the studied sites were divided into two groups on both similarity dendrograms (
figs 6â7
). Each of these groups included sites where only 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
colonies or also the colouration variants of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
shells, absent in the descendants of the primary introduction, were recorded.
</p>
         <p>
If we compare the quantitative composition of the samples, in the first group (the upper part of the dendrogram in 
figure 6
), the total number of mid-banded and five-banded shells almost always exceeded the number of unbanded and three-banded ones, up to their complete absence at sites 5, 6, 18, and 28. The opposite trend was observed in the second group. In the samples of the first group, on average, pink unbanded shells were 4.5 times less common and yellow mid-banded shells were 5.5 times more common. A separate cluster in the first group was formed by 3 sites, where the joint introduction of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
was registered, and at the same time yellow unbanded shells of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
were often found.
</p>
         <p>
When comparing the qualitative composition of the phenotypes recorded at the studied sites (
fig. 7
), the first group always contained three-banded shells. The shells with yellow, pink, or brown ground colour combined with a complete absence of bands were found there somewhat more frequently. In this group, cases of joint introduction of two 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
species
</tp:taxon-name>
were noted relatively more commonly. In the second group, three-banded shells were almost always absent, and pink five-banded ones were recorded somewhat more often.
</p>
         <p>
Currently
, both species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
</tp:taxon-name>
are recorded in different parts of 
Ukraine
, however, the largest number of reliable findings is known from the west of the country, especially from the 
Lviv Region
(
fig. 8
)

. 

The
latter pattern is especially noticeable for 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(
fig. 8
, B). In Central 
Ukraine
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
has been increasingly found in recent years in and near 
Kyiv

. 

So
far, there have been no reports of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
</tp:taxon-name>
findings in the 
Crimea

. 

And
the most southern records of both species in 
Ukraine
are those in 
Odesa

.

</p>
         <p>
Despite the frequent occurrence of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
in the urbanised and suburbanised areas of the 
Lviv Region
, most often we are talking about the descendants of the primary introduction of this species into Western 
Ukraine
, with a very limited phenotypic composition, see Material and Methods. Only in recent years, in the west and in other parts of 
Ukraine
, other variants of shell colouration, associated with later and independent introductions, began to be found. So far, they have been reported from a very limited number of settlements (table 4). In such cases, yellow banded shells were most often recorded, and pink shells were somewhat less common.

         <p>

The history of the spreading of both 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
species
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Ukraine
is closely connected with ornamental plantations. Thanks to planned landscaping with ornamental shrubs, which were planted in large numbers as hedges along streets, near railway stations, administrative buildings, educational institutions, hospitals, etc., 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
spread widely in 
Lviv
and reached many other settlements in the 
Lviv Region
already in the second half of the 20th century (
Gural-Sverlova
&amp; 
Gural
, 2021 b, 2022 b)

.
</p>
         <p>
The only reliable record of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
outside the 
Lviv Region
, dating from before the end of the 20th century, was made in Shatsk, 
Volyn Region
. According to O. Korniushin, he discovered 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
in the arboretum of the forest technical school in the early 1990s (

). In 2002 we found several immature snails of this species with yellow unbanded shells on ornamental shrubs in the arboretum. In 2000, 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
was also found near Shatsk, at the biostation of the Ivan Franko National University of 
Lviv
(

), where this species may have been introduced with seedlings of ornamental shrubs from 
Lviv
.
</p>
         <p>

From the beginning of the 20th century to the present, some records of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
were also made in all other administrative regions traditionally attributed to Western 
Ukraine
(
table 5
): 
Ivano-Frankivsk
(known since 2002, own data), 
Khmelnytskyi
(since 2016, observations by 
G. Romanov
), Transcarpathian (since 2015, own data), 
Chernivtsi
(2018, according to iNaturalist, 2023), 
Rivne
(since 2020, the same source), 
Ternopil
(2022, observations by 
L. Bezugla
)

.
</p>
         <p>
However, it is only since 2015 that the phenotypes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, which are absent in the descendants of the primary introduction of this species, have been found in several localities of Western 
Ukraine
(

: 
table 3
; 2022 b: 
figs 2â5
, 
table 3
). Since 2018, some reports of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
findings from other parts of 
Ukraine
, confirmed by photographs of live snails or empty shells, have also started to appear in the analysed databases (iNaturalist, 2023; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Both last trends (the appearance of other shell colouration variants and a significant expansion of the range of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Ukraine
to the east and south) actually coincided in time with the beginning of an increasingly frequent registration in different parts of the country of a related species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
(

; 

; 

, 2021 a, b; iNaturalist, 2023, 

). Unlike 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, most of the reports about 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Ukraine
made before the end of the 20th century were most likely based on the incorrect identification of shells of the autochthonous species 
<tp:taxon-name>

Notes. The table systematizes data from the end of the 20th century to 2022 used for distribution maps (

</p>
         <p>
al., 2021 a). The latter is widely distributed in 
Ukraine
, and was previously also assigned to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
In particular, by the end of the 20th century, only one small colony of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
was known in 
Lviv
(

), which subsequently became almost completely extinct (

). Previously, we assumed that the process of fairly rapid colonization of 
Lviv
by 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
began at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries or a little later, at the very beginning of the 21st century (Gural-Sverlova et al., 2021 a). This coincides with the end of a sharp economic decline in 
Ukraine
in the 1990s and the beginning of an active and almost uncontrolled import of garden and ornamental plants from other European countries. At about the same time, the warming of the climate as a result of global changes is becoming increasingly noticeable. Significantly, the rapid spread of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
through urban areas has recently been observed also in 
Belarus
and the European part of 
Russia
(Gural-Sverlova et al., 2021 a; iNaturalist, 2023). A clear link between the spread of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
and horticulture was already mentioned by 

.
</p>
         <p>
Most of the new (from 2019 to 2022) records of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Lviv
were made on or near sites where ornamental plants, especially the now fashionable conifers, were planted relatively recently. Several typical cases are shown in Gural-Sverlova et al. (2021 a: 
fig. 2
). According to our observations, junipers and other low-growing conifers are the main contributors, creating favourable conditions for snails even on constantly mowed lawns.
</p>
         <p>
The crucial role of garden centres in the current distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
</tp:taxon-name>
is confirmed by the frequent presence near them of both 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
and phenotypes of 

<tp:taxon-name>C. hortensis</tp:taxon-name>
,

which until recently were not found in Western 
Ukraine
. Of particular interest among the latter is the dark lip (

: 
figs 3â4
), a hereditary trait that is locally present even in the natural range of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(

; 

). We found that carriers of this trait in 
Lviv
and the surrounding area spread from the Club of Plants (

, b), one of the largest local garden centres.
</p>
         <p>
If for 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
we were able to identify several convenient phenotypic markers associated with different times and sources of its introduction into 
Ukraine
(

, b), this is impossible for 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Moreover, the general patterns of phenotypic variability in 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
are quite similar even in neighbouring Eastern European countries (Gural-Sverlova et al., 2021 a; 

; 

). The only exception so far can be considered shells with unevenly pigmented (spotted) bands found in one settlement of the 
Ternopil Region
(Gural-Sverlova et al., 2021 a: 
fig. 5
; 

).
</p>
         <p>
In 
Lviv
and its environs, colonies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
are now found much more often than the shell colouration variants of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, which are unusual for Western 
Ukraine
(
fig. 1
). This may indirectly indicate that unintentional transfers of individuals of the first species from garden centres to landscaped sites of the study area occur also more often. Another explanation could be the poorer survival of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
at newly colonised sites. However, this hypothesis contradicts the successful introduction of this species into Western 
Ukraine
already in the second half of the 20th century, see above.
</p>
         <p>
It is significant that at the sites where both 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
species
</tp:taxon-name>
were relatively recently introduced, the samples of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
show greater phenotypic diversity. They also less often lack phenotypes (yellow unbanded) or traits (brown shells, ones with three lower bands), which are less common in Western 
Ukraine
(Gural-Sverlova et al., 2021 b; 

) as well as in other parts of Eastern Europe and in the present range of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
as a whole (Gural-Sverlova et al., 2021 a; 

). The absence of rarer forms in newly formed colonies may be due to a smaller number of founding individuals, to which we include not only adult and juvenile snails, but also eggs, which may be in the ground on the roots of seedlings. It is very likely that a greater number of planted seedlings âinfectedâ with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
</tp:taxon-name>
increases the likelihood of the formation of both a mixed colony of two species, and a 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
colony with a large variety of shell colouration.
</p>
         <p>
The initial limitation of genetic and phenotypic diversity may also cause a more pronounced predominance of any one group of phenotypes in 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
at sites, where the joint introduction of two 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
species
</tp:taxon-name>
was not recorded (
fig. 4
). However, the fact that this occurs most often with light phenotypes, and that the total frequency of the four lightest variants of shell colouration also often increases (
fig. 5
), may also indicate possible selective nature of the observed patterns. The possible selective advantages of lighter phenotypes in introduced populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea
</tp:taxon-name>
, which are often forced to adapt to life in a more continental climate, were discussed by us in a previous publication (

). 

showed that the experimental formation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
colonies with an initially limited phenotypic composition can lead to a noticeable increase in the proportion of one of the light phenotypes. We analyzed the results of this experiment in more detail earlier (

).
</p>
         <p>
Ð¡onclusions
</p>
         <p>
Considering the increasing number of records of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Ukraine
and the general trends in its current spreading in Eastern Europe, we can draw the following conclusions. Already in the near future, this species may become a common component of the land mollusk fauna of urbanised areas, primarily in Western 
Ukraine
and 
Kyiv Region
. Although 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
can spread in the same way, and often from the same garden centres, the process of its dispersal in different parts of 
Ukraine
can be slower. Only in the 
Lviv Region
, where 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
had spread widely already by the end of the 20th century, this species can remain more common than 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
for a long time.
</p>
         <p>
Studies in 
Lviv
and its immediate environs have shown that the joint introduction of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
during landscaping is usually accompanied by the formation of colonies of the first species with greater phenotypic diversity. This may be due to the larger number of founding individuals. At sites where only 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. nemoralis
</tp:taxon-name>
was relatively recently introduced, the absence of some phenotypes and hereditary traits, which are less common in the study area, was more often observed. Also, a clearly pronounced predominance of any one variant of the shell colouration was more often noted there, most often pink unbanded or yellow mid-banded.
