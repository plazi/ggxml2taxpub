Introduction
</p>
         <p>
In Britain and Ireland, non-native (
sensu

) plants now constitute over half of the wild flora (

). Similarly, at least 75% of the naturalised flora globally is thought to have escaped domestic gardens (

). There is also a continued increase in plant introductions (first record rate) globally (

, 

). This is projected to result in an increase in the number of naturalised species particularly in Europe (

). Although the main introduction pathway or source of invasive species globally is ornamental horticulture (

; 

; 

; 

; 

), only a relatively small number have so far become invasive (

). Invasive species threaten native biodiversity (

) and/or have economic, human health, or quality of life impacts (

) and have cost the UK economy between £5.4 and £13.7 billion since 1976 (

). Garden ornamentals (

) confined to gardens and those which have already naturalised, but not yet shown to be invasive, represent a 
'pool'
of species with invasive potential - 'future 
invaders'
sensu

- or an invasion debt (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Despite the risks of invasive species and future invaders, ornamental horticulture brings with it many benefits such as to human health (e.g. 

) and by providing ecosystem services (e.g. 

, 

). The ornamental horticulture and landscaping industry also contributed (e.g. through retail and production of ornamentals) £28.8 billion to UK GDP in 2019 with a potential increase to £41.8 billion by 2030 (

).
</p>
         <p>Hence, identifying and preventing future invaders before they escape gardens is critical, both ecologically and economically, and gardeners may have a key role in this. Here we explore whether surveying gardeners can be a suitable approach to prioritising future invaders.</p>
         <p>How do ornamentals escape, and become invasive?</p>
         <p>
Numerous frameworks have been developed to better understand why certain species become invasive and to improve links between invasion science, policy and management (

). One example is the Unified Framework for Biological Invasions (

), referred to here as the 'unified 
framework'
. This combines the concepts of stages (

; 

) and barriers (

) in invasion science (

). Barriers can be described as limiting factors that restrict a species from 
'succeeding'
to the next stage. The unified framework is arguably the most applicable framework for ornamental horticulture because it recognises human-imposed cultivation barriers (e.g. garden fences) between introduction and naturalisation. 

recognise that it is possible for species to 
'skip'
this barrier if introduced directly into the wild unintentionally. However, there is no recognition that this barrier can also be 
'skipped'
due to intentional introduction into the wild 
sensu

. Note that the unified framework of 

does not incorporate the impact of an invasive species. The stages of the invasion process are not independent of each other. For example, 

found that an early first record in the wild was one of the factors increasing the likelihood of a non-native plant transitioning from being a casual to being naturalised. One factor important in this specific context of ornamental horticulture is hybridisation which can increase the invasive potential of ornamentals and is linked with climate change (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>Can gardeners identify potentially invasive ornamentals?</p>
         <p>
Gardeners have a crucial role in reducing the risks associated with invasive species, including at a practical level, for example through their choice of ornamentals to grow and steps to adopt while gardening to limit the spread of invasive species into the wild (

). Gardeners also have a role in identifying ornamentals with invasive potential because they often have expert knowledge (

) of how different ornamentals are performing in their garden including those showing 'invasive 
behaviour'
. This expert knowledge can help identify a potentially invasive species early (e.g. before escaping gardens) which is both ecologically and economically advantageous (

) as it allows for prevention as a management approach. It is also important to prioritise species for control (

; 

). For ornamentals, this means identifying which of the around 70,000 plants available for gardeners (

) have invasive potential, before escaping from gardens. There are also many non-native (
sensu

) ornamentals which are not currently invasive (

) but are beyond the scope of horizon scanning because they are already present in the wild (

) either as: i) casuals: plants surviving in the wild (i.e. outside of cultivation) due to repeated introductions; ii) survivors: plants that are persistent in an area simply due to longevity but do not reproduce; or iii) having naturalised (syn. established): a plant which is self-reproducing or increasing year-to-year by sexual or vegetative means (

). This leaves a gap - as identified by 

- in the identification of potentially invasive ornamentals. This gap can be addressed by looking at 
'non-invasiveness'
to determine green lists (

) or engaging with gardeners to identify potentially invasive ornamentals. The latter is the focus of this study.
</p>
         <p>

tested a citizen science approach using an online survey to identify potentially invasive ornamentals (

) and reported the naturalisation status of 121 species (including 17 native species). Eight species were not known to have escaped gardens, i.e., with no naturalised records in Britain at the time of their study. Since the 

study, a long-term citizen science project called Plant Alert has been launched - led by the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI) and Coventry University - to monitor potentially invasive ornamentals, asking gardeners to record invasive plants in their garden (

). Such data can be used, for example, in risk assessments and for advising gardeners (

). A survey can also act as an educational mechanism for gardeners (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
The challenge is identifying which ornamentals could become invasive in the future, not just naturalisation status. An important aspect is therefore to also look at invasive status elsewhere in the world. In this study, we identify gardeners as the target audience for engagement to identifying future invaders, i.e., species invasive potential. This has great potential for achieving Target 6 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (

). A structured scheme for prioritising future invaders reported by gardeners is shown below (Fig. 
1
).
</p>
         <p>This structured scheme for prioritising can be adapted depending on data and geographic scale. See Methods section for list of data sources.</p>
         <p>We engaged with gardeners to address the research question: can gardeners identify future invaders? By doing so, we aimed to explore whether surveying gardeners can be a suitable approach to prioritising future invaders in Britain and Ireland.</p>

         <p>Methods</p>
         <p>
Two complementary surveys were designed and conducted, which differed in their method of participation, but had the same target audience (

; 

) of gardeners (amateur or professionals) in Britain and Ireland. Both surveys were hosted by Jisc Online Surveys (www.onlinesurveys.ac.uk) and passed ethical review prior to implementation. Neither survey offered a comprehensive explanation of the term 
'invasive'
to participants because: 1) doing so might not match how gardeners use the term in their gardens, see 

; and 2) the purpose of the study was not to ask gardeners what ornamentals are having an impact in the wild (as invasive species 
sensu stricto
) but rather those showing 'invasive 
behaviour'
in gardens.
</p>
         <p>Scoping survey</p>
         <p>
A scoping survey asked gardeners to: ' 

list up to three ornamental plants 
you've
noticed invading/taking over your garden

'. Participants could report up to three plants (the first being the most invasive) and the first part of their postcode (UK) or Eircode in Ireland meaning no personal data was collected. See Suppl. material 1. The survey was launched in August 2018 using the 
RHS's
social media Twitter account (@The_RHS with 159,000 followers at the time). It was also publicised elsewhere including the November issue of The Garden (

), with a circulation of over 510,000 (

), and The Hardy Plant 
Society's
Newsletter and the 
RHS's
December email circulation, reaching 183,306 RHS members. Targeting existing gardening groups such as this can be effective (

) in recruiting participants through non-probability convenience sampling (

; 

). The scoping survey closed on May 19th 2019.
</p>
         <p>Chelsea survey</p>
         <p>The scoping survey informed a follow-up survey (henceforth the Chelsea survey) which was launched at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show (RHS Chelsea) in London May 20th-25th 2019. The Chelsea survey was tested with potential participants beforehand, using regular gardening volunteers from the Friends of the Harris Garden, at the University of Reading. Minor improvements were made to the survey as a result. The Chelsea survey was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Biological Sciences at the University (reference number SBS18-19 36).</p>
         <p>
Relevant to this study is the question: ' 
what is the main ornamental plant you have noticed invading or taking over your garden
?'. This was a drop-down question consisting of the ten most reported ornamentals (based on preliminary analysis) in the scoping survey. Four of the drop-down options were for genera only which then prompted an additional question asking the participant if they could specify which species and/or cultivar. Participants could also select 
'other'
to report a different ornamental. See Suppl. material 1. The question could be repeated up to two times. Visitors at Chelsea who had indicated that they wished to participate at a later date were emailed with a direct link. The Chelsea survey closed in December 2019.
</p>
         <p>Data cleaning</p>
         <p>
To ensure participants of both surveys were from Britain or Ireland, the postcodes or Eircodes were geolocated using www.geocode.xyz. Responses which could not be geocoded were discarded. The plants reported in both surveys were then taxonomically standardised in three steps: 1) manually correcting spelling errors and giving scientific names to vernacular names. This was done through expert judgement and checking RHS references (

, 

; 

, 

). 'Japanese 
anemone'
sensu lato
is treated here as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Anemone 
x
hybrida
</tp:taxon-name>
Paxton. Any reports with a vernacular name which could not confidently be assigned a scientific name were discarded; 2) the scientific names were checked using the Global Names Resolver (gnr_resolve) function as part of the taxize package (

) in R version 4.0.4 (

). The data source was the International Plant Names Index (

). The nomenclature thus follows IPNI, except for infra-specific (including cultivars) and inter-specific taxa (hybrids); and 3) infra- and inter-specific examples checked against the aforementioned RHS references, but the nomenclature to species level still follows IPNI. The standardised list was checked for duplicates and reports which were only at genus level were removed, i.e. species, subspecies and varieties as well as hybrid taxa were retained and analysed as such (except for cultivars). Native taxa (

; 

, 

) as listed by 

, were also removed. Data cleaning resulted in 318 responses being discarded - including responses from the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland which could not be geolocated - out of the total 876 responses (562 in the scoping survey and 314 in the Chelsea survey).
</p>
         <p>Data analysis</p>
         <p>
Global and domestic invasive status (i.e. evidence of impact) was taken from the Country Compendium version 1.0 of the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) (

, 

). 

and The Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF) database (

; 

) were used for determining domestic status, including naturalisation. The point of the study is not to make a direct comparison with 

because the questions are different but both share the principle of identifying potentially invasive ornamentals. We have therefore added the respective number of reports via Plant Alert (

; 

) into Table 
1
for context with what has been done since the data of this study was collected. Species richness of reported species (

) and the completeness of the sampling strategy ("sample coverage", 

) were investigated using iNEXT (

, 

; 

). Briefly, the sampling-unit-based incidence data approach was used for interpolation and extrapolation, treating each gardener as the sampling unit, based on the 
gardener's
expert knowledge, and the identity of their reported species as incidence data. Here we assume that while every garden has a different size and overall combination of species, each gardener accurately assessed the identity of plants that were 
'invasive'
within their own garden. In this approach "sample coverage" is the proportion of overall species occurrences that can be attributed to identified taxa. For the purposes of these analyses: i) cultivars were not included; and ii) observations of varieties and subspecies for which the species was already present in the dataset were combined with the observations of their respective species.

The cleaned results for both surveys are presented here together with 847 reports from 558 gardeners (Fig. 
2
). The 847 reports included: 203 species, 8 infra-specific (4 subspecies and 4 varieties), and 13 hybrids, totalling 224 taxa. There were also 27 named cultivars resulting in 251 different taxa being reported.
</p>
         <p>
Based on the 221 unique species and hybrids (see Methods section) included in the overall dataset, interpolated species accumulation of reported taxa for the survey data did not approach an asymptote (Fig. 
3
). For observed data the estimated 95% CI of species richness was 203.83-238.17 species (Fig. 
3a, c
) and sample coverage (SC) was estimated at 0.849 (95% CI: 0.825-0.873) (Fig. 
3b, c
). This level of SC suggests that for every 6-8 additional gardeners, an additional taxon would be added (each additional gardener surveyed (beyond 558) would add an additional 0.127-0.175 species to the total). Extrapolation to twice the number of survey responses (Fig. 
3
) gives an estimated 95% CI for species richness of 291.04-353.72 and SC = 0.907 (95% CI: 0.883-0.931).

         <p>
Citizen science has great potential to improve our understanding of invasive species (

) especially in identifying invasive potential (e.g. 

). It also has the added benefit of being an opportunity for public engagement and science communication, informing participants about issues (

; 

) such as invasive species (

). The focus here is on a citizen science approach to identify future invaders.
</p>
         <p>Shortlist of future invaders</p>
         <p>
Ornamentals reported by ≥ 5 gardeners (Table 
1
) are prioritised here to generate a shortlist. None of the taxa in Table 
1
were included in the green list of 

. Although Table 
1
does not include any species not known to have escaped gardens in GB or Ireland (

), it does include two survivors. One of which, 
<tp:taxon-name>

Anemone 
x
hybrida

</tp:taxon-name>
, was the most reported but it has no invasive status globally (

). It was also the joint most frequently reported in 

with six reports, although reported in their study as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Anemone scabiosa
</tp:taxon-name>
H.
Lev
. &amp; Vaniot.
</p>
         <p>
Of the reported taxa which have already escaped gardens in GB and/or Ireland but are not yet invasive (Table 
1
) it is important to focus on those with an invasive status globally (

) as shown in Fig. 
1
. This gives a shortlist of nine ornamentals: 
<tp:taxon-name>Arum italicum subsp. italicum</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Erigeron karvinskianus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>Lamium galeobdolon subsp. argentatum</tp:taxon-name>

. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Symphyotrichum novi-belgii
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Verbena bonariensis
</tp:taxon-name>
. It is also worth noting, that of the reported plants (Table 
1
) considered invasive, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Crocosmia 
x
crocosmiiflora
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hyacinthoides hispanica
</tp:taxon-name>
were the most frequently reported in 

with six reports each (jointly with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Anemone scabiosa
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>L. galeobdolon subsp. argentatum</tp:taxon-name>
). Of the shortlisted ornamentals, the following are also listed as the most frequently reported via 

as of November 18th 2023: 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. karvinskianus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. cordata
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>L. galeobdolon subsp. argentatum</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. bonariensis
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
One problem with prioritising is the differences in status between data sources. For example, as is the case with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Fallopia baldschuanica
</tp:taxon-name>
(Table 
1
) and 
<tp:taxon-name>Lamium galeobdolon subsp. argentatum</tp:taxon-name>
is arguably already invasive and is listed in Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act which applies in Great Britain. Critically, none of the shortlisted taxa or those listed in Table 
1
- except for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Akebia quinata
</tp:taxon-name>
- were identified during the most recent horizon scanning process for GB because they were beyond the scope of the exercise; e.g. they were already present in the wild (

). The approach here is therefore effective in addressing the gap in the identification of potentially invasive ornamentals.
</p>
         <p>
Based on the trajectory of the species accumulation in the survey data (Fig. 
3
) we suggest that there may be a significant number of additional future invaders that were not reported. This trend, shown in Fig. 
3
, is similar to that found by 

(albeit of quadrant data not from a survey). Extrapolation from our data suggests that the number of reported species could increase by approximately 1 for every additional 5-8 gardeners surveyed. Very tentatively, the species accumulation curve appears to approach an asymptote at 350-400 species. However, this estimation requires caution as we note it may be a consequence of limiting the total number of species recorded by each gardener to a maximum of three. This necessarily increases the number of observations required to reach sampling saturation (SC = 1). For more accurate estimation in future surveys, we recommend allowing the observer to enter as many species as they wish (as is now the case with Plant Alert).
</p>
         <p>Native ornamentals</p>
         <p>
Native species were removed because they cannot be considered invasive 
sensu stricto.
However, there were 169 reports of native species with the most reported species being: 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hedera helix
</tp:taxon-name>
L. [n = 24], 
<tp:taxon-name>
Carex pendula
</tp:taxon-name>
Huds. [n = 22], and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Convallaria majalis
</tp:taxon-name>
L. [n = 10]. This is also a factor with Plant Alert, e.g. with nine reports of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. pendula
</tp:taxon-name>
as of November 18th 2019 (

). This raises two important points: 1) the idea of 'cryptic 
invasions'
; and 2) how gardeners understand the term 
'invasive'
. Firstly, cryptic invasions (

) have an impact on native genetic diversity (see 

) with an increasing number of hybrids recorded in Britain and Ireland (

) and due to the introduction of non-native genotypes. For example, six different cultivars of native species were reported including 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hedera helix
</tp:taxon-name>
'Ivalace'
[n = 1]. Secondly, the reports of native species suggest gardeners conflate the term 
'invasive'
with garden weeds and 
'thugs'
(

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. pendula
</tp:taxon-name>
is a good example of being native but widely considered a weed or 
'thug'
in gardens (e.g. 

), and is even described in 

, 468) as an " 
invasive native
". Conversely, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Geranium nodosum
</tp:taxon-name>
(Table 
1
) has no invasive status globally (

) but could be considered by many gardeners to be a weed. This possible conflation of terms has implications for this approach (see below).
</p>
         <p>Limitations and improving the approach</p>
         <p>

found two limitations to their approach: 1) difficulty with identification skills (see also 

); and 2) motivation of participants. Our study differs from that of 

by targeting gardeners rather than botanists. Their argument was that botanists (mainly members of the Botanical Society for Britain and Ireland) would have better identification skills, but gardeners are arguably more familiar with ornamentals grown in gardens. Furthermore, it is estimated that there are 30 million gardeners in Britain (

), compared to around 3,400 members of the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (

), which is a much better opportunity for recruiting participants. This study suggests gardeners are very interested in the issue of invasive species and their role in identifying future invaders. The main limitation in surveys appears to be in the distinction between an invasive - or potentially invasive - species and garden weeds or 
'thugs'
; specifically in how gardeners understand the term 
'invasive'
(

). This should therefore be explicitly explained before asking gardeners to report future invaders such as by providing a definition or multiple-choice question. An additional consideration is that, thanks to the efforts of gardeners, garden ornamentals often grow outside the core niche of their native distribution (

). Hence, species that are thriving inside gardens, and potentially taking over these highly managed spaces, may not be as successful in the wild. Also, there is a degree of uncertainty when asking gardeners to report through a survey due to challenges in identification. For example, bluebells grown in gardens are likely to be 
<tp:taxon-name>

Hyacinthoides 
x
massartiana

</tp:taxon-name>
Geerinck rather than 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. hispanica
</tp:taxon-name>
(

) with the latter being uncommon in gardens and rarely escape into the wild (

). However, gardeners often refer to them as 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. hispanica
</tp:taxon-name>
or by using the vernacular name 'Spanish 
bluebell'
. There can also be nomenclature problems such as with the vernacular name 'Japanese 
anemone'
which is applied to several scientific names including 
<tp:taxon-name>
Anemone hupehensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(Lemoine) Lemoine and 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. 
x
hybrida
</tp:taxon-name>
(

), and under ' 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. scabiosa
</tp:taxon-name>
' (

). Using a drop-down question which searches for a taxon (as is the case now with Plant Alert) does not necessarily address these challenges because it still relies on gardeners identifying the correct taxon in their report. It does, however, reduce the number of reports being discarded through data cleaning.
</p>
         <p>
This approach, if improved as suggested above and by allowing gardeners to report as many species as they wish, could be adopted as a form of horizon scanning for identifying future invaders even if it is not looking at 'door 
knocker'
species (

). This gives the opportunity to prioritise the approximately 70,000 ornamentals (

) available for sale in the UK. This could also be extended beyond individual gardeners as the target audience (as in this study) to better engage with a wider range of gardeners and landscapers, such as those working in public or botanic gardens and in residential areas. This would build on work already done in the Czech Republic (

, 

), which could be replicated in Britain and Ireland, to ensure selection of ornamentals do not include future invaders. Central to the approach is the structured scheme for prioritising future invaders (Fig. 
1
). This is also important for deciding which taxa need the invasive potential to be measured; for example, by adopting a species distribution modelling and/or trait-based approach (e.g. 

). This would result in both identifying future invaders and measuring their invasive potential.

         <title>N/A</title>
         <p>Conclusion</p>
         <p>
Identifying future invaders before they can become invasive in the wild is an important yet challenging issue for invasion science. Gardeners have a crucial role here in being the 'first 
contact'
for reporting ornamentals with invasive potential because ornamental horticulture is a main introduction pathway or source of invasive species globally. By addressing the research question of this study we have shown that data collected by gardeners can be used in a simple yet structured approach with the scheme for prioritising future invaders. This structured scheme is applied here to prioritise species in need of further analysis, such as a risk assessment, and has resulted in a shortlist of nine ornamentals of concern. Importantly, the shortlisted taxa were not identified as potentially invasive through horizon scanning. Furthermore, the approach has considerable potential for increasing awareness of invasive and potentially invasive ornamentals through engagement with gardeners by notifying them of the ornamentals of concern. This positive feedback loop between gardeners and invasion scientists could help reduce the risk of more ornamentals becoming invasive in the future.
