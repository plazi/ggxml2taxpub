         <p>Water mites (Acariformes: Hydrachnidia) are one of the planet’s most diverse and abundant groups of aquatic arthropods. With more than 7,500 described species, water</p>
         <p>mites have been documented in nearly every known freshwater environment. In lotic</p>
         <p>systems, water mites are commonly found in fast-flowing, riffle-run stream habitats, where</p>
         <p>one square meter of substrate can contain as many as 5,000 individual mites representing</p>
         <p>more than 50 species, 30 genera, and all 8 superfamilies. Despite their widespread distribution, relative diversity, and abundance, water mites have been widely neglected freshwater biomonitoring efforts. However, several studies across the globe have found</p>
         <p>in</p>
         <p>that water mites can be used as successful bioindicators of water quality conditions. Thus</p>
         <p>,</p>
         <p>
the following study provides one of the first detailed examinations of lotic water mites and their bioindicator potential in North America. We sampled water mites from sites along ”attaining” (unpolluted) and agriculturally ”impaired” (polluted) riffle-run stream habitats and compared their assemblages to other physicochemical and benthic macroinvertebrate metrics used to quantify water quality in 
Pennsylvania
. In total, we collected 9,139 individual water mites representing 5 superfamilies, 9 families, and 14 genera from both attaining (n = 13) and impaired (n = 13) streams. Similar to other global studies, we found significant differences between the water mite assemblages of attaining and impaired streams, with attaining streams having greater richness and diversity of water mites. Our
</p>
         <p>data shows that several mite taxa are associated with biological and physicochemical conditions of water quality, where some known sensitive taxa are increasingly dominant</p>
         <p>in attaining streams and less dominant in impaired streams. Conversely, some pollution-tolerant taxa dominance increases in impaired streams while sensitive taxa abundance declines. These findings illustrate that water mites vary in their sensitivity to pollution</p>
         <p>and are suitable bioindicator species whose inclusion in biomonitoring assessments will</p>
         <p>increase assessment accuracy.</p>

Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Freshwater environments are one of the most ecologically and economically important ecosystems in the world. Unfortunately, anthropogenic activities (e.g., agriculture, logging, and development) can significantly alter freshwater quality making them one of the most impaired ecosystems (

; 

). In the 
United States
alone, roughly 50% of all surveyed streams and rivers (~1.1 million km) are degraded to the point of being classified as “impaired” for failing to meet water quality standards (

). Thus, biologists from state and national agencies continuously monitor pollutants
</p>
         <p>in streams and rivers, allowing natural resource managers to mitigate problems when they arise</p>
         <p>promptly.</p>
         <p>One of the most common methods for assessing water quality involves measuring a</p>
         <p>waterways physical and chemical (i.e., physicochemical) attributes. While physicochemical</p>
         <p>data are important and can provide insights into pollution events and sources, long-term data</p>
         <p>are needed to fully understand water quality conditions. However, this monitoring requires</p>
         <p>
high-frequency sampling that can be time-consuming and expensive (

).
</p>
         <p>Without long-term physicochemical data, determining water quality can be challenging as</p>
         <p>
individual water samples only reflect conditions at the time of collection (

).
</p>
         <p>Additionally, many abiotic factors such as season, weather, flow events, and time the sample</p>
         <p>was collected can influence physicochemical conditions yearly, monthly, daily, or even hourly.</p>
         <p>To combat this temporal limitation of water quality data, scientists can incorporate biological</p>
         <p>water quality monitoring, or “biomonitoring,” into water quality assessments to account for this</p>
         <p>variability, as biological communities can reflect cumulative effects of physical and chemical</p>
         <p>
stressors within an aquatic environment (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>Benthic macroinvertebrates are commonly assessed in biomonitoring strategies over</p>
         <p>other aquatic organisms (e.g., fish and periphyton) due to their relative abundance in aquatic</p>
         <p>
systems, sessile lifestyle, and ease of collection and identification (

;
</p>
         <p>

). In fact, many state and national policies encourage the use of benthic
</p>
         <p>macroinvertebrates in biomonitoring strategies to inform and guide freshwater management</p>
         <p>
and protection decisions (

, 

; 

; 

</p>
         <p>
et al.
2009). By examining abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages at
</p>
         <p>various taxonomic levels (e.g., family, genus, or species), scientists can calculate metrics,</p>
         <p>such as the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), to discern unpolluted “attaining” and polluted</p>
         <p>
“impaired” water quality conditions (

; 

). In
</p>
         <p>
Pennsylvania
, the Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) calculates IBI scores
</p>
         <p>by combining six standardized community composition metrics into one score that ranges</p>
         <p>
from 0–100, where greater values indicate better water quality (

).
</p>
         <p>While calculating IBI scores are standard practice and account for most aquatic invertebrates,</p>
         <p>some taxa are not included in these scores. For instance, water mites are widely neglected in</p>
         <p>global freshwater biomonitoring strategies (Goldschmidt 2016). In fact, in most biomonitoring</p>
         <p>
protocols, including Pennsylvania’s (

), water mites are either ignored entirely
</p>
         <p>or identified collectively as “Hydracarina” or “Hydrachnidia,” an artificial grouping of several</p>
         <p>
water mite superfamilies (Goldschmidt 2016; 

).
</p>
         <p>However, water mites are one of the world’s most diverse and abundant groups of benthic</p>
         <p>macroinvertebrates, with over 7,500 described species representing more than 400 genera, 56</p>
         <p>families, and 7 superfamilies. Acarologists conservatively estimate that another 4,000 species</p>
         <p>
have yet to be discovered (

; 

). Water mites occur worldwide,
</p>
         <p>
except in 
Antarctica
, and can be found in nearly every known lentic and lotic freshwater
</p>
         <p>
environment (

). In lotic systems, water mites are commonly found in
</p>
         <p>fast-flowing, riffle-run stream habitats, which are often targeted for standard biomonitoring</p>
         <p>assessments, where a single square meter of substrate can contain as many as 5,000 individual</p>
         <p>
mites representing more than 50 species, 30 genera, and all 7 superfamilies (

;
</p>
         <p>

). In addition, water mites exhibit complex life cycles that are closely
</p>
         <p>connected with benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages as their larvae parasitize various aquatic</p>
         <p>
invertebrates, while deutonymphs and adults are predators (

; 

</p>
         <p>
al.
2010).
</p>
         <p>Due to these characteristics, the relationship between water mites and water quality dates</p>
         <p>
back to the early 20 
th
century, originating in Europe (

). Since then, several
</p>
         <p>studies across the globe have determined that water mites can be useful bioindicators of water</p>
         <p>
quality, including in 
Australia
(

), 
Bhutan
(

), 
Costa Rica
</p>
         <p>
(

), 
Germany
(

), 
Italy
(

;
</p>
         <p>

), 
Panama
(

), 
Poland
(Zawal 
et al.
2017), 
Romania
</p>
         <p>
(

), and the 
United States
(

). Despite this evidence, water
</p>
         <p>mites continue to be neglected in global freshwater biomonitoring strategies (Goldschmidt</p>
         <p>2016). In addition, the group “Hydracarina” is generally considered tolerant to high levels of</p>
         <p>pollution. By making this assumption, scientists fail to account for a diverse group of benthic</p>
         <p>macroinvertebrates whose inclusion in bioassessments could provide further information on</p>
         <p>water quality.</p>
         <p>
The Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania
, 
U.S.A.
, contains nearly 
86,000 miles
of freshwater
</p>
         <p>streams, with approximately one-third of these streams listed as “impaired” and considered too</p>
         <p>
polluted to support aquatic life, clean drinking water, or safe recreational activities (

</p>
         <p>2022). In addition, there has been relatively little work done on water mites within the state</p>
         <p>
and few systematic collection efforts (
Table 1
). 
Pennsylvania
, therefore, provides a great
</p>
         <p>opportunity to examine whether water mites, like other groups of benthic macroinvertebrates,</p>
         <p>can be used to differentiate streams with varying water quality conditions.</p>
         <p>This study aimed to improve our understanding of lotic water mites and their utility as</p>
         <p>water-quality bioindicators. While our data represents a relatively limited region, our results</p>
         <p>
are likely translatable to much of the eastern 
United States
. This effort is, in part, a response
</p>
         <p>to the call for collaboration on furthering knowledge in this field (Goldschmidt 2016). We</p>
         <p>examined water mites from high-quality, cold-water streams with known “attaining” (meets</p>
         <p>water quality standards) and “impaired” (fails to meet one or more water quality standards)</p>
         <p>
conditions (

). In addition, we performed PADEP benthic macroinvertebrate and
</p>
         <p>physicochemical water quality assessments to confirm each stream’s pollution status and for</p>
         <p>further comparison to the water mite assemblages. The objectives of this study were to: 1)</p>
         <p>identify and inventory water mite taxa from cold-water, riffle-run stream habitats, 2) determine</p>
         <p>if water mite assemblages vary across attaining and impaired streams, and 3) determine how</p>
         <p>biological and physicochemical conditions influence water mite assemblages.</p>

Methods
</title>
         <p>
Site selection
</p>
         <p>
We considered four factors when selecting sites: 1) geographic distribution, 2) designated use, 3) pollution status (attaining or impaired), and 4) access. In total, 26 sites were selected from a four-county region in central 
Pennsylvania
, 
U.S.
A (
Figure 1
, 
Table 2
). All sites are within the Susquehanna River Basin, Pennsylvania’s largest watershed that has also been scrutinized for
</p>
         <p>
its pollution contribution in the Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the 
United States
(e.g., Goldberg 
et al.
1978; 

; 

). Sites are distributed across
</p>
         <p>
12 different HUC-12 subwatersheds (

). In addition, all sites were along streams designated by PADEP as high-quality, cold-water fishery (HQ-CWF) streams. Only 30% of Pennsylvania’s streams are designated as HQ-CWF as these streams are the “best of the best” and, therefore, receive some of the highest levels of protection, such as narrower impairment thresholds (

).
</p>
         <p>
We initially selected a total of 15 attaining and 11 impaired sites after reviewing the 
Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection’s 2020 Integrated Water Quality Report (

; 
Figures 2
and 
3
). To ensure impaired streams were comparable, we only selected streams designated with agriculture as the impairment source for this study. Upon completing this study’s benthic macroinvertebrate assessments (see details below), we determined that
</p>
         <p>13 of the 15 attaining sites met water quality standards; however, two sites did not and were redesignated as impaired for this study (see Results below). Therefore, our study compared water mite communities between 13 attaining and 13 impaired streams.</p>
         <p>When selecting sites, we also took accessibility into account. Therefore, to the best of our ability, we selected publicly accessible sites or, when necessary, acquired landowner permission prior to any sampling efforts.</p>
         <p>
Water Mite Collection
</p>
         <p>
For this study, we collected water mites at 23 sites in 2021 and 3 additional sites in 2022, between 1 August and 31 August, when water mites are typically most abundant (

; 

; 

). We collected water mites using a quantitative protocol for
</p>
         <p>
lotic, riffle-run habitats (

). We developed this collection protocol
</p>
         <p>
by modifying qualitative collection methods proposed (

) and incorporating benthic macroinvertebrate collection standardizations from the Wadeable Riffle-Run Stream Macroinvertebrate Data Collection Protocol (

). Briefly, at each of our sampling sites, we first delineated a 100-meter reach. Within our reach, we used a spade foot shovel and a 250 µm mesh non-truncated D-frame net, disturbing four one-square meter substrate areas within riffle-run habitats. The contents from all four collections were then composited
</p>
         <p>
into one large plastic sampling container. We then rinsed and sieved the composite sample using stream water and a 
3 mm
sieve stacked on top of a 250 µm sieve ten times. We then used a spoon to collect the contents from the 250 µm sieve, transferred it into a labeled 50 mL sampling container, and filled it with stream water. The samples were then returned to the lab in a cooler, transferred into a white sorting tray, and allowed to sit undisturbed for 20-30 minutes. We then collected mites using a pipette and transferred them into a 4-dram glass vial. After six hours of collecting mites, we removed excess water from the 4-dram glass vial and preserved the mites in 80% ethanol until identification. We identified all mites (except Oribatids) to genus using keys (

and 

). We then preserved all collected specimens in 70 – 80% ethanol and accessioned them in the Frost Entomological Museum at the 
Pennsylvania State
University in State College, PA, 
U.S.A.
We collected
</p>
         <p>
all water mites and benthic macroinvertebrate samples under

Type
I Scientific Collector Permit Numbers 2021–01–0017 and 2022–01–0147.
</p>
         <p>
Environmental Variables
</p>
         <p>
We collected physicochemical and biological data at each sample site to 1) confirm each site’s “attaining” or “impaired” status, and 2) for use in multivariate analyses with water mite assemblages. All physicochemical and biological sampling and assessment methodologies adhered to PADEP standards (

; 

).

         <p>We completed physicochemical assessments in conjunction with each water mite sampling</p>
         <p>effort involving water chemistry and physical habitat measurements. We used a Yellow Springs</p>
         <p>Instrument (YSI) ProPlus 2030 multi-meter to measure water temperature (°C), specific</p>
         <p>conductance (µS/cm), and dissolved oxygen parameters (mg/L and%DO). We used a YSI</p>
         <p>pH100 Ecosense meter to measure temperature (°C) and pH standard units. We compared</p>
         <p>temperature readings for each instrument at each site to ensure meter accuracy.</p>
         <p>Physical habitat assessments involve ranking 12 individual habitat parameters over a 100-</p>
         <p>meter sample reach as poor (1-5), marginal (6-10), suboptimal (11-15), and optimal (16-20) by</p>
         <p>
assigning each parameter a value ranging from 1-20 (

). These parameters include
</p>
         <p>instream cover, epifaunal substrate, embeddedness, velocity/depth regimes, channel alteration,</p>
         <p>sediment deposition, riffle frequency, channel flow status, condition of banks, bank vegetative</p>
         <p>protection, grazing or other disruptive pressure, and riparian vegetative zone. After all the</p>
         <p>parameters were evaluated, scores were combined to calculate a Total Habitat Score and rated</p>
         <p>as follows: poor (0–60), marginal (61–120), suboptimal (121–180), and optimal (181–240).</p>
         <p>In addition to water chemistry and physical habitat data, we also recorded land use data using</p>
         <p>
publicly available online software Model My Watershed (

).
</p>
         <p>For each sample site, we determined land use by delineating the upstream drainage area (km²).</p>
         <p>For this study, we combined several land use attributes to form three primary categories, 1)</p>
         <p>Forest (combined deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forest attributes), 2) Agriculture (combined</p>
         <p>pasture/hay and cropland attributes), and 3) Urban/Developed Space (combined developed-</p>
         <p>open space, developed low intensity, developed medium intensity, and developed-high intensity</p>
         <p>attributes). Since these three primary categories composed more than 97% of the drainage</p>
         <p>area’s land use, we did not include the remaining land use attributes (e.g., open water, perennial</p>
         <p>ice/snow, woody wetlands) in our analyses.</p>
         <p>
Biological Variables
</p>
         <p>Unlike water chemistry and physical habitat, which were measured the same day as the water</p>
         <p>mite collections, benthic macroinvertebrate samples were collected at each site between 1</p>
         <p>March and 31 May in both 2021 and 2022 following PADEP protocols for wadeable, riffle-run</p>
         <p>
streams (

). Benthic macroinvertebrate communities reflect the cumulative
</p>
         <p>
effects of environmental stressors over long durations (

; 

</p>
         <p>2016); therefore, these data represent each stream’s annual water quality conditions.</p>
         <p>After benthic macroinvertebrates were collected and subsampled, we used an Olympus</p>
         <p>SZ61 stereomicroscope (0.67 – 4.5 magnification) and identified all individuals to the genus</p>
         <p>
level, except for those taxonomic groups listed in

</p>
         <p>We calculated six metrics (total taxa richness, EPT richness, Beck’s index, Hilsenhoff</p>
         <p>biotic index, Shannon diversity, and percent sensitive individuals) using each site’s identified</p>
         <p>benthic macroinvertebrate samples. To compare metric scores among different sample sites,</p>
         <p>each metric was standardized based on drainage area size to a value between 0–100. We then</p>
         <p>averaged the standardized scores of the six metrics to produce the final freestone index of</p>
         <p>Biological Integrity (IBI) score. As per PADEP standards for HQ-CWF streams, we considered</p>
         <p>all sites with an IBI score of less than 63 impaired and all sites with an IBI score greater</p>
         <p>than or equal to 63 attaining. A detailed description of each metric, calculation formula, and</p>
         <p>
standardization process is available (

). We performed all metric calculations in
</p>
         <p>Microsoft Excel (Version 2301).</p>
         <p>
Data Analyses
</p>
         <p>
For each site, we calculated water mite abundance (sum of all individuals per site), richness (count of individual taxa per site), and Shannon Diversity Index, a community composition metric that incorporates both richness and evenness across a biological sample (

).
</p>
         <p>
For comparability, we used the same Shannon Diversity calculation formula described for benthic macroinvertebrate assessments (

). We used an independent two-way t-test to compare these water mite community metrics between attaining and impaired streams. We transformed abundance and richness counts to normal distributions by calculating the natural log for each metric prior to performing each t-test.
</p>
         <p>Due to issues with collinearity among environmental variables (e.g., benthic macroinvertebrate metrics were significantly correlated with habitat scores), it was difficult to complete multivariate analyses utilizing all measured environmental variables. Therefore, we completed individual Pearson’s correlation tests to compare the individual strength of relationships between each environmental variable and water mite abundance, richness, and Shannon Diversity Index.</p>
         <p>We performed a multivariate Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) using the to assess water mite assemblages at the generic level for both generic abundance (sum of all individuals per genera per site) and generic composition (sum of all individuals per genus per site/sum</p>
         <p>of all individual water mites per site) to compare these assemblages to several environmental variables. In the CCA analysis, we included the environmental variables IBI, Total Habitat Score, agricultural land use, specific conductivity, and drainage area for comparison to the water mite assemblage. Specifically, we performed a variance inflation test (VIF) prior to the CCA ordination to determine the amount of collinearity among these environmental variables. We included all variables that had a VIF less than 10 for the multivariate analysis. Since</p>
         <p>
the biological and habitat metrics were collinear, we selected IBI and Total Habitat Score as representative metrics for all the biological and habitat data, respectively. In the CCA, we also included specific conductivity because it was the chemical parameter with the most significant relationship with the water mite communities (see Results). Agricultural land use parameters were also included because it is considered the primary source of pollution for the impaired stream. Additionally, while drainage area was not correlated with the water mite community metrics, 
Pennsylvania
biologists consider it an important factor when assessing streams and rivers (

). We removed the mite genera

, 
<tp:taxon-name>Woolastookia</tp:taxon-name>
,

and 
<tp:taxon-name>Oribatida</tp:taxon-name>
from the multivariate analysis because the recorded specimens represented less than 5% of all water mites collected. Finally, we removed the Gregory Run sample (impaired) since no water mites were collected. We performed all statistical tests in RStudio Version 
1.4.1717
using the package vegan version 2.6-4. We considered alpha values less than 0.05 significant.

Water mite presence and distribution
</p>
         <p>We collected and identified 9,139 water mites representing 14 genera, 9 families, and 5</p>
         <p>

In addition to true water mites, we collected 
two specimens

<tp:taxon-name>Oribatida</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
Only 
33 specimens
(0.4% of all collected mites) were considered unidentifiable and not included
</p>
         <p>in the analysis. Some of these specimens may be able to be identified further through slide</p>
         <p>mounting and examination under higher magnification.</p>
         <p>
Environmental Variables
</p>
         <p>We collected and identified 5,332 individual benthic macroinvertebrates across all study sites from 2021 and 2022. In total, this included 94 distinct taxa from 4 phyla, 7 classes, 17 orders,</p>
         <p>
54 families, and 83 genera (
Table 5
).
</p>
         <p>Attaining and impaired streams showed distinct differences between their biological and physical habitat attributes, with healthier streams often recording greater scores (Table</p>
         <p>6). On average, attaining streams had higher levels of dissolved oxygen and forested land use, while impaired streams had higher levels of specific conductivity, and agricultural and urban/developed land use.</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>
Water mite relationships with environmental variables
</p>
         <p>Independent two-way t-tests revealed significant differences between water mite richness in attaining and impaired streams (t = -2.4298, df = 24, p-value = 0.02296) and Shannon Diversity</p>
         <p>(t = -2.5093, df = 24, p-value = 0.01925) with attaining streams harboring greater diversity than impaired streams. Water mite abundance was not significantly different between attaining and impaired streams (t = -0.89302, df = 24, p-value = 0.3807).</p>
         <p>
Pearson’s correlation tests between the environmental variables and water mite assemblage metrics revealed several significant correlations (
Table 7
). Water mite abundance was not significantly correlated with any environmental variables; however, richness and Shannon Diversity exhibited moderate to strong correlations with nearly all biological metrics, habitat parameters, and several chemical and land use parameters. Specifically, water mite richness showed the strongest, positive correlation with macroinvertebrate total taxa richness (R = 0.80,
</p>
         <p>
p &lt;0.01) and Shannon Diversity (R = 0.80, p &lt;0.01). The strongest negative correlation was found between water mite richness and agricultural land use (R = –0.61, p &lt;0.01), (
Figure 4
).
</p>
         <p>
Generic-level comparisons with environmental variables using CCA
</p>
         <p>
The environmental-constrained CCA ordinations showed distinct relationships between the water mite genera and selected environmental variables (
Figure 5
). Environmental variables explained 57.5% of total variation in generic abundance, with 32.4% on the first axis (CA1) and 25.1% on the second axis (CA2). Environmental variables explained 51.3% of the total variation
</p>
         <p>in generic composition, with 34.8% of the variation along the first axis (CA1) and 16.5% of the variation along the second axis (CA2). The canonical axes of the environmental variables and water mite assemblage were associated significantly with generic abundance (Pseudo F first axis = 10.9, p &lt;0.001; pseudo f all axis = 4.7, p &lt;0.001) and generic composition (Pseudo F</p>
         <p>first axis = 7.2, p &lt;0.001; pseudo f all axis = 2.7, p &lt;0.001).</p>

Discussion
</title>
         <p>We found that several water mite taxa became increasingly dominant in streams with increased water quality and are likely sensitive to pollution, showing that water-mite assemblages can</p>
         <p>pling efforts.</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>
differentiate between attaining and agriculturally impaired streams. Specifically, abundance and composition of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Monatractides
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ljania
</tp:taxon-name>
in streams appear to have been closely associated with greater IBI scores and Total Habitat Scores, indicating these taxa may be sensitive to pollution, since greater scores are often associated with higher water quality (

).
</p>
         <p>In contrast, we also found several taxa became increasingly dominant in streams with reduced water quality, similar to known shifts expected from other bioindicator species. For example,</p>
         <p>
the abundance and composition of 

<tp:taxon-name>Hygrobates</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Sperchonopsis</tp:taxon-name>
,

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Mideopsis
</tp:taxon-name>
increased in impaired streams with lower water quality, indicating these taxa may be tolerant of polluted conditions. While drainage area did not significantly correlate with metrics of water mite assemblages, drainage area did appear to influence abundance 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sperchon
</tp:taxon-name>
of, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Atractides
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Feltria
</tp:taxon-name>
, indicating these genera may prefer larger order streams rather than smaller headwater streams.
</p>
         <p>While water mite abundance did not correlate with water quality metrics, diversitybased indices, such as water mite richness and Shannon Diversity, correlated with many</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>
of the biological and habitat metrics currently used to assess streams and rivers throughout 
Pennsylvania
. Similar to benthic macroinvertebrate richness and diversity scores, water mite richness and Shannon Diversity increased at healthier sites and decreased at impaired sites. Similar findings have been reported globally (

; 

; 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Contrary to previous findings that found greater abundance in pristine streams (

), we found that total abundance was not significantly different between attaining and impaired sites. This increase in abundance in our impaired sites can be explained by the consistent increase in abundance of a pollution-tolerant taxa, such as 

<tp:taxon-name>Hygrobates</tp:taxon-name>
.

In attaining streams, we found greater evenness of mite taxa; however, as water quality declined and the pollution-sensitive taxa became less dominant, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hygrobates
</tp:taxon-name>
abundance proportionally compensated for the decline in pollution-sensitive taxa. For example, in several impaired streams, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hygrobates
</tp:taxon-name>
accounted for more than 80% of all collected water mites, while in attaining streams, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hygrobates
</tp:taxon-name>
never comprised more than 34% of total water mites abundance. Moreover, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hygrobates
</tp:taxon-name>
appears to become vastly more abundant in polluted waters here in the 
USA
, which is consistent with European studies that have found 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hygrobates
</tp:taxon-name>
to be one of the most pollution-tolerant water mite taxa (

; 

; Goldschmidt 2016). Some 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hygrobates
species
</tp:taxon-name>
are especially tolerant of organic pollution, which is common within agriculturally impaired streams due to increased manure and fertilizer

         <p>runoff from nearby pastures and cropland.</p>
         <p>
In addition to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hygrobates
</tp:taxon-name>
, we collected an unusually large number of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Torrenticola
</tp:taxon-name>
at two impaired sites in southern Huntingdon County, where abundance exceeded 1,200 and 1,300 individuals and composed 73% and 54% of their respective water mite samples. This finding does not correspond with previous studies, which determined that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Torrenticola
</tp:taxon-name>
is one of the
</p>
         <p>
more sensitive genera to pollution (

; 

). In addition to these
</p>
         <p>
two impaired sites, we documented 
<tp:taxon-name>
Torrenticola
</tp:taxon-name>
at three additional impaired sites where their abundance was 1, 2, and 65 individuals, composing less than 13% of their respective samples. Across our attaining sites, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Torrenticola
</tp:taxon-name>
were more common (10 out of 13 sites) and ranged in abundance (1–278 individuals) and sample composition (&lt;1–68%). In a detailed examination of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Torrenticola
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Costa Rica
, 28 of 42 
<tp:taxon-name>
Torrenticola
species
</tp:taxon-name>
were restricted to heavily shaded, unpolluted sites, while the remaining 14 species were collected in streams affected by urban and agricultural runoff (

). Three of these 14 species showed signs of high pollution tolerance, indicating that the species’ capacity to tolerate pollution varies. Therefore,
</p>
         <p>
we hypothesize that if we identified 
<tp:taxon-name>
Torrenticola
</tp:taxon-name>
(and perhaps other genera) to species, we
</p>
         <p>
would see different 
<tp:taxon-name>
Torrenticola
species
</tp:taxon-name>
inhabiting attaining and impaired streams.
</p>
         <p>While we showed differences between attaining and impaired streams, our study was</p>
         <p>limited to riffle-run microhabitats. Therefore, the water mite assemblages we characterized</p>
         <p>may not represent each stream’s overall water mite diversity. For example, previous studies</p>
         <p>found differences between assemblages of water mites from riffle and stream edge habitats</p>
         <p>
(

) and riffle and leaf-litter habitats (Goldschmidt 2016). These studies found that
</p>
         <p>stream edge habitats harbored the greatest abundance and diversity compared to riffle habitats</p>
         <p>
(

), and that water mite abundance and diversity were greater in riffles compared to
</p>
         <p>leaf-litter (Goldschmidt 2016). Therefore, we likely overlooked additional taxa that may have</p>
         <p>been present outside the riffle-run habitats.</p>
         <p>However, this oversight to sample multiple habitats does not alter the significance of our</p>
         <p>
findings. Our water mite collection methods were modified from qualitative protocols (

</p>
         <p>
et al.
2010) and incorporated PADEP macroinvertebrate sampling standardizations (

</p>
         <p>
2021a). These standardizations were derived from a seminal sampling approach (

</p>
         <p>
al.
1999) in which the collector samples macroinvertebrates from the “single, most productive
</p>
         <p>habitat” in a stream reach. In many cases, riffle-runs are considered the most productive habitat</p>
         <p>due to their stability, enriched oxygen levels, and lotic-erosional state, which increases substrate</p>
         <p>
availability and diversity (e.g., gravel, cobble, boulder; 

). In high-gradient
</p>
         <p>streams where cobble substrate is abundant, such as those sampled during this study, this</p>
         <p>sampling approach provides the most representative sample of the biological community as</p>
         <p>
macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity tend to be highest in riffle-run habitats (

</p>
         <p>
al.
1999).
</p>
         <p>While our results provide insights to the benefits of incorporating water mite diversity</p>
         <p>into biomonitoring strategies, future studies should address knowledge gaps in water mite</p>
         <p>taxonomy, distribution, and ecology. This can be accomplished by emphasizing water mite</p>
         <p>
collections from additional lotic environments, including various stream 
types
(e.g., coldwater
</p>
         <p>vs. warmwater streams), stream sizes (e.g., headwater vs. larger streams and rivers), and stream</p>
         <p>habitats (e.g., riffle/run vs. pool/glide vs edge habitats). In addition, studies could also focus on</p>
         <p>unique ecological characteristics, such as family-, genus-, or species-level pollution tolerances.</p>
         <p>Most macroinvertebrates (e.g., Ephemeroptera, Plectoptera, Trichoptera) are identified to genus</p>
         <p>in water quality assessments, and most genera have their own unique pollution tolerance value.</p>
         <p>This value ranges from 0-10, with lower values indicating that a taxon is sensitive to water</p>
         <p>pollution, and higher values indicate a taxa’s tolerance to high levels of water pollution. When</p>
         <p>utilizing benthic macroinvertebrates to assess water quality, these values play an important role</p>
         <p>
in calculating index of biotic integrity (IBI) metrics (

). To better integrate water

         <p>By understanding which taxa are sensitive or tolerant to pollution or degraded environmental</p>
         <p>conditions, we may be able to successfully develop biological indices similar to those used</p>
         <p>
for Pennsylvania’s benthic macroinvertebrate assessments (

). This could be
</p>
         <p>accomplished by sampling water mites from streams with various impairment sources (e.g.,</p>
         <p>abandoned mine drainage, agriculture, urban runoff). Overall, this study shows that water mites</p>
         <p>can be used as a bioindicator species for water quality; however, further research is needed</p>
         <p>before biologists can fully incorporate water mites into standardized biomonitoring strategies.</p>

Conclusion
</title>
         <p>
Our research provided one of the first detailed examinations of 
Pennsylvania
water mites, but
</p>
         <p>
it is also the first North American study to demonstrate that lotic water mites can be useful as bioindicators of water quality, with some genera showing more tolerance than others. Diversity indices, such as richness and Shannon Diversity, with water mites successfully differentiate between attaining and impaired streams and correlated with other metrics (e.g., Freestone IBI, Total Habitat Score) that quantify water quality. In addition, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hygrobates
</tp:taxon-name>
abundance increased
</p>
         <p>in agriculturally impaired streams, indicating this genus likely has a greater tolerance to agricultural pollution than other water mite genera. Therefore, future water quality assessments</p>
         <p>
in agriculturally influenced watersheds should examine water mite diversity and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hygrobates
</tp:taxon-name>
prevalence. The results that we presented here are comparable to previous studies of water
</p>
         <p>mites as bioindicators from elsewhere in the world and will serve as a foundation for future North American studies of water mites and their associations with stream health.</p>
