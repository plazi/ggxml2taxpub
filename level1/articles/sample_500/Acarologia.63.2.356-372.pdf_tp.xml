ABSTRACT
</title>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
Ixodes ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
is an important vector of several human and veterinary infectious agents.
</p>
         <p>
Its wide geographical distribution and permissive feeding behaviour have prompted earlier studies on its population genetics. Results were, nevertheless, not conclusive. Furthermore, no research has fully focused on the south-western distribution range of 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
, where exchanges between European and North African populations are more likely to occur. The presence of an additional species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ixodes inopinatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, in the area further confuses the topic, as the two species are hard to differentiate morphologically.

The present work describes the testing of microsatellite markers previously described for 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
using Portuguese and Tunisian tick populations of both species. In addition,
</p>
         <p>new microsatellite loci were developed to complement the available marker toolbox.</p>
         <p>
Loci showed different amplification successes across subpopulations, with Tunisian DNA less readily amplified. Altogether, 15 loci were considered suitable for genetic analyses of Portuguese subpopulations, 10 for Tunisian samples, and seven, common to both populations, were considered to be informative at the inter-continental level. A preliminary analysis of both datasets revealed two isolated populations, which can correspond to two different species. Furthermore, Tunisian specimens identified by sequencing of 16S rDNA as having 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. inopinatus
</tp:taxon-name>
sequence profiles all clustered together in one single population using the proposed microsatellites. This confirms that taxonomic decisions based only on 16S rRNA gene sequencing can be misleading. The application of the proposed set of microsatellite markers to a larger sample, representative of the south-western 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ixodes
</tp:taxon-name>
’ distribution range, will be crucial to clarify the distribution of both species.

Evidence for genetic differentiation possibly explaining the observed plasticity of

,

a tick that can adapt to different geographic and ecological environments and to a diversity of vertebrate host species, has been addressed in previous studies, using different 
types
of genetic markers, sampling methods and experimental designs. Results from these previous works revealed either the presence of genetic structure within Europe at a finer (

) or wider geographic scales (

; 

; 

; 

), the presence of host-associated genetic differentiation (Kempf 
et al.
2011), an absence of population structure across Europe (

; 

; 

), or a clear genetic divergence between European and North African 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
populations (

; 

; 

). These earlier studies focused mostly on northern and central European tick communities, while no research has been conducted to understand the relationships between south-western European and North African

populations.

and North African countries (

), and later presumably also in Central Europe (

). Morphological differences between the two species are hard to ascertain with intermediate phenotypes often observed (Younsi 
et al.
2020). Otherwise, the identification of the two species has been based on mitochondrial gene sequencing. Mitochondrial genomes are known to be sometimes affected by introgression or incomplete lineage sorting events, causing discrepancies between mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenetic analyses (

). These problems further emphasize the need for additional analyses of the genetic structure of this (or these) tick species.

         <p>
Microsatellite markers have been used in several of the mentioned population genetics studies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
, as well as in research on other arthropod vectors. Mutation rates of microsatellites are faster than either mitochondrial or nuclear genes, making them more informative at the population scale (Araya-Anchetta 
et al.
2015). A number of microsatellite loci have been described for 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
(

; 

; 

), but only a few of these have been tested in Mediterranean tick populations. Therefore, in this study, previously developed microsatellite markers were tested on Portuguese and Tunisian tick populations. In addition, and to enhance the power of our analyses, newly developed loci were tested. A characterization of the selected loci for both, Portuguese and Tunisian, subsamples is presented. Also, the results of a preliminary intercontinental genetic analysis performed with the most informative loci are described and discussed.

Sampling and study sites
</p>
         <p>
Tick collections were performed from 

February to May 
2019

in two locations: Parque Natural da Peneda Gerês, north of 
Portugal
(
41°47′18.1″N
8°08′10.6″W
) and El Jouza, 
Tunisia
(
36°52′9.88″N
009°0′8.42″E
). Sampling locations are shown in 
Figure 1
. Questing ticks were collected from the environment by dragging and/or flagging the vegetation. Collected specimens were submitted to a surface disinfection protocol consisting of submersion of live ticks in 20% bleach for 5 minutes, followed by submersion in 0.9% saline solution for 5 minutes. Individuals were preserved in 100% ethanol at 4 °C until DNA extraction. For the purpose of this study, only male ticks were used to allow an easier detection and exclusion of loci with potential X-linkage (in such case, a consistent homozygosity would be expected for males).
</p>
         <p>
DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene amplification
</p>
         <p>
Ticks were examined morphologically and were processed for DNA extraction using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen 
N.V.
, Venlo, 
Netherlands
), with some modifications to the manufacturer’s protocol. A small incision was performed in the latero-posterior portion of the scutum or alloscutum, and ticks were incubated at 56 °C in 60 µL of Proteinase K at 
14.3 mg
/ml (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, 
Massachusetts
, 
USA
) and 180 µL ATL, until complete digestion of internal tissues. Volumes of other reagents of the kit were adjusted accordingly and washes with AW1 and AW2 buffers were doubled. DNA was eluted in 60 µL of molecular grade water at 72 °C, yield and purity were assessed by spectrophotometry (
NanodropTM
1000, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, NC, 
USA
), followed by preservation at 4 °C until further use.
</p>
         <p>
A fragment of their 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced by using 16S-F and 16-R primers (

). GenBank accession numbers for the 16S rDNA sequences from Gerês (OP375366 - OP375385) and El Jouza (OP375386 - OP375405) are provided in supplementary table S1 for each tick.

Assessment of previously developed microsatellite loci

         <p>
The amplification conditions for thirty-six previously described microsatellite markers (

; Kempf 
et al.
2011; 

; 

; 

) were optimized for our samples. First, loci were individually amplified using a “touch-down” PCR
</p>
         <p>
programme with pooled tick DNA from five individuals from both study sites. PCR reactions consisted of 1x Type-it® Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen 
N.V.
, Venlo, 
Netherlands
), 0.2
</p>
         <p>
µM of each primer and approximately 
100 ng
of template DNA. Thermocycling conditions followed the protocol recommended by the Type-it kit, adapted to a “touch-down” programme,
</p>
         <p>and consisted of 5 min denaturation at 95 °C; 7 cycles of 30 sec denaturation at 95 °C, 90 sec annealing at 64 °C with a decrease of 2 °C/cycle, 30 sec elongation at 72 °C; followed by 28</p>
         <p>cycles of 30 sec denaturation at 95 °C, 90 sec annealing at 50 °C, 30 sec elongation at 72 °C,</p>
         <p>
and a final extension at 68 °C for 10 min. New primer sets (mod) were designed for two loci showing amplification problems, IRN4 and IRN21 (

) using Primer3 version
</p>
         <p>
4.1.0 (

; 

) with default settings; IRN4mod and IRN21mod primers are listed in 
Table 1
.
</p>
         <p>
For the twenty-nine loci showing successful DNA amplification, primer annealing temperatures (Ta) were further optimized, according to previously described locus-specific thermocycling conditions and primer melting temperatures (Tm). Loci described by 

were tested with the “touch-down” PCR protocol suggested by the authors, adapted to the Type-It kit specifications. This consisted of an initial 5 min denaturation step at 95 °C,
</p>
         <p>followed by 16 cycles of 45 sec at 94 °C, 90 sec at 60 °C with this annealing temperature decreasing by 0.5 °C at each cycle, 30 sec at 72 °C, followed by 25 or 35 cycles of 45 sec at 94</p>
         <p>°C, 90 sec at 52 °C, 30 sec at 72 °C, and a final extension step of 10 min at 68 °C. At this stage,</p>
         <p>pooled DNA, followed by individual DNA samples were used.</p>
         <p>All primer pairs produced amplicons within the expected sizes and were used to genotype</p>
         <p>40 tick DNA samples from both study locations (20 individuals each). For these PCR reactions,</p>
         <p>forward primers were either directly 5′-labelled with fluorophores (Applied Biosystems,</p>
         <p>
Thermo Fisher 
ScientificTM
, Waltham, MA, 
USA
) or amplified with an M13-tail protocol
</p>
         <p>
(
Table 1
). IRN07 primers were labelled and ran using both approaches to confirm the consistency between protocols. For the former, PCR conditions were kept as described before,
</p>
         <p>
using 
2 ng
of template DNA in a total reaction volume of 10 µl, and changing the final extension step to 60 °C for 30 min. For the second protocol, each forward primer was 5′-tagged with an
</p>
         <p>
M13 tail (5′-CACGACGTTGTAAAACGAC-3′) and a 5′-fluorophore labelled M13 sequence was added to the reaction mix. Primer concentrations for the M13 protocol were adapted as follows: reverse primer and labelled tail were kept at 0.2 µM, while concentration of forward tailed primer was reduced to 0.05 µM (

). Thermocycling conditions were as described previously, but with 35 amplification cycles and a final extension step of 60 °C
</p>
         <p>
for 30 min. Samples failing to amplify under these protocols were re-amplified with higher template DNA concentration and/or number of PCR cycles. Fragments were read by capillary electrophoresis using a 3500 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems 
TM
, Thermofisher Scientific,
</p>
         <p>
Waltham, MA, 
USA
) and scored with GeneMarker® v.3.0.1 software (SoftGenetics® LCC,
</p>
         <p>
State College, 
USA
). Fragment sizes were estimated by using the Genescan 
TM-
500 
LIZTM
size standard (Applied 
BiosystemsTM
, Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,

). Twelve loci were excluded due to difficulties in PCR conditions standardization and/or inconsistent results on fragment analysis. The remaining 17 microsatellite loci showed satisfactory amplification profiles and were kept for genetic analysis. Selected loci are described in

), available at https://palfinder.ls.manchester.ac.uk/. Pal_finder software, version 0.02.04.8 (

) was used to find di-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide repeat motifs, using default settings. Primers were designed with Primer3 and the following settings customised for use with the Type-it® Multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen): primer optimum length = 25 nucleotides (ranging from 18 to 30 nucleotides); minimum GC% content = 45%; maximum GC% content
</p>
         <p>= 65%; optimum melting temperature = 68 °C (ranging from 62 °C to 75 °C).</p>
         <p>
This analysis retrieved 1405 dinucleotide PALs, from which any loci showing imperfect or interrupted motifs were excluded, as well as the ones with primers occurring more than once in the entire set of reads. From the 999 remaining PALs, 20 loci with a number of repeat motifs between 11 and 41 were selected for amplification testing (Van Asch 
et al.
2010). Finally, selected PALs’ sequences were compared with previously described microsatellite markers to avoid duplications.

PALs were first tested with the “touch-down” protocol previously described and further optimized with a gradient PCR protocol (annealing temperatures set at 55 °C, 63 °C and 68 °C, according to primers’ Tm range), using pooled and individual tick DNA samples from both sites in study. Loci showing satisfactory amplification profiles (single band at expected size on agarose gel) were sequenced to confirm the presence of the repeat patterns (Eurofins Genomics, 
Luxembourg
). From these, 11 loci were M13-tagged and tested following the M13 protocol described above. Six primer pairs showing inconsistent amplification and two displaying consistent homozygosity (therefore suspected to be X-linked) were eliminated from the study. Three loci (IRL17, IRL40 and IRL69) were kept for the genetic analysis (

Population genetics analyses
</p>
         <p>
The raw data set was coded and converted into all required formats using Create (

). Due to apparent discrepancies in the amplification success at several loci, Portuguese and Tunisian subsamples were initially analysed separately. The two subsamples were analysed together on a subset of loci working well in both sites. Methods used for population genetics data analyses were described in detail in previous papers (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Population genetic structure was first evaluated through linkage disequilibrium (LD) tests and Wright’s fixation indices (Wright 1965). To test for LD, we used the 
G
-based test first described by 

with 10000 permutations, as implemented within Fstat 2.9.4 (

). The Benjamini and Yekutieli (BY) False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure (

) with R version 3.5.1 (R-Core-Team, 2020) was then used to account for repetition of correlated tests. To check if some loci were involved in a significant

         <p>

         <p>
F
-statistics (
F
IS
, 
F
ST
and 
F

) were estimated with Weir and Cockerham’s unbiased estimators (

) with Fstat. Significant departure from 0 of these 
F
-statistics was tested with 10000 randomizations of alleles between individuals within a subsample (
F
IS
; deviation from local random mating test) or of individuals between subsamples within the total sample (
F
ST
; population subdivision test). For 
F
IS
, the statistic used was 
f
(Weir and Cockerham’s 
F
IS
estimator). To test for subdivision, the 
G
-based test (

) over all loci was used, which is the most powerful procedure when combining tests across loci (

).
</p>
         <p>
To compute 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of 
F

F
IS
(StrdErr 
F
IS
) and 
F
ST
(StrdErr

) computed by jackknife over populations, for each locus, or bootstrap over loci for the average across loci. More detailed explanations can be found elsewhere (

</p>
         <p>In case of significant heterozygote deficits (characterized by significant departures from</p>
         <p>
0 of the 
F
-statistics) and LD we tried to discriminate between sampling (Wahlund effect) and technical causes (null alleles, stuttering, short allele dominance (SAD), or allele dropouts) with the determination key proposed by 

. The possible presence of null alleles was also investigated with MicroChecker v 2.2.3 (

) and null allele frequencies estimated with Brookfield’s second method (

). The adjustment between observed and expected numbers of missing data was tested with a unilateral exact binomial test under R with the alternative hypothesis: “there is not enough missing data as expected under panmixia”. MicroChecker also detects stuttering. Stuttering tests were obtained with exact binomial tests comparing observed and expected heterozygotes with one and two base differences computed graphically with MicroChecker. The presence of SAD was assessed with a regression 
F
IS
~Allele size, weighted as described in 

, with a one-sided test (negative slope in case of SAD). To minimize SAD effects, all loci were doublechecked by hunting micro-peaks at long alleles. We also attempted to cure loci with stuttering by pooling alleles close in size. Both methods are described in 

.
</p>
         <p>
In dioecious species, heterozygote excesses are expected at all loci. Nevertheless, null alleles may display heterozygote deficits at affected loci. Default 
F
IS
test is one-sided in Fstat (heterozygote deficit). Two-sided 
–
values were computed as twice the 
p
-value, in case of heterozygote deficit, or twice 1- 
p
-value otherwise.
</p>
         <p>
A more accurate estimate of 
F
ST
can be made for datasets with null alleles after recoding missing genotypes as homozygous for allele 999 (null allele) with the ENA method as implemented in FreeNA (

). RecodeData (

) was used to obtain maximum divergence, and computed the maximum possible 
F

(

) with Fstat. This helped computing the normalized

was far from being the highest and could easily be explained by null alleles, SAD could confidently be excluded. Only LD based (

With this new dataset, eight locus pairs (4.2%) were in significant LD (improvement in power), and none stayed significant after BY correction (all

variation (regression

ρ

p

i.e.
with a minimum of null alleles) stayed positive. This suggested that some loci were still affected by something else. We defined the upper bound of the 95% CI of the regression as ls95% =

i.e.
with an excessive heterozygote deficit, were excluded the regression displayed a

The

was not significantly different between the two sites (

Portugal
(0.5%) and 
Tunisia
(2.25%) (
p
-value = 0.0636, two-sided Fisher exact test). This suggested more null alleles in 
Tunisia
. In 
Portugal
, three loci displayed a significant stuttering signature, against seven in 
Tunisia
, which yielded a non-significant Fisher’s exact test (
p
-value = 0.2733). For now, we may suspect that more
</p>
         <p>
SAD signatures were found in Gerês than in El Jouza, even if several of those were artificially produced by stuttering effects at smaller alleles, since it disappeared after stuttering correction. Locus IRN4 obviously strongly suffered from SAD in the Portuguese subsample and not in the Tunisian one. As far as null alleles and stuttering are concerned, it is probable that Tunisian ticks, due to their important genetic divergence with European ones (

), experienced more amplification problems.

         <p>
In this work, all microsatellite loci previously described for 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
were tested with populations from 
Portugal
and 
Tunisia
. These included 31 loci specifically designed for 
<tp:taxon-name>
I.
</tp:taxon-name>
         </p>
         <p>
ricinus
(

;

) and five loci developed for
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
Ixodes arboricola
</tp:taxon-name>
showing promising cross-amplification with 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
samples (

). To the best of our knowledge, this was the first time that these microsatellite markers were used to genotype Portuguese 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
populations, while only five of them had been previously applied to Tunisian samples (

). From the initial 36
</p>
         <p>markers, only 17 presented consistent amplification profiles and were used in further genetic analyses. This clearly demonstrates that the development of microsatellite loci for a specific population does not always guarantee their applicability across the entire geographic range of the species and reinforces the need for preliminary testing of markers prior to studies targeting new tick populations. The difficulties encountered in our PCR optimization steps were early indicators of the substantial genetic differences occurring between the chosen populations of ticks.</p>
         <p>
In addition, new microsatellite markers were developed. These were designed from 
<tp:taxon-name>
I.
</tp:taxon-name>
         </p>
         <p>
ricinus
genome sequences available online and were tested and standardized with Mediterranean tick populations. From the 20 PALs initially selected for genotyping tests, three loci (IRL17,
</p>
         <p>
IRL40, IRL69) passed to the genetic analyses phase and were considered useful to be included in future studies. These newly developed markers are essential to complement the information provided by the previously described microsatellite loci, deemed insufficient to clearly characterize 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
populations in the study area.
</p>
         <p>The 20 selected microsatellite loci behaved differently when tested with Portuguese or</p>
         <p>
Tunisian ticks. This was already expected, as discrepancies in amplification success between populations at several loci had been previously detected during sample genotyping. Methods for minimizing the effects of SAD and stuttering described by 

were applied with good results in this dataset. After double-checking the chromatograms of homozygous individuals for previously undetected micro-peaks, only two loci showed significant SAD in
</p>
         <p>Gerês subpopulation, and none were found to be affected in El Jouza subsample. Stuttering was detected in both populations, but the use of pooling strategies adjusted to allele size differences,</p>
         <p>
allele frequencies and 
F
IS
, improved heterozygosity estimates for eight (out of 17) and 14 (out of 16) loci in Gerês and El Jouza subpopulations, respectively. The same stuttering “cure”
</p>
         <p>strategy also proved to be effective in the final analysis between the two land masses, improving</p>
         <p>
F
IS
estimates for five (out of seven) loci.
</p>
         <p>
The comparative study of both populations revealed a higher frequency of technical amplification problems (null alleles and stuttering) in El Jouza sample. This is in line with the fact that all loci available for 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
were designed from European ticks, and supports the previously detected divergence between Tunisian and European 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
populations (

</p>
         <p>
Meeûs 
et al.
2002; 

; 

). Private alleles were detected in most loci, and a locus (IRN28) presented no allele in common, being considered diagnostic between the subsamples. Results from STRUCTURE suggest that if introgressed individuals existed in each of the subsamples, maximum introgression was less than 2% in 
Portugal
and less than 3% in 
Tunisia
. However, these values may easily come from the homoplasic nature of microsatellite loci (

), as suggested by the existence of several alleles and one complete locus (IRN28) that are diagnostic of the subsample of origin. The suggested genetic distance is also supported by the very low number of estimated immigrants exchanged per generation between both locations, resulting in two virtually isolated populations, which can correspond to two different species as was hypothesized by 

. Even if ticks are easily transported from one continent to the other, this does not translate into efficient gene flow, raising the question of whether the Tunisian ticks are in fact 

<tp:taxon-name>I. inopinatus</tp:taxon-name>
.

This species was first described in 
Spain
(

Madrid
), 
Portugal
,
</p>
         <p>
Algeria
, 
Morocco
and 
Tunisia
(

) and was observed living in sympatry with 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Tunisia
, namely in the El Jouza region (Younsi 
et al.
2020) and Central Europe
</p>
         <p>
(

). Specimens identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. inopinatus
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Iberian Peninsula were all collected around or south of Madrid (

). Unfortunately, none of the recent publications on population genetics of 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
included ticks collected in the southern part of the Peninsula. Our samples of 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
were also collected from the northern part of 
Portugal
.
</p>
         <p>
Therefore, based on preliminary data, it is possible to conclude that populations from northern 
Portugal
and 
Tunisia
are likely to belong to different species, as suggested by earlier studies. Indeed, microsatellite genotyping (

), nuclear phylogenies
</p>
         <p>
(

), and SNP analyses (

) have already revealed the occurrence of a deep split between North African and European populations. In accordance with other authors, it was confirmed that adult 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. inopinatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
cannot be differentiated by morphology (Younsi 
et al.
2020), but also not by 16S rRNA gene analysis, because all our
</p>
         <p>Tunisian sample, which included both putative species, belonged to the same population when analysed with microsatellite markers.</p>
         <p>
Better diagnostic tools must be developed to positively identify 

<tp:taxon-name>I. inopinatus</tp:taxon-name>
.

In addition,
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
I. inopinatus
</tp:taxon-name>
from the 
type
locality and southern part of the Iberian Peninsula must be included in future population genetics studies, to determine whether they correspond to the separate taxonomic entity occurring in North Africa and 
Sicily
. Based on the distribution of different genotypes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Borrelia lusitaniae
(Norte 
et al.
2021)
</tp:taxon-name>
, a known reptile-associated spirochete, it was hypothesized that the distribution range of the north-African population of ticks extends to the southern part of the Peninsula and is associated to a specific 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. lusitaniae
</tp:taxon-name>
clade. As
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
I
. 
inopinatus
</tp:taxon-name>
is also considered to be a reptile-associated tick (

), it is tempting to assume that the distribution of the tick and specific genotypes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. lusitaniae
</tp:taxon-name>
are linked. Nevertheless, until factual data are provided, it should be noted that this reptileassociated spirochete has been known to travel, albeit sporadically, on ticks carried by birds
</p>
         <p>
(

), which might result in the tick and the spirochete evolutionary histories to be uncoordinated as is the case in another 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ixodes
species
</tp:taxon-name>
(

).
</p>
         <p>
Therefore, further studies will be needed to taxonomically define 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
populations belonging to this tick’s south-western distribution range. Microsatellite markers sets defined in this study should be applied to larger tick samples, comprising additional locations across the
</p>
         <p>
Iberian Peninsula and the north of Africa. These results, together with interbreeding studies conducted between European and Tunisian tick populations, will add useful arguments to discuss the taxonomic status of the different units found among the

Conclusion
</title>
         <p>
In this work, we have revisited all microsatellite markers previously developed for 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
and specifically tested them with Portuguese and Tunisian tick populations, to ascertain their suitability for this species’ population genetics studies in the Mediterranean region. Additionally, new microsatellite loci have been developed to add to the currently available ones. Altogether, 15 suitable loci were identified for genetic analyses of Portuguese subpopulations,
</p>
         <p>10 loci for Tunisian ones, and seven informative loci to be used in inter-continental studies.</p>
         <p>
A preliminary analysis of both datasets revealed two isolated populations, which are likely to correspond to two different species. The sets of microsatellite markers defined here can now be applied to larger-scale studies in the Mediterranean transition zone, hopefully contributing to define the population structure of 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
s.l.
across its geographic range and the taxonomic status of 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. inopinatus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Interbreeding experiments, performed between European and Tunisian populations will also provide useful information to complement our understanding of the evolutionary genetics of 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. ricinus
</tp:taxon-name>
populations.
