We dedicate this contribution to Dr Rut Collado (1967–2015), University of A Coruña, 
Spain
, who uncovered the diversity of naidid oligochaetes, mainly species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Pristina</tp:taxon-name>
, at the sites sampled in this investigation.

Abstract
</title>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Enchytraeidae</tp:taxon-name>
are known to be an important group of soil animals in temperate regions of the world but their diversity as well as their contribution to soil functions, esp. litter decomposition, in the humid tropics remain largely unexplored. 
Therefore
, as part of the SHIFT (‘ 

Studies of 
Human Impact on Floodplains

and 
Forests
in the 
Tropics’
) project ENV 52, entitled ‘ 
Soil Fauna
and 
Litter Decomposition’
, their species composition, abundance and biomass were determined in an experimental agroforestry area located about 
20 km
north of 
Manaus
(
Amazonia

In
addition, individuals of the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Naididae</tp:taxon-name>
were sampled at these plots as well. 
The
aim of the project was to study the regeneration and anthropogenic usage of degraded forest areas, to mitigate the human impact on primary rain forests in Amazonia. Study sites were two polyculture tree plantations (POA, POC) and two plots of nearby secondary (growing since 1984, SEC) and undisturbed primary forest (FLO). 
Samples
for both 
<tp:taxon-name>Enchytraeidae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Naididae</tp:taxon-name>
were taken quarterly for two years and the worms were extracted by wet extraction (120 samples, each divided into litter and soil layer) per sampling date. 
The
enchytraeids were identified in vivo, whereas naidids were initially only counted. 
Later
on, and after fixation in EtOH, selected specimens were identified. 
Identification
of the worms followed a site-specific key, based on information from the literature and own experience. 
The
biomass of larger enchytraeids (i.e., the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Guaranidrilus
</tp:taxon-name>
) was determined via weighing, while the biomass of smaller enchytraeids was estimated by using values previously determined for 
European
species of similar size. 
In
total, 18 enchytraeid and 14 naidid species were found. 
Most
of the former belonged to the mainly neotropical genus 
<tp:taxon-name>

(2) were also found. 
The
abundance of enchytraeids found in the primary forest (
1,000
–10,000
Ind/m²) was comparable to those found at other tropical rain forest sites. The abundance in all four plots was similar, whereas the biomass was lower in POA and POC than in FLO and SEC. However, variability between replicates was high. No annual phenology pattern was observed, but dry conditions in 1997 had a negative influence on enchytraeids. The four plots were similar concerning species number and composition, but dominance patterns differed: the dominant genus in FLO was 

<tp:taxon-name>Hemienchytraeus</tp:taxon-name>
,

but 
<tp:taxon-name>
Guaranidrilus

on all other plots. Naidids seem to regularly occur in terrestrial samples of tropical rain forests; their species number was high in relation to their abundance but most species were new to science. The micro-annelid community indicated a clear distinction between forest (FLO, SEC) and plantation (POA, POC) sites

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Based on experiences from temperate ecosystems it is assumed that important soil functions and services such as sustainable primary production or nutrient cycling (

) depend mainly on the activities of soil organisms, such as microbes (e.g., 

) and invertebrates, especially earthworms (

). However, in central Amazonia earthworms are rare and, despite their partly huge individual size (i.e., with a length of up to one meter), their impact on the soil system seems to be limited (Römbke et al. 1999). Little is known about the role of other soil organisms, especially the mesofauna, in providing these services in Amazonian soils (

). Thus, the work described in this contribution was aiming to increase our knowledge of two oligochaete groups in these soils, i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>Enchytraeidae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Naididae</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
Initially, the work focused only on enchytraeids as the representatives of mesofauna annelids. They are known to be an important group of invertebrate soil animals in temperate regions of the world but their contribution to soil functions, especially litter decomposition, in the humid tropics remains largely unexplored (

). However, during the project it became clear that another family of mesofauna-annelids is also diverse, frequent and abundant in these soils, namely the 
<tp:taxon-name>Naididae</tp:taxon-name>
, usually considered as an aquatic group (

). This family, including the former 
<tp:taxon-name>Tubificidae</tp:taxon-name>
according to recent phylogenetic classifications (

), was subsequently included in the investigations, i.e., by performing additional samplings at the project site (mainly in order to get more material for the description of the new species). In the following, enchytraeids and naidids will be referred to as ‘micro-annelids’ (in contrast to ‘mega-faunal’ oligochaetes, the earthworms).
</p>
         <p>
As part of the SHIFT (‘Studies of Human Impact on Floodplains and Forests in the Tropics’) project ENV 52 ‘Soil Fauna and Litter Decomposition’, carried out from 1997 to 2004, the species composition, abundance, and biomass of these two groups were determined in two polyculture forestry plantations and in nearby secondary and primary forest (one plot each) in central Amazonia, 
Brazil
(

). The contribution of these faunal groups to litter decomposition was assessed as well. The two polyculture plots were designed as an alternative to the conventionally grown annual crops in the Amazon region. The general aim of the project was to study the regeneration and anthropogenic usage of already degraded areas, to mitigate the human impact on primary rain forest in Amazonia, with a special focus on the soil ecology of these areas. This contribution focuses on one basic aspect of the project: the diversity of 
<tp:taxon-name>Enchytraeidae</tp:taxon-name>
and, to a lesser extent, 
<tp:taxon-name>Naididae</tp:taxon-name>
. Preliminary results of these investigations have already been published (e.g., Römbke &amp; Meller 1999). Here, we include abundance data and records of micro-annelids covering all sampling methods applied in the study: sampling of soil cores, exposing litter bags, and qualitative sampling.

2.1 Characteristics of the study sites
</title>
         <p>
The
study area of the SHIFT project ENV 52 was located at km 29 on the road 
Manaus-Itacoatiara
(AM-010) adjacent to the research station of EMBRAPA (
Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária
) – 
Amazonia Ocidental
(
Amazonas
, 
Brazil
) (

). 
The
geographical coordinates are 
02°53‘47‘‘S
and 
59°59‘45‘‘W
. 
The area
was flat, i.e. its highest elevations was 

50–100 m
above sea level

. Mean annual precipitation during the study period was 
2400 mm

.
</p>
         <p>
The area was divided into four study plots: an agroforestry plantation, divided into two adjacent study plots (POA, POC), a secondary forest (SEC), and a primary forest (FLO), all of them located close to each other. The FLO and SEC plots had a size of 
40 m
x 
40 m
, while the POA and POC plots had a size of 
32 m
x 

48 m
.

In the latter two, several tree species of commercial use had been planted in rows, but the tolerated secondary vegetation (mainly 
<tp:taxon-name>
Vismia
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
, Guttiferae) still dominated the stand and especially the litter production (

; 

). The primary forest was an undisturbed (&gt; 100 years) typical ‘terra firme’ (Portuguese for ‘firm land’) site, and comprised a mixed vegetation of hundreds of different plant species. None out of the approximately 40 tree species were dominant. An overview of the study site is given in 

Figure 1.

2.2 Climate
</title>
         <p>
The climate of our study area was classified as an Aftype (A = mean temperature of all months&gt; 18°C; f = monthly precipitation&gt; 
60 mm
), according to Köppen (

). Monthly maximum temperature, average air and soil temperatures were highest in 
September 1997
, and total annual rainfall in 1997 was 12–28 % lower than in the other study years (

Fig. 2

).
</p>
         <p>
The year 1997 (when sampling started, see below) was classified as an ‘El Niño year’ (

). Mean temperatures in the litter layer usually ranged from 25.6 to 27.7°C (min. 23.7°C, max. 34.7°C), and in the top soil (
0–5 cm
) from 25.7 to 26.1°C (min. 23.7°C, max. 27.7°C) (

). Average moisture in the litter layer was 97 %. The monthly litter temperatures were on average 2–4°C higher at POA and POC than at FLO and SEC. The highest average litter and soil temperatures as well as temperature maxima were recorded in POA and POC. The extent of canopy closure strongly determined litter temperatures at all sites (

).

2.3 Soil properties
</title>
         <p>
Soil properties were determined according to ISO guidelines (

, 

,b). The soil 
type
at all sites was Xanthic Ferrasol (sandy acid clay): 60 % clay, 25 % sand, 15 % silt (FAO/UNESCO 1990). (

Table 1

). Soil pH was between 3.5 and 4.5 and the carbon and nitrogen content in the top soil layer (
0–5 cm
) showed a range of 2.5–4.5 % and 0.20–0.31 %, respectively. These values agree well with those of another study carried out at the same sites (

). Water holding
</p>
         <p>capacity was markedly higher at FLO than at SEC and POA (no data are available for POC).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="multiple">
         <title>
2.4 Soil core sampling
</title>
         <p>
Soil and litter samples (out of the same core) were taken every two to three months over a period of almost two years between 
July 1997
and 
March 1999
, resulting in eight sampling dates. Samples were taken using a soil corer with a diameter of 
6.4 cm
(ISO 2006). In the field, each core was divided into two depth layers, the litterlayer including the root-mat and the uppermost mineral soil layer (
0–5 cm
depth). Each layer per core was stored separately. In total, 60 cores = 120 samples were taken per date: in POA and POC 10 cores each; in SEC and FLO 20 cores each. Micro-annelids were collected via the water flotation method (Römbke 1995; compliant with ISO 23611-3 (2007)) from the soil core samples. Extraction was done separately for the two layers when possible. In particular at the POA and POC plots, but, depending on the season, occasionally at the other sites as well, the litter layer was very thin or even absent. In addition to the general sampling programme, further soil core samplings were performed at the same sites but after the original sampling programme in order to get more material for the description of the new species, in particular of the naidids.

2.5 Litterbag sampling
</title>
         <p>
In the same plots, organic matter decomposition was measured using the litter bag method (

), which in the meantime has been described in detail in an OECD guidance document (

). Micro-annelids were collected from litterbags with three mesh sizes in order to assess their contribution to the process of litter decomposition (

). Based on the results of a preliminary study (

), the following mesh-sizes were chosen: 
10 mm
gauze for the coarse mesh bags, 
0.25 mm
gauze as medium mesh and 20 µm for fine mesh bags. The experiment started in the summer of 1997 and the bags were exposed in the field in 
September 1997
. At each of the six sampling dates between 
November 1997
and 
July 1998
, usually two bags with the same mesh-size were taken from the FLO and SEC areas except at the first date (
November 1997
), when only one bag per mesh-size was retrieved. In POA and POC, one bag per mesh-size and plot was taken at each sampling date, respectively. In 
November 1997
, POC was not sampled. A preliminary examination of some samples revealed an abundance relationship between enchytraeids and naidids of 1: 
1 in
the coarse litterbags and 1: 2 to 1: 
4 in
the medium and fine mesh litterbags, respectively. All worms were stored in 70 % EtOH immediately after determination.

         <title>
2.6 Micro-annelid extraction
</title>
         <p>The micro-annelids were collected from the soil core samples and from the litter bags by same the standard wet-extraction-method described already for the soil cores (Römbke 1995; compliant with ISO 23611-3 (2007)). As a first step the fresh weight of all litter samples was determined. Extraction time was approximately 3 days at 22 ± 3°C (20–22°C is optimal). Subsequently the enchytraeids were immediately identified in vivo, whereas naidids were identified after fixation in EtOH.</p>

      <sec sec-type="multiple">
         <title>
2.7 Micro-annelid identification
</title>
         <p>
Selected animals were stained and mounted individually on object slides. Identification of the micro-annelids was carried out to genus-level, following a site-specific key, prepared for the EMBRAPA site based on information from the literature and from the INPA (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia) collection. Specimens were separated into morpho-species using light-microscopical characters. Consistent identification to species-level was not possible because at the time of the study almost nothing was known about micro-annelid species diversity from Central Amazonia, with exception of few individual species (e.g., 

). Some of the enchytraeid species were recognized and described only later (e.g., 

; 

), but most of them are still not described. In addition, several new naidid species were described after the end of the study (

,b; 

; 

). Due to these taxonomic uncertainties, most of the ecological results presented here focus on the genus level.

2.8 Biomass measurement
</title>
         <p>
This parameter was only determined for enchytraeids (no method and/or comparable data were available for the 
<tp:taxon-name>Naididae</tp:taxon-name>
). The determination of the biomass of these small and quickly desiccated worms is very difficult. Therefore, the following procedure was performed: some of the larger individuals (especially adult worms of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Guaranidrilus
</tp:taxon-name>
) were weighed directly. The biomass of other enchytraeid species was estimated by using values previously determined for European species of similar size (

).

Mean abundance and biomass of enchytraeids in the four plots (on average

Tables 3

and in 

Figure 3

(abundance only, sum of soil and litter samples). Average abundance as well as biomass values were lower at the two plantation areas than in the two forest plots, on average by about 20 %. However, the variability at each date in 1997 and 1998 was so high that these differences are statistically not significant. In 1998 both values were higher in the wet season (December–April) than in the dry season (June– October). Lowest numbers were found in 1997, probably due to the extreme drought in late 1997. Biomass dynamics follow the abundance curve, with very few exceptions; thus, biomass curves are not presented here (but see 

Table 5

ratio which is in the normal range known from ecological studies in temperate regions (e.g., Römbke 1989, 

). Nearly no differences of this ratio were found between the four plots (

Table 5

): 69 to 75 % of all enchytraeids were juvenile. This ratio was quite stable during the whole study period in all four plots. Due to the problematic taxonomic situation and the fact that often juveniles can only be determined to the genus level, no data on the juvenile/adult ratio for the individual species are presented here.

Enchytraeid abundance and biomass were determined separately in the two layers (litter and soil); the litter to soil ratio (based on abundance) is given in 

Figure 4

and 

Table 5

. On average, the worms were more or less evenly distributed between the two layers at FLO and SEC, but at the two plantation sites the majority was found in the soil. During the dry season no worms were found at all in many litter samples. In general, in POA and POC the

         <p>abundance in the litter layer was much lower than in the soil layer. The litter/soil ratio in FLO (41: 59 %) and SEC (58: 42 %) differed strongly between the first three sampling dates compared to the remaining study period: in the latter period the abundance in the litter was much higher than in the soil. These differences were probably caused by the moisture regime: in the dry period in 1997 there were about twice as many worms in the soil than in the litter layer while in the remaining time period more than twice as many enchytraeids were found in the litter except for the last sampling date. In short: if the moisture was sufficient, the worms preferred the litter layer. Only during periods of drought stress, they either retreated to deeper layers, or died. The same but even more pronounced behavior was true for the naidids.</p>

in the months March till June, but did only rarely occur in samples taken in the other months, in the soil cores. Peaks in abundance coincided with the rainy season in March and lasted for one to three months (no samples were taken in January). Basically, the same pattern was found at the other three plots as well, meaning that naidids were found most regularly and also in the highest numbers in the primary forest (FLO), while on the other three plots they occurred less regularly and in (slightly) lower numbers.

Enchytraeid numbers:
</title>
         <p>
Numbers of enchytraeids counted in the litterbags are presented in 
Table 6
. Enchytraeids were found at each sampling date. Two bags with the same mesh-width were taken from the FLO and SEC areas except at the first date (
November 1997
), where only one bag was used. In POA and POC always just one bag per area was taken, respectively (

Table 6

). Again, in 
November 1997
only POA was sampled. In 
February 1998
, erroneously both bags per mesh-width were taken from POC whereas no bag was used from POA.
</p>
         <p>
However, due to the dry soil at these dates no worms were expected in the respective bags. By far the highest number of worms were found at the FLO plot while, with one exception (
January 1998
at SEC), no or only very few individuals (1–6 per bag) were sampled at the other two sites. Thus, only at the FLO site the three mesh sizes could be compared regarding enchytraeid numbers. No clear difference between the three mesh sizes was found.

Naidid numbers:
</title>

Naidids were found at all sampling dates but in very different numbers in the four plots (

Table 7

. They occurred most regularly in the primary forest (FLO; maximum: 92 Ind/bag in 
July 1998
, minimum: 3 Ind/ bag in 
December 1997
). In SEC, with one exception (46 Ind/bag in 
July 1998
), always low to very low numbers were found. In both agroforestry plantation plots (POA, POC) no naidid worms were found even during the rainy season. This situation was probably caused by the lack of a continuous litter layer in the rows between the trees at both plantation sites, meaning that there were regularly times with dry, i.e., unfavourable, conditions at these sites. Similar but less drastic observations were also made for enchytraeids.

4.1 Literature records of enchytraeids and naidids in Central Amazonia
</title>
         <p>
Prior
to this study, very little was known about the species diversity of enchytraeids in 
Amazonian forest
soils, and the few previous finds are poorly documented. 
For
example, the

Righi, 1978

, and deposited in the collection of the INPA museum (Manaus), was found to be destroyed (Römbke, pers. obs.)

.
</p>
         <p>
No comparable data on naidids from terrestrial sites are known to us from the Manaus region. However, in inundation forests of the Manaus region the abundance of the naidid species 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. multibranchiata
</tp:taxon-name>
is usually about 200–300 Ind/m 
2
(

), whereas in blackwater regions a maximum of up to 10,000 Ind/m 
2
can be reached (

). The investigation of the naidids was not part of the original project but these organisms were found regularly, both in the soil core samples and in the litterbags. Not much was done with this material, but Augustsson showed, as part of her Ph.D. thesis, that they are quite common in the soils of the study area, especially in the primary forest (

). In any case, it is highly likely that these micro-annelids are much more common in terrestrial habitats than it is known today. In fact, except for some isolated information, like the occurrence of the naidid species 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pristina jenkinae
</tp:taxon-name>
(

, as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pristinella jenkinae
</tp:taxon-name>
) in a Peruvian rain forest, nearly nothing is known about naidid species in tropical soils. The high diversity of a predominantly aquatic family at the study sites was therefore surprising. Interestingly all species belong to genera where asexual reproduction is common (

). 

suggest this as a prerequisite for aquatic oligochaete taxa to colonize terrestrial habitats.
</p>
         <p>
Under certain favorable conditions (e.g., in January and, partly, in 
April 1998
) enchytraeid and naidid worms entered the SEC litterbags. Nearly no worms were found in POA and only very few in POC litterbags. Probably this situation was caused by the unfavorable abiotic conditions in the litterbags, which were exposed on the soil surface to very high temperatures and thus dry conditions, killing all worms or driving them out of the litter back into the soil.
</p>
         <p>
The worms from the two annelid families differed strongly in size. The naidids, mostly represented by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pristina
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
, were only up to 
1 mm
long, and juveniles (fragmenting specimens) often much smaller (length ca. 
0.5 mm
, diameter often down to 60 µm). This explains, at least partly, why they were so abundant, especially in the fine litterbags, leading to the situation that the overall number in all three mesh-widths of FLO litterbags was similar but in tendency even higher in the medium and fine mesh bags. However, an open question remains: How could have enchytraeids entered a fine-mesh litterbag? Adult worms, with a body diameter of 
0.14 to 0.4 mm
, were too big to pass a mesh size of 20 µm. Cocoons falling through the mesh can also be excluded, since their smallest width equals the body diameter of an adult worm (

). Freshly hatched juvenile specimens, often not wider than 
0.06 mm
, may be able to pass: due to the plasticity of these soft-bodied worms, enchytraeids are able to pass holes of less than 1/4 of their usual body diameter (Schmelz, pers. obs.). However, we suspect that tropical soil arthropods created small holes exceeding the size of the fine mesh, undetectable with the naked eye but large enough for enchytraeids to pass.
</p>
         <p>
The contribution of micro-annelids to litter decomposition is evidently zero or very low at sites without or with very few specimens in the litter bags (
Table 6
). Due to the presence of micro-annelids even in bags with the finest mesh size, our data cannot be used to estimate the contribution of these worms to litter decomposition. Their contribution at sites without severe drought, however, deserves further study, since there are indications from studies in temperate regions that micro-annelids worms influence nutrient mobilization in flooded soils (

).
</p>
         <p>
In general, and considering field methods under tropical conditions, sampling and extraction of soil annelids are quite similar to ecological studies in temperate regions. In case that an air-conditioned laboratory is available within a short distance from the study site, almost no differences regarding the technical performance occur. But even if such a laboratory is not at hand, the investigation of micro-annelids is possible. In such a case, a temperature range of 15–25°C has to be secured during the transfer of the cooled samples to a laboratory. For quantitative studies, cooled samples should be stored not longer than one week; for qualitative studies, however, worms can be obtained even after two months of storage at room temperature (20 ºC, Schmelz &amp; Collado, pers. obs.). 

give an introduction into the methodology of studying enchytraeids under tropical conditions. They recommend storage of samples not below 12ºC.

Influence of climate on enchytraeids:
</title>
         <p>
Our results indicate that the numbers of enchytraeids depend on the climatically influenced soil properties, especially soil moisture (

). Martius et al. (2004) showed that biomass of macrofauna (including earthworms) and arthropod mesofauna is correlated with the canopy closure as a proxy for different climate-related factors. Enchytraeids were not included in this study, but due to their life form it is very likely that they react at least as much as the other organism groups. Enchytraeids are very sensitive to drought in combination with increased temperatures (

), a condition that occurred regularly in the litter layer of all study plots of the present study. Similarly, earthworms were found mostly in the wet season (with a peak in March) but due to their low absolute numbers this relationship is difficult to prove (Römbke et al. 1999).

Comparison of our results with other tropical soil ecological studies:
</title>
         <p>The abundance and biomass values found in the four investigated plots are very difficult to compare with</p>
         <p>

literature values from the tropics since almost none exist so far. In 

Table 8

ecological studies with enchytraeids performed in subtropical and tropical rainforests are listed. As far as can be said from this limited information (e.g., only in this study and at Pasoh (
Malaysia
) samples were taken in different seasons), enchytraeids seem to be relatively rare (i.e., less than 10,000 Ind/m 
2
) in tropical rain forests in comparison to moist temperate soils (

). [In contrast, abundance can be very high at cool montane sites, see the review in 

]. In an intensive study performed in two regions with differently aged forests on two soil 
types
in south-eastern 
Brazil
(
Paraná
; 
Atlantic Rain Forest
), using the same wet-extraction method, also less than 10,000 
Ind
/m 
2
were found (

). 
In
that study, diversity was very high – 61 enchytraeid species could be discriminated. 
Actually
, with the exception of this last study no other example was found in which the enchytraeid fauna would have been studied in such detail, i.e., during several years in different plots with various parallel investigations (e.g., on litter decomposition or the influence of canopy closure on soil fauna) and – last but not least - addressing the species level

5. Conclusions and outlook
</title>
         <p>The most important results gained when investigating the micro-annelid worms of the four EMBRAPA plots can be summarized as follows, taking into consideration that the study described here is one of the few ecological investigations of micro-annelids in neotropical rain forests: - slightly modified methods routinely used in temperate regions are also useful in the tropics;</p>
         <p>- the number of enchytraeids in the primary forest was comparable to those few described from other rain forest sites; however, the data basis is very small;</p>
         <p>- nothing is known about enchytraeid assemblages of tropical secondary forests or agro forestry sites; thus, a literature comparison with our data was not possible;</p>
         <p>- enchytraeid abundance at all four plots was quite similar whereas the biomass was lower on POA and POC than in FLO and SEC;</p>
         <p>- no clear annual population dynamics were observed for enchytraeids, but the dry conditions in 1997 had a negative influence on numbers and biomass; in contrast, naidids showed peaks of abundance in the rainy season;</p>
         <p>
- in general, the four plots were similar concerning species number (high in comparison to many forest sites in temperate regions) and composition, but the dominance spectrum was different (e.g., the dominant genus was 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hemienchytraeus
</tp:taxon-name>
in FLO and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Guaranidrilus
</tp:taxon-name>
in all other plots);
</p>
         <p>- the juvenile/adult ratio was very similar in all plots and at all sampling dates;</p>
         <p>- the litter layer was significantly less inhabited in POA and POC than in FLO and SEC;</p>
         <p>- nothing can be said so far concerning the ratio between endemic and peregrine species since the taxonomic assessment is not completed;</p>
         <p>- a clear relationship between climatic parameters (positively: rainfall, humidity; negatively: soil and litter temperature and dryness) with enchytraeid biomass were found; some exceptions (especially in POA) cannot be fully explained;</p>
         <p>- naidids were regularly found in terrestrial samples of a tropical rain forest for the first time; their species number (14) seems to be high (about two-thirds of them are known to science so far);</p>
         <p>- based on the results of litterbag samples, micro-annelids (especially naidids) can reach high numbers under favorable conditions (especially in the permanently moist litter layer of FLO);</p>
         <p>- the same distribution pattern was found when assessing the soil-core samples: naidids were quite abundant in FLO, rare in SEC and practically lacking in POA and POC.</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>Based on these results, the micro-annelid biocoenosis indicated a clear distinction of FLO (and partly SEC) in comparison to POA and POC. There are still some open questions:</p>
         <p>- the correlation between micro-annelid biomass and litter stock and/or decomposition rates has to be determined;</p>
         <p>
- the role of naidids has to be assessed further (including laboratory tests on feeding habits and respiration (

));
</p>
         <p>Finally, these data could be used as an incentive to study the specific contribution of these organisms to the decomposition of organic matter at tropical moist forest sites. Since it is not to be expected that the direct influence of these small worms (taking their relatively low biomass into account) on decomposition is very high, further assessment should concentrate on their potential role as indicators, e.g., for anthropogenic effects.</p>
