ABSTRACT
</p>
         <p>
The botanical delimitation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus
species
</tp:taxon-name>
and cultivars may be facilitated by characterizing the pigment profiles of their red- and yellow-fleshed arils. Therefore, we determined genuine carotenoid profiles of differently colored arils of seven defined cultivars of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
L
. and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus

Rehder.
</tp:taxon-name>
In-depth HPLC-DAD-ESI/ APCI-MS 

n

analyses revealed the presence of 43 carotenoids. Exceptional 
retro
-carotenoids dominated the profiles of all samples assessed. Rhodoxanthin (
E/Z
)-isomers were predominant in the red-colored arils, resulting in a rather unusual abundance of carotenoid isomers as expressed by ratios of up to 1.3:2.0:0.9 between (all- 
E
)-, (6 
Z
)-, and (6 
Z
,6 
′
Z
)-rhodoxanthin, respectively. By contrast, the uncommon yellow arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
L
. ‘Lutea’ mainly contained eschscholtzxanthin (
E/Z
)-isomers and esters. Total carotenoid concentrations ranged from 17.00 to 58.78 μg/g fresh weight across all samples assessed. Highest total rhodoxanthin concentrations of 51.33 ± 0.46 μg/g fresh weight were obtained from the red arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
‘Hicksii’. Overall, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus
</tp:taxon-name>
arils represent a promising source of carotenoids and, in particular, of 
retro
-carotenoids with exceptional molecular structures and extraordinary absorption properties.

            <tp:taxon-name>
Taxus baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
L

(

). The European yew (
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
) and its numerous related cultivars, e.g., ‘Elegantissima’ and ‘Washingtonii’, ubiquitously occur in the Euro-Mediterranean region (

). Hybrids of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
are found worldwide, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
T.

Rehder
</tp:taxon-name>
that originated from the hybridization of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. cuspidata
Siebold &amp; Zucc.
</tp:taxon-name>
(

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
have gained scientific publicity because of their toxic needles and seeds, representing natural sources of the taxanes baccatin III and 10-deacetylbaccatin III that are precursors of the anticancer active paclitaxel (Appendino et al., 1993; Appendino, 1995; 

). Yew arils, i.e., the fleshy tissue that surrounds the naked seeds, have frequently been described as edible, fleshy, and energy-rich (

; 

). They are regularly consumed by humans either fresh or processed, e.g., in jams (

; 

). Although comparably low amounts of five taxane-derived compounds have been detected in arils for the first time, acute or chronic toxicity of yew arils cannot be concluded from the currently available data (

).
</p>
         <p>
Fully ripe arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
are attractive to birds owing to their mostly deep red color (

), which has been attributed to the 
retro
-carotenoid rhodoxanthin (Appendino, 1995; 

). In addition, β- carotene, zeaxanthin, eschscholtzxanthin, and eschscholtzxanthone have been tentatively assigned as minor carotenoids of red-fleshed 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
arils (Bodea et al., 1964; 

), although their unambiguous identification has not yet been accomplished. Moreover, the pigment profiles of unfrequently occurring yellow to golden-orange arils have remained unclear (

; Appendino, 1995). The 
retro
-carotenoids eschscholtzxanthin, eschscholtzxanthone, and rhodoxanthin may be considered as compounds of particular interest due to their higher antioxidant capacity compared to that of β- carotene as reported by 

. Moreover, rhodoxanthin has been described to be a promising pigment for conveying bright red to purple color hues to foods and beverages using techno-functional formulations prepared thereof (

). The molecular structure of rhodoxanthin features an exceptionally large π- electron system of 14 conjugated double bonds, including two unusual exocyclic double bonds that have been reported to readily undergo (
E
)- to (
Z
)-isomerization upon dissolution in solvents and even mild thermal treatments (

). In nature, abundant amounts of (6 
Z
)- and (6 
Z
,6 
′
Z
)-rhodoxanthin were frequently encountered in rhodoxanthin-containing plant tissues, e.g., the leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxodium distichum

(
L

<tp:taxon-name>
Cryptomeria japonica
</tp:taxon-name>
(Thunb. ex 
L
.f.) D.Don (

) or the red-colored berries of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lonicera
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
(

). However, a comprehensive profiling of genuine carotenoids, including geometrical isomers and esters, is not yet available for differently colored arils of cultivars of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
and related hybrids.
</p>
         <p>
Therefore, we present in-depth characterizations of carotenoid profiles from red- and yellow-colored arils of nine different yew trees, comprising seven defined cultivars of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
and an interspecific hybrid 
<tp:taxon-name>
T.
× 
media
</tp:taxon-name>
. Carotenoids were identified and quantitated using high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) and electrospray ionization (ESI) as well as atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) multi-stage mass-spectrometry (MS 

n

). We sought to gain novel insights into the carotenoid profiles of yew arils, possibly facilitating the chemotaxonomic differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
and cultivars and, ultimately, highlighting yew arils as promising natural source of carotenoids with high pigment concentrations.

Representative HPLC-DAD chromatograms of carotenoids from red (a) and yellow (b) arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus

</tp:taxon-name>
and cultivars according to 
Table 1
are illustrated in 
Fig. 1
. In total, 43 carotenoids were detected in our study (
Tables 2
and 
3
). Carotenoid profiles of both red- and yellow-colored arils were dominated by 
retro
-structured xanthophylls, i.e., (all- 
E
)-rhodoxanthin (
19
), (all- 
E
)-eschscholtzxanthin (
21
), and various geometrical isomers derived thereof (
5
, 
6
, 
8–17
, 
20
). Less abundant free carotenoids were identified as (all- 
E
)-violaxanthin (
1
), (all- 
E
)-lutein (
2
), (all- 
E
)-zeaxanthin (
3
), and (all- 
E
)-β- carotene (
18
). Moreover, esters of β- cryptoxanthin (
22
, 
23
, 
26
), lutein (
24
, 
25
, 
27
, 
28b

), eschscholtzxanthin (

37–43
), and eschscholtzxanthone (
29
, 
31
, 
32
, 
34
, 
36
) were assigned, having fatty acyl moieties of lauric, myristic, and palmitic acid. The genuine carotenoid profiles obtained from red- and yellow-fleshed arils unraveled a broader diversity of carotenoids within the species

and

compared to that of previous studies reporting solely rhodoxanthin as the major carotenoid (Appendino, 1995; 

). Eschscholtzxanthone, eschscholtzxanthin, β- carotene, and zeaxanthin have been reported as minor carotenoids of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
arils (Bodea et al., 1964; 

), although an unambiguous identification had not been achieved. We now present a detailed characterization of free and esterified carotenoids, being identified on the basis of comprehensive HPLC-DAD-ESI/APCI-MS 

n

data (

HPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn
experiments of free carotenoids

</title>
         <p>
Compounds 
1
, 
2
, and 
3
were identified by comparing their retention times, UV/vis spectra, and mass spectral data to those of authentic reference standards (
Table 2
). The 5,6-diepoxy carotenoid (all- 
E
)-violaxanthin (
1
) was eluting first in our chromatogram, displaying molecular ions [M] 
+•
at 
m/z
600 and protonated molecules [M + H] 
+
at 
m/z
601 in
the ESI positive ion mode. Collision induced dissociation (CID) in the ESI(+)-MS 
2
experiment resulted in fragment ions at 
m/z
583 ([M + H – H 
2
O] 
+
) and 
m/z
565 ([M + H – 2 H 
2
O] 
+
) due to the loss of water. Further product ions were determined at 
m/z
509 ([M + H – 92] 
+
) and 
m/z
491 ([M + H – H 
2
O – 92] 
+
), presumably upon toluene elimination of 92 atomic mass units (amu) from the polyene chain according to

         <p>
Compound 
2
was identified as (all- 
E

+•
at 
m/z
568 and, at low abundance, protonated molecules [M + H] 
+
at 
m/z
569 in
the ESI positive ion mode. An abundant in-source fragment at 
m/z
551 ([M + H – H 
2
O] 
+
) was formed in the ESI(+)-MS 
1
experiment, resulting from the spontaneous elimination of water at the ε- ring as reported earlier by 

and Schex et al. (2018). The ESI(+)-MS 
2
spectrum revealed a base peak at 
m/z
533 ([M + H – 2 H 
2
O] 
+
). In accordance with the literature (Schex et al., 2018; 

), the fragment ions detected at 
m/z
495 ([M + H – H 
2
O – 56] 
+
) and 
m/z
429 ([M + H – H 
2
O 122] 
+
) were attributed to 
retro
-- Diels-Alder fragmentation of the ε- ring and cleavage of hydroxylated ε- or β- rings, respectively.

         <p>
Compound 
3
was unambiguously assigned to (all-

at 
m/z
568 and protonated molecules [M + H]

at 
m/z
569 (both ESI(+)-MS

2
experiment, we detected distinct fragment ions at 
m/z
551 ([M + H – H 
2
O]

), 
m/z
477 ([M + H – 92]

Compounds 
12
, 
16
, and 
19
were the three major carotenoids in red-colored arils (
Fig. 1a
), being identified as (6 
Z
,6 
′
Z
)-, (6 
Z
)-, and (all- 
E
)- rhodoxanthin, respectively. Furthermore, six minor compounds were assigned to rhodoxanthin isomers (
5
, 
6
, 
8
, 
9
, 
11
, 
14
) in accordance with a thermally isomerized reference standard (
Table 2
). All rhodoxanthin (
E/Z
)-isomers displayed protonated molecules [M + H] 
+
at 
m/z
563 using ESI positive ion mode. In the ESI(+)-MS 
2
experiment, the aforementioned compounds showed base peaks at 
m/z
359, as representatively illustrated in 
Fig. 2a
for (all- 
E
)-rhodoxanthin (
19
). Abundant product ions were detected at 
m/z
545 ([M + H 18] 
+
) and 
m/z
507 ([M + H 56] 
+
), presumably resulting from the loss of water and 
retro
- Diels Alder fragmentation, respectively. Moreover, ESI(+)-MS 
2
spectra revealed fragment ions at 
m/z
479 ([M + H 84] 
+
) that may derive from 
retro
-Diels Alder fragmentation (56 amu) and carbon monoxide elimination (28 amu). Further distinct product ions appeared at 
m/z
425, 389, 281, and 209. The abundant fragment ions at 
m/z
425 and 359 have been previously reported for rhodoxanthin (

). UV/vis spectra (see 
Table 2
and 
Fig. 3
) displayed main absorption maxima (
λ
max
) ranging from 
478 to 502 nm
across the rhodoxanthin (
E/Z
)-isomers assessed, being detected at 
502 nm
for (all- 
E
)-rhodoxanthin as well as at 494 and 
486 nm
for (6 
Z
)- and (6 
Z
,6 
′
Z
)-rhodoxanthin, respectively. Therefore, (
E
)- to (
Z
)-isomerization at the exocyclic double bonds of rhodoxanthin provoked hypsochromic shifts of 
8 nm
each compared to that of the (all- 
E
)-configured molecule, being in accordance with previous reports in addition to the characteristic elution order of those rhodoxanthin (
E/Z
)-isomers (

). Further absorption signals were detected at 
316–336 nm
across the rhodoxanthin (
E/Z
)-isomers assessed, resulting in a narrow range of DB/DII ratios (15–23%). Thus, no characteristic absorption bands in the near UV region, i.e., so-called (
Z
)-peaks (Britton, 1995), were obtained that would have supported the tentative assignment of (
Z
)-configured double bond positions at the inner polyene chain. Previously, it has been suggested on the basis of molecular modelling and steric considerations that preferred positions for the (
E/Z
)-isomerization at rhodoxanthin’ s inner polyene backbone might be the C-8,9 and C-12,13 double bonds (

).

) and ten esters (

have remained unknown. Heretofore, the dihydroxy-

<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus cuspidata
Siebold &amp; Zucc.
</tp:taxon-name>
(

). In our study, we substantiated the identification of (all- 
E
)-eschscholtzxanthin in the yellow arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Lutea’ by obtaining a reference compound from the petals of 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. californica
</tp:taxon-name>
that revealed matching retention times, UV/vis spectra, and MS data. Protonated molecules [M + H] 
+
at 
m/z
567 were detected at low abundance for most eschscholtzxanthin (
E/Z
)-isomers (
10
, 
15
, 
17
, 
20
, 
21
) in their ESI(+)-MS 
1
spectra, apart from the lacking signal for one minor geometrical isomer (
13
). Distinct in-source fragments at 
m/z
549 ([M + H – H O] 
+
) were obtained for the 
2
aforementioned peaks owing to spontaneous in-source elimination of water at C-3 (C-3 
′
) of the ε- rings (
Fig. 2d
), by analogy to that observed for (all- 
E
)-lutein as described above. In the ESI(+)-MS 
2
experiment (
Fig. 2b
), CID of the [M + H – H O] 
+
precursors resulted in fragment 
2
ions at 
m/z
531 ([M + H – 2 H O] 
+
), 
m/z
457 ([M + H – H O 92] 
+
), 
2 2
and 
m/z
439 ([M + H – 2 H O 92] 
+
) upon the loss of water and toluene 
2
elimination, being in accordance with previous reports (Andrewes et al., 1979; 

). The abundant product ions at 
m/z
475 ([M + H 2 H O 56] 
+
) and 
m/z
409 ([M + H 2 H O 122] 
+
) may be 
2 2
assigned to the loss of water and subsequent 
retro
-Diels-Alder fragmentation or cleavage of one of the two ε- rings, respectively. UV/vis spectra of eschscholtzxanthin (
E/Z
)-isomers (see 
Table 2
and 
Fig. 3
) revealed three distinct maxima at 
442–448 nm
, 
466–472 nm
(main 
λ
max
), and 
494–502 nm
(DIII), with the exception of one geometrical isomer (
17
) having a shoulder at 
498 nm
. For instance, (all- 
E
)-eschscholtzxanthin (
21
) showed absorption maxima at 448, 472, and 
502 nm
, being in accordance with the literature (Britton, 1995). In brief, UV/vis spectra of eschscholtzxanthin (
E/Z
)-isomers clearly differed from those of rhodoxanthin by displaying a pronounced fine structure of the absorption band, not being found for rhodoxanthin (
E/Z
)-isomers (
Fig. 3
).

2.1.2. 
HPLC-DAD-APCI-MSn
experiments of xanthophyll esters

</title>
         <p>
In addition to the above-described free carotenoids, several xanthophyll esters were assigned in our yew arils on the basis of comprehensive HPLC-DAD-APCI-MS 

n

data (
Table 3
), comprising fatty acyl moieties of 200, 228, and 256 amu that correspond to lauric, myristic, and palmitic acid, respectively. For instance, three esters of β- cryptoxanthin (
22
, 
23
, 
26
) were identified by comparing their retention times, UV/vis spectra, and MS data to those of reference peaks obtained from an extract of papaya flesh (
<tp:taxon-name>
Carica papaya
</tp:taxon-name>
L
.) and the respective literature (

). Compounds 
22
, 
23
, and 
26
displayed protonated molecules [M + H] 
+
at 
m/z
763 in
the APCI (+)-MS 
1
spectra. CID of the precursors (
m/z
763) yielded base peaks at 
m/z
535 ([M + H 228] 
+
) owing to the neutral loss of myristic acid. Further abundant product ions at 
m/z
671 ([M + H 92] 
+
), 
m/z
443 ([M + H – 228 92] 
+
), and 
m/z
413 ([M + H 228 122] 
+
) were in accordance with previous reports (

; 

), resulting in the assignment of the aforementioned peaks to β- cryptoxanthin myristates. However, their geometrical isomers may not be distinguished using MS 

n

fragmentation patterns. Therefore, we assigned the peaks 
23
and 
26
to the (all- 
E
)- and (9 
Z
)-configured molecules of β- cryptoxanthin myristate, respectively, on the basis of the elution order and UV/vis spectral shape resembling those of an isomerized reference standard of free β- cryptoxanthin (data not shown).

         <p>
Compounds 
24
, 
25
, 
27
, 
28b
, and 
30
were assigned to lutein esters according to their retention times as well as UV/vis and MS data compared to reference compounds obtained from marigold (
<tp:taxon-name>
Tagetes
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
) extract and literature data (

; Breithaupt et al., 2002). In the APCI() mode, molecular ions [M] 
•
were detected at 
m/z
960 (
25
), 
m/z
988 (
27
), and 
m/z
1016 (
30
), matching with those of (all- 
E
)-lutein laurate myristate, (all- 
E
)-lutein dimyristate, and (all- 
E
)--lutein myristate palmitate, respectively. In the APCI(+) mode, (all- 
E
)--lutein dimyristate (
27
) revealed a single in-source fragment at 
m/z
761 ([M + H – 228] 
+
) owing to the spontaneous loss of myristic acid at the ε- ring. By contrast, lutein heterodiesters (
25
, 
30
) revealed two distinct in-source fragments each, being detected at 
m/z
733 ([M + H – 228] 
+
) and 
m/z
761 ([M + H – 200] 
+
) for (all- 
E
)-lutein laurate myristate (
25
) and 
m/z
761 ([M + H – 256] 
+
) and 
m/z
789 ([M + H – 228] 
+
) for (all- 
E
)-lutein myristate palmitate (
30
) in accordance with the literature (

; 

; Breithaupt et al., 2002). Co-elution of regioisomers of lutein heterodiesters presumably hindered their differentiation in our chromatogram compared to a previous report of 

. In the APCI(+)-MS 
2
experiment, characteristic product ions were detected at 
m/z
533, 441, and 411, further substantiating the assignment of all compounds to lutein esters (
24
, 
25
, 
27
, 
28b
, 
30
). Moreover, UV/vis spectra (sh424, 446, and 
474 nm
) resembled that of (all- 
E
)-lutein (
2
), except for the absorption signal of compound 
28b
being overlaid by the unresolved eschscholtzxanthin myristate (
28a
).
</p>
         <p>
Compounds 
28a
, 
33
, 
35
, and 
37–43
were assigned to esters of eschscholtzxanthin according to their UV/vis spectra, MS data, elution order in the chromatogram (
t
R
), and the disappearance of respective peaks after saponification (
Table 3
and 
Fig. 1b
). Compound 
28a
was assigned to the monoester eschscholtzxanthin myristate. In the APCI(+) mode, we detected two in-source fragments at 
m/z
549 ([M + H – 228] 
+
) and 
m/z
759 ([M + H – H 
2
O] 
+
) due to the spontaneous cleavage of myristic acid and water, respectively (
Fig. 2d
). CID revealed distinct fragment ions at 
m/z
667 ([M + H – H 
2
O 92] 
+
) owing to toluene elimination. Moreover, characteristic product ions of eschscholtzxanthin were detected at 
m/z
531, 475, 439, and 409 as described above in more detail (c.f. 
Tables 2
and 
3
; see also 
Fig. 2b and c
). Compound 
33
was tentatively assigned to an isomer of eschscholtzxanthin laurate myristate according to the detection of two distinct in-source fragments at 
m/z
731 ([M + H 228] 
+
) and 
m/z
759 ([M + H – 200] 
+
) in the APCI (+)-MS 
1
spectrum. By analogy to the lutein heterodiesters described above (
25
, 
30
), we hypothesized that resonance-stabilized in-source fragments of eschscholtzxanthin monoesters have been formed upon the neutral loss of fatty acyl moieties at C-3 (C-3 
′
) of one of the two ε- rings. However, identifying eschscholtzxanthin diesters was specifically intricate because of this spontaneous in-source elimination of fatty acids, resulting in lacking signals of molecular ions [M] 
•
and protonated molecules [M + H] 
+
in the APCI negative and positive ion mode, respectively. In the APCI(+)-MS 
2
spectrum of compound 
33
, two respective product ions at 
m/z
639 ([M + H 228 92] 
+
) and 
m/z
667 ([M + H – 200 92] 
+
) appeared owing to the elimination of toluene and, therefore, further substantiated its identification as laurate myristate diester of eschscholtzxanthin. As a consequence of their elution after peak 
33
(
t
R
= 14.9 min), compounds 
35
and 
37–43
(
t
R
≥ 14.9 min) were also classified as diesters of eschscholtzxanthin. For the two most abundant eschscholtzxanthin diesters (
39
, 
42
), single in-source fragments at 
m/z
759 (M + H 228) were detected in the APCI(+)-MS 
1
spectra. Moreover, CID yielded typical fragment ions at 
m/z
667 ([M + H 228 92] 
+
) due to toluene elimination. Therefore, both compounds (
39
, 
42
) were tentatively assigned to (
E/Z
)-isomers of eschscholtzxanthin dimyristate.

Five eschscholtzxanthone esters (
29
, 
31
, 
32
, 
34
, 
36
) were identified in the red-colored arils (
Table 3
and 
Fig. 1a
). In the APCI(+)-MS 
1
experiment, in-source fragments at 
m/z
547 ([M + H fatty acid] 
+
) were detected at high abundance for all eschscholtzxanthone esters owing to the spontaneous in-source elimination of fatty acids as described above for eschscholtzxanthin esters. In addition, APCI()-MS 
1
experiments yielded signals at 
m/z
773 ([M H]) and 
m/z
774 ([M] 
•
) for the compounds 
32
and 
34
, thus being assigned to (
E/Z
)-isomers of eschscholtzxanthone myristate. Even though no distinct signals of the molecular ions were detected, compounds 
29
, 
31
, and 
36
were also classified as esters of eschscholtzxanthone on the basis of their presence before and absence after sample saponification. APCI(+)-MS 
2
experiments of the compounds 
29
, 
31
, 
32
, 
34
, and 
36
revealed fragment ions at 
m/z
491 ([M + H fatty acid 56] 
+
) and 
m/z
455 ([M + H fatty acid 92] 
+
) due to 
retro
-Diels-Alder fragmentation of the ε- ring and toluene elimination, respectively. Noteworthy, product ions at 
m/z
463 ([M + H fatty acid 84]) 
+
, possibly deriving from the fragmentation of the ε- ring carrying the oxo-group, were detected as observed during CID of rhodoxanthin. UV/vis spectra of the assigned eschscholtzxanthone esters did not exhibit a pronounced fine structure but rather single maxima ranging from 
478 to 486 nm
(see 
Table 3
and 
Fig. 3
), being a characteristic feature of carotenoids with conjugated oxo-groups in the molecular structure according to Chac´on-Ordo´˜nez et al. (2017) and Britton (1995).

2.2. Carotenoid quantitation by HPLC-DAD
</title>
         <p>
Carotenoid concentrations in μg/g fresh weight (fr. wt) of red- and yellow-colored arils of various defined cultivars of 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
and the interspecific hybrid 
<tp:taxon-name>
T.

are compiled in 
Tables 4
and 
5
, respectively. Overall, the hitherto unprecedented quantitation of carotenoids in yew arils revealed total concentrations of 17.00–58.78 μg/g fr. wt across all samples assessed. According to Britton and Khachik (2009), the aforementioned concentrations classify as high (5–20 μg/g fr. wt) to very high (
&gt;
20 μg/g fr. wt). Carotenoid concentrations of our yew arils were in the range of those reported earlier for various tropical crops, e.g., peach palm fruits (6.9–138.95 μg/g fr. wt), mamey sapote (37.86–80.76 μg/g fr. wt), and cashew apples (6.93–52.78 μg/g fr. wt) with differently colored flesh and peel (

; 

; Chacon-Ord´o´nez ˜et al., 2017). Furthermore, yew arils of our study exhibited higher carotenoid concentrations than those found in several other carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables like pineapple and sweet potato, being previously reported to contain 0.29–5.65 and 2.4–24.6 μg/g fr. wt, respectively (

; 

). Therefore, we characterized the arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
T.

media
</tp:taxon-name>
as rich source of carotenoids that is widely distributed in the Euro-Mediterranean region.
</p>
         <p>
Genuine carotenoid profiles of all red-colored arils were clearly dominated by rhodoxanthin (
E/Z
)-isomers, accumulating to a sum of 19.46–51.33 μg/g fr. wt (
Table 4
) and, therefore, representing a rhodoxanthin source with high to very high concentrations (Britton and Khachik, 2009). Rhodoxanthin accounted for strikingly high 87–99% of the total carotenoids across all red samples. Red arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T.

</tp:taxon-name>
‘Hicksii’ (51.33 ± 0.46 μg/g fr. wt) were characterized by significantly higher total rhodoxanthin concentrations than those of aril samples obtained from cultivars of

T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Elegantissima’, whereas (6

<tp:taxon-name>

1). Therefore, our study revealed that rhodoxanthin isomers with (
Z

Eschscholtzxanthone esters further contributed to the high concentration of

‘Hessei’ (2.55 ± 0.11 μg/g fr. wt) compared to those found in all other red-colored yew arils. Noteworthy, the cultivar ‘Dovastonii Aurea’ showed the lowest total carotenoid concentration (20.33 ± 0.51 μg/g fr. wt) but a significantly higher quantity of (all- 
E
)-lutein (0.56 ± 0.06 μg/g fr. wt) than those of the remaining red aril samples (0.17–0.25 μg/g fr. wt). In brief, carotenoid concentrations of red-colored arils differed remarkably between the cultivars of

Yellow-colored arils of the cultivar

‘Lutea’ were characterized by a clearly differing carotenoid profile compared to those of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus

and cultivars bearing red-colored arils, resulting in a distinctive morphological differentiating factor, i.e., the visual color appearance of yew arils (
<tp:taxon-name>c.f. arils</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Fig. 1a and b
). Total carotenoid concentrations of yellow arils ranged from 17.00 ± 0.52 to 19.55 ± 1.00 μg/g fr. wt, thus being significantly lower than those of red-colored arils with 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
‘Dovastonii
</tp:taxon-name>
Aurea’ (20.33 ± 0.51 μg/g fr. wt) being the exception. The latter showed that the apparent color difference between yellow- and red-colored arils may be primarily assigned to the carotenoid profiles rather than the total carotenoid concentration. In particular, when considering the bathochromic shifts of the UV/vis absorption spectra owing to stepwise dehydration of the hydroxy groups of eschscholtzxanthin (yellow arils) to eschscholtzxanthone and rhodoxanthin (red arils) and the resulting prolongation of the chromophore by up to two oxo-groups (
Fig. 3
).
</p>
         <p>
In the yellow-colored arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Lutea’, eschscholtzxanthin amounted in total to 14.83–17.36 μg/g fr. wt and, thus, accounted for 87–89% of the total carotenoids. So far, eschscholtzxanthin has been reported to be predominant in the petals of 
California
poppy (
<tp:taxon-name>
E. californica
</tp:taxon-name>
) with 32% of the total carotenoids (

). Free, i.e., non-esterified, (all- 
E
)-eschscholtzxanthin prevailed in our yellow-colored arils with concentrations of 5.73 ± 0.31 and 8.14 ± 0.41 μg/g fr. wt. Moreover, yellow arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Lutea’ abundantly contained eschscholtzxanthin isomers (2.58–2.61 μg/g fr. wt) and esters (6.49–6.64 μg/g fr. wt). In previous reports on 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. californica
</tp:taxon-name>
, biosynthetic pathways to eschscholtzxanthin have been proposed 
via
zeaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and a trihydroxy- 
retro
-carotenoid (

; 

). (all- 
E
)-Zeaxanthin was quantitated in our yellow-colored arils in small amounts (0.09–0.30 μg/g fr. wt), whereas antheraxanthin and the aforementioned trihydroxy- 
retro
-carotenoid were not detected as compared to an authentic reference standard and the extract from petals of 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. californica
</tp:taxon-name>
, respectively. However, the presence of such biosynthetic precursors of eschscholtzxanthin in the yellow arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Lutea’ cannot be excluded on the basis of the available data and might be elucidated by carotenoid profiling of aril samples at earlier maturity stages. By contrast, it was clearly shown that 
retro
-carotenoids featuring oxo-groups in their molecular structure, e.g., eschscholtzxanthone and rhodoxanthin, were not detected in the yellow arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Lutea’ (see section 2.1). Therefore, we hypothesized by reverse analogy, that rhodoxanthin synthase is either missing or apparently showing insufficient activity in the arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Lutea’. Hence, the tentative biosynthetic pathway from eschscholtzxanthin to eschscholtzxanthone and rhodoxanthin might be hampered in yellow-colored arils. This major difference in the carotenoid profile of our yew arils resulted in colors ranging from yellow and golden-orange for arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Lutea’ to bright red for those of the remaining yew trees assessed.

2.3. Light microscopy

         <p>
Light micrographs of fresh aril tissue of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Hessei’ and ‘Lutea’ both revealed cluster of small and round-shaped chromoplasts of red and yellow color, respectively (c.f. 
Fig. 4a and b
). The shapes of the chromoplasts of both red and yellow-colored yew arils were similar to those of mamey sapote pulp and goji berries (Chacon-Ord´o´nez ˜et al., 2016; 

), whereas elongated, needle-shaped, crystalline carotenoid structures were not observed as typically found in tomatoes and carrots (

). However, chromoplasts of yellow arils from 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Lutea’, predominantly containing (
E/Z
)-isomers and esters of eschscholtzxanthin instead of oxo- 
retro
-carotenoids like rhodoxanthin, appeared to be very luminescent using polarized light, while chromoplasts of red-fleshed arils did not show this phenomenon. These findings indicate that the respective carotenoids in yellow yew arils were deposited in the aril tissue in a highly ordered or even crystalline state. This highly ordered 
<tp:taxon-name>form might</tp:taxon-name>
comprise H-type aggregates that have been reported earlier for other dihydroxy-carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin, but might also comprise J-type aggregates as have been reported for xanthophyll esters (

). By contrast, polarized light microscopy revealed that the carotenoids present in the chromoplasts of our red-colored arils, i.e., mostly containing (
E/Z
)-isomers of rhodoxanthin and eschscholtzxanthone esters, were deposited presumably in a non-ordered or low-ordered state. In fundamental studies on the aggregation of rhodoxanthin, isomers with (
Z
)-configured double bonds at the inner polyene backbone have been reported to hamper aggregation at abundances of
&gt;
3% (

). In our red-colored arils, those rhodoxanthin isomers (
5
, 
6
, 
8
, 
9
, 
11
, 
14
) contributed to 6–15% of the total rhodoxanthin concentration and, therefore, their presence might explain the lacking luminescence of red chromoplasts under polarized light. However, further study is warranted because the currently available knowledge on deposition forms or aggregate 
types
of 
retro
--carotenoids like rhodoxanthin, eschscholtzxanthone, and eschscholtzxanthin is very scarce, in particular, in plant tissues.

3. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
Our study reports an in-depth carotenoid profiling of red- and yellow-colored arils of defined cultivars of two 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
, i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
and the interspecific hybrid 
<tp:taxon-name>
T.
× 
media
</tp:taxon-name>
. Carotenoid profiles of yew arils were dominated by exceptional 
retro
-carotenoids. In red-fleshed arils, we assigned nine rhodoxanthin (
E/Z
)-isomers and five eschscholtzxanthone esters. Rhodoxanthin (
E/Z
)-isomers amounted to a maximum of 51.33 ± 0.46 μg/g fr. wt, being predominantly represented by (all- 
E
)-, (6 
Z
)-, and (6 
Z
,6 
′
Z
)-rhodoxanthin in different ratios. By contrast, (
E/Z
)- isomers and esters of eschscholtzxanthin were the major pigments in the yellow-fleshed arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. baccata
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Lutea’. The high total carotenoid concentrations of 17.00–58.78 μg/g fr. wt across all samples assessed may support valorizing yew arils as promising source of carotenoids and, in particular, of 
retro
-carotenoids with exceptional molecular structures and extraordinary absorption properties. Although arils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
have historically been consumed by humans, non-toxicity and, thus, safety of yew aril consumption needs to be ensured prior to define efficient downstream processing for obtaining natural carotenoid extracts from yew arils. Further insights into the ultrastructure of yew aril plastids and the deposition of carotenoids might be elucidated in continuative studies using transmission electron microscopy and 
in vitro
digestion models as established previously for other plant tissues (

; Chac´on-Ordo´nez ˜et al., 2016). Moreover, chemotaxonomic chromoplast characterization beyond carotenoid profiles might be used as additional marker to substantiate the differentiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Taxus
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
as has been reported by 

on the basis of e.g., chloroplast genotyping and fingerprinting of deoxyribonucleic acid.

4.5. Carotenoid identification by HPLC-DAD-ESI/APCI-MS 
n
analyses

</title>
         <p>
For compound identification, we pooled several extracts of red- and yellow-colored arils, respectively. In case that saponification was deemed appropriate, we followed the protocol as reported by Schex et al. (2018). Briefly, the dried extracts were re-dissolved in 2 mL diethyl ether and 2 mL methanolic potassium hydroxide (10%, 
w/v
), flushed with nitrogen, and saponified for 3 h under continuous stirring and light exclusion. After washing the saponified extracts twice with 2 mL water, the organic phases were collected, evaporated to dryness using a gentle nitrogen stream, and re-dissolved for 
HPLC
analyses as described in section 4.4.
</p>
         <p>
A Thermo Fisher Accela 
HPLC
series was equipped with a diode array detector and coupled to a LXQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, 
USA
). The injection volume was 20 μL. Carotenoids were chromatographically separated at 23

on a 
C

μ

; eluent B, 20:78:2, 
v

). Following elution gradient was applied at a constant flow rate of 0.5 mL/min: Isocratic at 100% A (1 min), 100% to 0% A (12 min), isocratic hold at 0% A (3 min), 0% to 100% A (0.1 min), isocratic at 100% A (4.9 min). Total run time was 21 min. UV/vis absorption spectra were recorded at 
270–800 nm
. Ratios of DIII/DII (%) and DB/DII (%) were determined according to Britton (1995).

         <p>
The extraction work-up was conducted under reduced light exposure to inhibit carotenoid isomerization and degradation. The frozen arils were separated manually from the seeds and homogenized using a Polytron PT 1300 D disperser (Kinematica, 
Lucerne
, 
Switzerland
) at 15 000 rpm for 2.5 min. Each aril puree was analyzed in duplicate. Aliquots of 320 ± 
40 mg
and ca. 
50 mg
calcium carbonate were mixed with 2 mL of a mixture of methanol/ethyl acetate/ 
n
-hexane (1:1:1, 
v/v/v
) containing 
0.2 g
/L butylated hydroxytoluene as antioxidant. Carotenoids were extracted for 10 min in an ice-cooled ultrasonic bath. After adding 1 mL water, samples were centrifuged and the organic phases were collected. The remainders were re-extracted 2–3 times using 1 mL of the aforementioned extraction solvent in the ultrasonic bath for 5 min. Organic phases were collected, evaporated to dryness using a gentle nitrogen stream, and stored at 20 
◦
C until further analyses. For HPLC analyses, dried extracts were re-dissolved in 
t
BME/methanol (1:1, 
v/v
), membrane-filtered (polytetrafluoroethylene, 0.45 μm, Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI, 
USA
), and filled into amber glass vials.
</p>
         <p>
Carotenoids were extracted as described in section 4.4 and quantitated using an Agilent series 1100 
HPLC
system coupled to a G1315A DAD (Agilent, Waldbronn, 
Germany
) and the above-described chromatographic conditions. The injection volume was 10 μL. Linear calibration curves of (all-

; R 
2
= 0.99995) were used for quantitation. Stock solution concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using molar extinction coefficients as reported by Britton (1995). A scan range of 
210–700 nm
was used to record UV/vis spectra. Rhodoxanthin (
E/Z
)-isomers were monitored at 488, 496, and 
504 nm
. Eschscholtzxanthone esters were detected at 475 and 
488 nm
, being quantitated using the rhodoxanthin calibration. Eschscholtzxanthin (
E/Z

475 nm
. All other carotenoids including their esters were monitored at 
450 nm
. β- Cryptoxanthin, eschscholtzxanthin, lutein, and violaxanthin as well as respective geometrical isomers and esters were quantitated using the calibration curve of (all-
