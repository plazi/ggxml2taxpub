The effects of germination and elicitation on (iso)flavonoid composition of extracts from three edible lupine species (
<tp:taxon-name>
Lupinus luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lupinus albus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lupinus angustifolius
</tp:taxon-name>
) were determined by RP-UHPLC– 
MS
n

. The total (iso)flavonoid content of lupine increased over 10-fold upon germination, with the total content and composition of isoflavonoids more affected than those of flavonoids. Glycosylated isoflavones were the most predominant compounds found in lupine seedlings. Lesser amounts of isoflavone aglycones, including prenylated ones, were also accumulated. Elicitation with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhizopus oryzae
</tp:taxon-name>
, in addition to germination, raised the content of isoflavonoids further: the total content of 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives was increased considerably, without increasing that of genistein derivatives. Elicitation by fungus triggered prenylation of isoflavonoids, especially of the 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives. The preferred positions of prenylation differed among the three lupine species. The change in isoflavone composition increased the agonistic activity of the extracts towards the human estrogen receptors, whereas no antagonistic activity was observed.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Isoflavonoids have been associated with several health-promoting effects, including reduced risks of various cancers and alleviating effects of hormone replacement therapy (

; 

; 

). These effects are (partially) exerted by binding of isoflavonoids to human estrogen receptors (hER) (

). Previously, we have developed an effective method to elevate the isoflavonoid content of soybeans by performing germination and fungal elicitation simultaneously (

). The treatment increased the total isoflavonoid content of soybeans by up to 2-fold, accompanied by compositional changes. The total amount of prenylated isoflavonoids was boosted up to 13-fold. As a result, up to 50% (wt/wt) of total isoflavonoids were prenylated pterocarpans, i.e. glyceollins (

). Glyceollin I, a major prenylated pterocarpan in elicited soybean, has been suggested as a novel therapeutic agent for hormone dependent tumors (

).

Lupine (
<tp:taxon-name>
Lupinus
</tp:taxon-name>
) is a genus of the legume family, consisting of around 200–400 species (

). Contrary to most genera of legumes, roots and leaves of lupine can produce a variety of prenylated isoflavonoids in addition to glycosylated ones and aglycones (

; 

). Further investigation on the ability of lupine to generate defense metabolites upon stress showed that lupine failed to induce isoflavonoids other than the constitutive ones (

). Nevertheless, it has been observed that the isoflavonoid content of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lupinus angustifolius
</tp:taxon-name>
can be boosted in response to fungal infection (

). Moreover, fungal infection is known to increase the ratio of aglycones to glycosylated isoflavonoids of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lupinus albus
</tp:taxon-name>
, which was linked to an increase of β- glucosidase activity (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Contrary to studies on the content of isoflavonoids in leaf and root parts, the induction of isoflavonoids in lupine seedlings has not been extensively investigated. Furthermore, most studies focused on aglycones (

). Additional to soybean, germinated or elicited lupine seeds might be a source of bioactive isoflavonoids. Hence, in the present study, the seeds of three edible lupine species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lupinus luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L
. 
albus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L
. 
angustifolius
</tp:taxon-name>
, were subjected to the process of simultaneous germination and elicitation by fungus, which has been successfully applied to soybean seeds previously (

; 

,b). It is hypothesized that isoflavonoid content and molecular diversity of isoflavonoids in lupine seedlings, as well as the estrogenic potential of lupine seedling extracts, will change upon the treatment. Thereby, it will provide novel lead molecules for therapeutic purposes when compared to extracts obtained from soybean seedlings. The compositional changes during treatment were monitored by LC– 
MS
/ 
MS
analysis with emphasis on prenylated isoflavonoids. For this, the current diagnostic tools for characterizing prenylation of isoflavonoids in complex extracts were extended using 
MS
/ 
MS
fragmentation data (

; 

;

2.1. Chromatographic profiling of different lupine extracts
</title>
         <p>
UHPLC-UV analysis of the

extract showed that the extract from untreated seeds contained only a single peak (
Fig. 1A
), whereas both germination and elicitation by fungus generated an array of compounds (
Fig. 1B and C
). The untreated seeds of two other

contained two peaks, one of which was eluted at the same retention time as that of 
<tp:taxon-name>

(data not shown). Both other species showed a similar response to the treatments (germination and elicitation) as 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
, although they accumulated different sets of compounds (
Fig. 1D and E
). In total, sixty-one peaks were used for further analysis. Within each chromatogram, the peaks analyzed represented more than 95% of the total UV response at 
260 nm
of the chromatogram. The (iso)flavonoids tentatively annotated belonged to the flavone, flavanone, isoflavone and coumaronochromone subclasses. The molecules were present in aglyconic, glycosylated and prenylated forms. The annotation of aglycones and glycosylated derivatives was based on comparison of spectral data obtained from UHPLC-UV– ESI-MS/ 
MS
(including fragmentation patterns) (
Table S1
) with literature data (

2.2. C- and O-glycosides of (iso)flavonoids
</title>
         <p>
Twenty-seven non-prenylated (iso)flavonoids glycosides were tentatively annotated in treated 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lupinus
</tp:taxon-name>
, comprising the flavone, flavanone and isoflavone subclasses. The different subclasses were discriminated on the basis of UV absorption. Typical 
ƛ
max
values of 270 (±5) and 
330–365 nm
for flavones, 290 (±5) nm for flavanones, and 260 (±5) nm for isoflavones were observed (

). The glycosylated derivatives had one to three glycosyl residues, some of which were malonylated. The glycosyl residues found previously in lupine were mainly glucosyl, xylosyl, and rhamnosyl, attached to hydroxyl groups or directly to a 

C

-atom (

). In the present study, the 

C

- and 
O
- glycosylated (iso)flavonoids were distinguished by their characteristic fragmentation patterns resulting from the cleavage of the sugar moieties in 
MS
2
(

, 

). Neutral losses of 162/146/132 Da are ascribed to 
O
-glucoside/ 
O
-rhamnoside/ 
O
-xyloside residues, respectively, whereas neutral losses of 90 and 120 Da are ascribed to 

C

-glucosides of (iso)flavonoids in PI or NI mode (

; 

, 

). Moreover, neutral losses of 150/164/180 Da in NI mode are attributed to 
O

C

-glucosyl(iso)flavonoids, respectively (

). 
A
high relative abundance of these neutral losses was ascribed to the attachment of one of these glycosyl residues at the 
200
-OH of the 

C

-glucosyl residue (

). In addition, a malonyl group was identified by neutral losses of 44 or 86 Da, in NI or PI mode, respectively (

2.3. Prenyl configuration of isoflavonoids in extracts of lupine seedlings
</title>
         <p>
Twenty-five prenylated isoflavonoids were found in treated lupines, including prenylated isoflavonoid glycosides. The UV spectra indicated that most of the prenylated derivatives were isoflavones. Two compounds were tentatively annotated as prenylated coumaronochromones (
58
and 
59
), which were distinguished from isoflavones by their UV spectrum, exhibiting 
ƛ
max
values of around 257 (±2), 284 (±2) (
sh
), and 338 (±3) nm (

). The prenyl group can be attached in different configurations to the A- and/or B-rings (
Table 1
). 
A
neutral loss of 56 Da (
C
4
H 
8
) was used to distinguish a prenyl chain from a ring-closed prenyl in PI mode (

; 

). Major neutral losses of 42 Da (
C
3
H 
6
) and, to a lesser extent, 60 Da (
C
3
H 
6
+ H 
2
O), 54 Da (
C
4
H 
6
) and 15 Da (
CH
.
3
) were used to annotate both 2,2-dimethylpyran and 2-isopropenyldihydrofuran rings (

). Neutral losses of 18 Da (H 
2
O) and 72 Da (
C
4
H 
8
O) were indicative of a 2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-dihydrofuran ring (

). Based on these neutral losses, peaks 
41
, 
45
, 
47
, 
51–55
and 
57–59
were classified as prenyl chain isoflavonoid derivatives. It was impossible to distinguish between isoflavonoid isomers with a pyran or furan substituent by mass spectrometry, as both of them provided almost the same fragmentation patterns. Nevertheless, these isomers were tentatively annotated on the basis of the literature, accounting for their elution behavior, their UV maxima, and their abundance in previous studies (

; 

; 

, 

, 

, 

). Peaks 
42
and 
48–50
were assigned as 2,2-dimethylpyran isoflavonoids, whereas 
33
and 
46
were assigned as 2-isopropenyl dihydrofuran and 2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-dihydrofuran isoflavonoid, respectively. Moreover, lupine generated diprenylated isoflavonoids as well. The fragmentation behavior of diprenylated isoflavonoid was similar to that of monoprenylated isoflavonoid, only the diagnostic losses occurred twice: in 
MS
2
and 
MS
3
(

). As a result, peaks 
56
and 
61
were annotated as isoflavonoids containing two prenyl chains, whereas peak 
60
was assigned as an isoflavonoid containing a prenyl chain and a pyran-ring. In addition, five out of twenty-five prenylated isoflavonoids were in 
O
-glycosylated form (peaks 
13
, 
26
, 
30
, 
34
, and 
35
), no 

C

-glycosylated 
<tp:taxon-name>form was</tp:taxon-name>
found. This is consistent with the fact that prenylation and 

C

-glycosylation can occur at the same positions. The 
type
of prenyl attached to these glycosides of prenylated isoflavonoids can be determined from fragmentation of the aglycone product ions in either in 
MS
3
or 
MS
4
. As a result, all glycosides of prenylated isoflavonoids were annotated as isoflavonoids containing a prenyl chain.

2.4. A- or B-ring prenylation in isoflavonoids
</title>
         <p>
Analysis of 
retro
-Diels-Alder (RDA) fragment ions in PI mode from isoflavone isomers was used to determine the position of the prenyl substituent (A- or B-ring) (

). RDA fragments diagnostic for A- or B-ring prenylation with a prenyl chain were obtained upon fragmentation of the ion [M+H— 
C
4
H 
8
] 
+
in 
MS
3
(
Fig. 2A and B
). The diagnostic fragments

C

H 
8
and 
1,3
B
+
- 
C

H

still contained one carbon reminiscent of the prenyl chain (

; 

). This fragmentation behavior was confirmed with two authentic standards (2,3-dehydrokievitone (isoflavone with A-ring chain prenylation) and licoisoflavone 
A
(isoflavone with B-ring chain prenylation)), which corresponded to compound 
45
and 
51
, respectively, in our extracts. On the other hand, RDA fragmentation of isoflavones with a ring-closed prenyl moiety mostly occurred upon 
MS
2
fragmentation of the parent ion with the prenyl substituent still intact, yielding the diagnostic 
1,3
A
+
and 
1,3
B
+
RDA fragments (
Fig. 2C
). As a result, it is concluded that all monoprenylated isoflavones were A-ring prenylated, except 
35
, 
50
, 
51
and 
53
that were B-ring prenylated. Similarly, RDA fragmentation of diprenylated isoflavones with two chains was obtained upon fragmentation of the ion [M+H—2 
C
4
H 
8
] 
+
in 
MS
4
, whereas RDA fragmentation of diprenylated isoflavones with a chain and a ring-closed was performed on the [M+H— 
C
4
H 
8
] 
+
ion in 
MS
3
. As a consequence, peak 
56
was annotated as diprenylated isoflavone with two A-ring prenyl chains, whereas peaks 
60
and 
61
were annotated as diprenylated isoflavones with an A-ring prenyl chain plus a B-ring ring-closed prenyl, and with an A-ring plus B-ring prenyl chain, respectively.
</p>
         <p>
Different to prenylated isoflavones, two prenylated coumaronochromones (
58
and 
59
) showed almost no RDA fragmentation. This observation was different to a previous report showing that RDA fragmentation of some monoprenylated coumaronochromones occurred at positions 0/4, albeit with low relative intensity (&lt;1–10%). Nevertheless, our observation corresponded with the fragmentation behavior of other prenylated coumaronochromones, such as lupinalbin D and E, that did not show RDA fragmentation in that study (

). Hence, the prenyl positions of coumaronochromones were not determined.

As no authentic standards of isoflavones with A-ring ring-closed prenyl substituents were available, the position of the prenyl substituent has been extrapolated from the fragmentation behavior of flavones, which are similar to isoflavones in C-ring structure.

2.5. Position of prenylation within the A-ring of isoflavones
</title>
         <p>
With respect to A-ring prenylation, two positional isomers are possible, i.e. attachment of the prenyl substituent to the 

C

-6 or to the 

C

-8 position. We investigated the fragmentation behavior of two authentic standards, wighteone and lupiwighteone, which are chain-prenylated at 

C

-6 and 

C

-8, respectively. In PI mode 
MS
2
, both compounds produced [M+H— 
C
4
H 
8
] 
+
with 
m
/ 
z
283 at similar relative intensities. In 
MS
3
, the [M+H— 
C
4
H 
8
] 
+
ion of the two compounds fragmented differently. The 

C

-8 prenylated isoflavone (lupiwighteone) almost exclusively yielded a fragment ion with a neutral loss of 42 Da (
C
2
H 
2
O), whereas the 

C

-6 prenylated isoflavone (wighteone) gave that fragment ion with less than 1% relative intensity (
Fig. 3
). Therefore, we considered the fragment ion [M+H— 
C
4
H 
8
— 
C
2
H 
2
O] 
+
in 
MS
3
diagnostic for distinguishing 

C

- 6 and 

C

-8 chain-prenylation. This principle, delineated from the fragmentation behavior of the two authentic standards, was applied to the extracts of elicited lupine seedlings. As a result, peaks 
47
, 
54
, 
55
and 
60
were classified as 

C

-6 chain-prenylated isoflavones, whereas 
41
, 
45
, 
52
, 
57
and 
61
were classified as 

C

-8 chain-prenylated isoflavones. For glycosides of prenylated isoflavones, the fragmentations of the aglycone product ions in 
MS
3
or 
MS
4
of PI mode were compared to their respective prenylated isoflavone and used to determine the chain-prenyl position. Accordingly, peaks 
13
, 
26
, 
30
and 
34
were classified as 

C

-6 chain-prenylated isoflavones.
</p>
         <p>
As for the position of ring-closed prenylation (pyran, furan), it was observed that the neutral loss of 54 Da in either PI mode 
MS
2
or 
MS
3
was found in relatively high abundance (intensity of [M+H—54] 
+
&gt; 20%) with some molecules and in lower abundance (intensity of [M+H—54] 
+
&lt;5%) with others, putatively diagnostic for 

C

-6 or 

C

-8 ring-closed prenylation, respectively. Similar observations were done before for closed-ring prenylated flavones/flavonols, which are similar to isoflavones with respect to C-ring configuration (

). Consequently, peaks 
33
, 
46
and 
49
were tentatively annotated as 

C

-6 ring-closed prenylated isoflavones, whereas peaks 
42
and 
48
were tentatively annotated as 

C

-8 ring-closed prenylated isoflavones.

2.6. Content and composition of (iso)flavonoids of lupine seedlings
</title>
         <p>
The (iso)flavonoid profiles of the three 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lupinus
species
</tp:taxon-name>
changed extensively upon germination. The total flavonoid and isoflavonoid content increased from 0.28 ± 0.04–0.46 ± 0.04 to 4.11 ± 0.41– 5.27 ± 
0.25 mg
genistein equivalents per gram dry weight (mg GE/g DW), dominated by glycosylated derivatives, which accounted for up to 90% (wt/wt) of total (iso)flavonoids (Table S2). 
A
more than 300-fold increase was observed for total isoflavonoid content, whereas only up to a 3-fold increase was noted for total flavonoid content. The total isoflavonoid content reached up to 3.45 ± 0.21–4.85 ± 
0.20 mg
GE/g DW. Isoflavone was the predominant isoflavonoid subclass found in lupine seedlings, mainly consisting of genistein derivatives and smaller amounts of 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives. The genistein derivatives were dominated by their glycosylated forms, up to 90% (wt/ wt). Typically, 
O
-glycosylated isoflavones were accumulated in all lupine seedlings, whereas 

C

-glycosylated isoflavones were absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
seedlings.
</p>
         <p>
The total flavonoid content increased after germination, from 0.27 ± 0.04–0.45 ± 0.04 to 0.42 ± 0.05–1.08 ± 
0.04 mg
GE/g DW, mainly caused by accumulation of glycosylated compounds (more than 95% (wt/wt) of total flavonoids) (Table S2). Flavone and, to a lesser extent, flavanone were the main flavonoid subclasses found in lupine seedlings, with 

C

-glycosylated apigenin derivatives as the predominant compounds. Small amounts of flavonoid aglycones were found in lupine seedlings, prenylated flavonoids were not detected.

         <p>

2.7. Content and composition of (iso)flavonoids of elicited lupine 
seedlings
</p>
         <p>
Compared to the lupine seedlings, the total flavonoid and isoflavonoid content of elicited lupine increased from 4.11 ± 0.41– 5.27 ± 0.25 up to 5.99 ± 1.09–8.78 ± 
0.22 mg
GE/g DW 
(
Table S2). This was caused by the accumulation of isoflavonoids, particularly isoflavones, as the flavonoid content was not considerably altered. The fungal elicitation modified the total content and relative abundance of the group of genistein derivatives and the group of 
20
- hydroxygenistein derivatives, to different extents. The total content of 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives of elicited lupine seedlings increased 6–20 times compared to that in non-elicited lupine seedlings, whereas the total amount of genistein derivatives remained the same. Nevertheless, the relative abundance of genistein derivatives changed during fungal elicitation just as that of the 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives. The content of 
O
-glycosylated genistein derivatives decreased, coinciding with the increase of genistein aglycone (Table S2). It is worth noting that no decrease in the amount of 

C

-glycosylated genistein derivatives was detected.
</p>
         <p>
The change in the total content and relative abundance of isoflavones was different among the three lupine species. The increase in total amount of 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
was much more pronounced than that in the two other species. Surprisingly, the level of prenylated 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives was almost the same in all species. The decrease in the content of 
O
-glycosylated genistein derivatives was higher in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
than in the other species. As a result, the elicited 
<tp:taxon-name>

The extracts from elicited lupine seedlings that were free from alkaloids were tested for the estrogenic activity towards ERoi or ERβ Results were expressed with the 
DMSO
control set to 0% and 0.2 nM 17β- estradiol set to 100% (
Figs. 4

Fig. 4

was fractionated using Flash chromatography. All fractions were analyzed by 
UHPLC
– 
MS
. Two pools enriched in either prenylated genistein or prenylated 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives were made based on the compositional analysis. The pool of prenylated genistein derivatives mainly consisted of wighteone (29%), whereas the pool of prenylated 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives mainly consisted of luteone (32%) and 2,3-dehydrokievitone (25%) (Table S3). The two pools were tested for (anti)estrogenic activity towards ERoi or ERβ. The pool of prenylated 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives showed a ~70-fold higher estrogenic activity towards ERβ than that of prenylated genistein derivatives (
Fig. 5B
). The estrogenic activity of prenylated 
20
- hydroxygenistein derivatives towards ERoi was ~100-fold lower than that towards ERβ, whereas no estrogenic activity of prenylated genistein derivatives towards ERoi was observed at the concentrations tested (
Fig. 5A

3. Discussion and conclusions
</title>
         <p>Germination alone or in combination with elicitation by fungus altered the total content and composition of (iso)flavonoids in seed(ling)s of the three lupine species studied. The total content of (iso)flavonoids increased after 7 days of germination, and increased further when the germination was performed in the presence of fungus. During the treatments, isoflavonoids appeared much more inducible than flavonoids, and the compositional changes in isoflavonoids were species-dependent. Moreover, these compositional changes affected the estrogenic activity of the extracts from the elicited lupine seedlings.</p>

3.1. Elicitation of seedlings by fungus induces accumulation of particularly 2
0
-hydroxygenistein derivatives
</p>
         <p>
Elicitation by fungus increased the total content of 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives of lupine seedlings, whereas no such increase was observed for that of genistein derivatives (
Fig. 6
). The accumulation of the 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives was most prominent with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
, whereas the other two lupine species showed a twofold lower increase. The pool of 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives did not seem to grow at the expense of that of genistein derivatives during elicitation, suggesting 
de novo
synthesis of these isoflavonoids. Nevertheless, compositional changes in the pool of genistein derivatives occurred, i.e. due to deglycosylation of the 
O
-glycosides and, to lesser extent, to prenylation. It has previously been shown that elicitation by fungus increased β- glucosidase activity, evidenced by a higher amount of aglycones, which is in line with our results (

; 

). The higher β- glucosidase activity in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
than in the other two species is in accordance with a previous report stating that the increase of β- glucosidase activity in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
leaves after infection with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pleiochaeta setosa
</tp:taxon-name>
was higher than that in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. angustifolius
(

)
</tp:taxon-name>
. No β- glucosidase activity in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
has been reported. As expected, the amount of isoflavone 

C

-glycosides remained constant, as β- glucosidase is not known to cleave carbon–carbon linkages.

3.2. Prenylation features in three lupine species compared
</title>
         <p>
Accumulation of prenylated isoflavones was more pronounced during elicitation when compared to germination. Except in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. angustifolius
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
20
-hydroxygenistein seemed to be the preferred substrate for prenyltransferases (
Fig. 7
), as prenylated 
20
-hydroxygenistein was more abundant in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
than prenylated genistein, despite the lower abundance of its respective unprenylated precursor. This is consistent with the fact that the isoflavonoid prenyltransferase 
LaPT1
isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
is 20% more active towards 
20
-hydroxygenistein than towards genistein (

), although no such data were available for isoflavone prenyltransferase from either 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. angustifolius
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
. It might be speculated that the prenyltransferase(s) from 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. angustifolius
</tp:taxon-name>
are more promiscuous with respect to their acceptor substrates (genistein and 
20
-hydroxygenistein) than that (those) of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
Another interesting finding was that the pattern of isoflavonoid prenylation differed among the three lupine species (
Fig. 7
). 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. angustifolius
</tp:taxon-name>
isoflavones had the most versatile prenylation pattern, with 

C

-6: 

C

-8:C- 
30
equalling 7:1:2 and 1:1:2, for prenylated genistein and 
20
-hydroxygenistein, respectively. With 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
, prenylation seemed to be more specific with one (mainly 

C

-6) or two (

C

-6, and to a lesser extent 

C

-8) preferred positions for prenylation, respectively. From various reports on 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
in the literature, it might be deduced that each of the three positions for attachment of a prenyl chain requires a distinct prenyltransferase (

; 

). Our results also hint at specific prenyltransferases for each position, the expression of which seems to be lupine species-dependent. Nevertheless, in-depth biochemical characterization of these prenyltransferases is required to establish such region-specificity further.
</p>
         <p>
Besides the position of prenylation, also the extent of the different kinds of prenylation varied among the three lupine species. The ratio of chain:pyran:furan prenylation was approximately 13:3:1 for 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 1:0:0 for 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. angustifoliu
</tp:taxon-name>
s, and 4:0:1 for 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
. This suggests that the occurrence of cyclization reactions subsequent to the actual prenylation step can differ among the three species.

3.3. Accumulation of phytoestrogens during elicitation of seedlings by 
fungus
</p>
         <p>
The estrogenic activity of extracts from lupine seed(ling)s increased after elicitation by fungus. The 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
extract displayed the highest estrogenic activity on both estrogen receptors, followed by the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
and the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. angustifolius
</tp:taxon-name>
extracts. The 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. albus
</tp:taxon-name>
extract contained the largest amount of aglycones (
Fig. 6
), i.e. genistein and 
20
-hydroxygenistein, which might explain its higher estrogenic activity (

; 

). Nevertheless, the relationship of estrogenic potential of the extracts and their isoflavonoid composition might be more complex than proportion of aglycones. The prenylation pattern of isoflavonoids differed between extracts, and it is not unlikely that this influences the estrogenic activity (

). Besides, 

C

-glycosylated isoflavonoids (e.g. puerarin) are known to have estrogenic activity (

), but it is unknown whether this also holds for the isoflavonoid 

C

-glycosides from lupine. More in-depth studies with purified compounds are required to establish this further.
</p>
         <p>
This study showed that the process of simultaneous germination and elicitation with fungus, successful in inducing estrogenic isoflavonoids in soybean seedlings, can be extrapolated to lupine seedlings for similar purpose. The estrogenic activity of extracts from lupine and soybean seedlings was comparable. Nevertheless, the set of molecules induced in elicited lupine seedlings differed from that in elicited soybean seedlings. In lupine, the biosynthesis of isoflavonoids comes to a hold at a relatively early stage, i.e. 
20
- hydroxygenistein, whereas that of elicited soybeans continues to 6a-hydroxypterocarpans and coumestans (

; 

). Besides different skeletons (and therewith planarity), also the prenylation patterns between lupine and soybean are different, in that lupine showed more chain prenylation than soybean (pyran and single prenyl). Therefore, prenylated isoflavonoids from lupine might be an interesting complementary set of molecules to those from soybean in studying modulation of estrogenic responses. In this respect, it is required to determine EC 
50
and IC 
50
values of purified molecules in different bioassays (e.g. yeast assay used in this study, and MCF-7 cells), in order to determine whether the molecules show agonistic, antagonistic or SERM behavior (

).

4.2. Lupine seed treatments
</title>
         <p>
The treatment of lupine seeds was performed in an EQMM sprouting machine (EasyGreen, San Diego, CA, 
USA
), which was modified as described previously (

). The seeds were sequentially subjected to a soaking (1 d) and a germination (7 d) stage. Prior to soaking, seeds were surface-sterilized by immersing them in a 1% (wt/vol) hypochlorite solution (5 L/kg beans) for 10 min at room temperature and subsequently rinsed 4 times with Milli-Q water (3 L/kg beans). The sterilized seeds were soaked for 24 h at 25 ° 
C
in sterilized Milli-Q water. Subsequently, the soaked seeds were transferred into plastic cartridges (sterilized by soaking them in hypochlorite 1% (vol/vol) for 2 h, and subsequently rinsing them with Milli-Q water), which were then placed in the sprouting machine. Prior to this, the machine was sterilized according to the cleaning protocol provided by the manufacturer. The lupine seeds were germinated for 7 d at 25 ° 
C
and 100% RH. In another set of sprouting experiments, the lupine seeds were also subjected to fungal elicitation. 
A
spore suspension (0.2 mL/g beans) was added to the seeds after 2 d of germination. Spore suspensions for the inoculation stage were prepared from pure plate cultures of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. oryzae
</tp:taxon-name>
grown on malt extract agar (CM59; Oxoid, Basingstoke, 
UK
). The sporangia were scraped off from the agar plate and suspended in a 0.85% (wt/ vol) NaCl solution (10 
7
CFU/mL). The fungus-elicited seeds were incubated for 5 d at 30 ° 
C
and a RH controlled at 55–85%. The seeds were collected after the treatment and directly stored at —20 ° 
C
. All the experiments were performed in duplicate.

4.3. Extraction of (iso)flavonoids from lupine seeds
</title>
         <p>
The extracts of untreated and treated lupine seeds were prepared as described previously for soybean (

), with the modification that 80% (vol/vol) aqueous methanol (MeOH) was used for extraction of (iso)flavonoids from lupine. For (iso)flavonoid profiling of the lupine, the dried extracts were re-solubilized in 80% (vol/vol) aqueous methanol to a concentration of 
5 mg
/mL and subjected to LC– 
MS
/ 
MS
analysis. Prior to the estrogenic activity assay, alkaloids were removed from the dried extracts by solid phase extraction (SPE), because lupine is known to contain alkaloids of the quinolizidine group that showed 
in vivo
estrogenic activity in rats (

; 

). The SPE was performed on a cation-exchange column (Supelclean LC-SCX, 
500 mg
, Sigma– Aldrich) according to a procedure described elsewhere (

), with the exception that the extract was solubilized in 0.05 M HCl instead of water. The extracts were solubilized to a concentration of 
20 mg
/mL. Prior to sample application, the column was pre-conditioned using 5 mL methanol followed by 5 mL water. Samples (2 mL) were percolated through the columns. After washing with water (5 mL), the column was eluted with methanol (5 mL), followed by 2 M ammonium in methanol (10 mL). Both methanol and ammoniated methanol fractions were collected and subsequently evaporated under reduced pressure. The dried fractions were resolubilized to the required concentration in 80% (vol/vol) aqueous methanol (LC– 
MS
/ 
MS
analysis) or 
DMSO
(estrogenicity assay). All samples were centrifuged (

18,000 
g

         <p>
The fungal elicitation process of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. angustifolius
</tp:taxon-name>
was scaled up in a two-tank steep germinator (Custom Laboratory Products, Keith, 
UK
). The elicitation process of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. angustifolius
</tp:taxon-name>
consisted of the same steps as described for the sprouting machine. The soaking step was performed at 22 °C, involving three subsequent steps: 6 h immersing in water, 12 h resting in humid air and 6 h immersing in water. The germination step was performed at 22 °C and a humidity of 95–98%, whereas the elicitation with fungus was performed at 30 °C and a humidity of 70–90%. The elicited 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. angustifolius
</tp:taxon-name>
seedlings were freeze-dried and milled (Retsch Ultra Centrifugal Mill ZM 200; Haan, 
Germany
). The dried powder was extracted with 80% (vol/vol) aqueous methanol with ratio 1:20 (wt/vol) under influence of sonication at 40 °C for 30 min. The extract was evaporated under reduced pressure and then freeze-dried. A Reveleris Flash system (Grace, Deerfield, IL, 
USA
) was used to obtain fractions enriched in prenylated genistein and prenylated 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives. To this end, dry extract (
250 mg
) was mixed with 
1.2 g
of silica gel. The mixture was transferred into an empty 
5 g
cartridge and closed with a plunger. The cartridge was placed upstream of a 
12 g
Reveleris C18 RP column (particle size 38.6 µm) (Grace Davison Discovery Science, Columbia, MD, 
USA
). Water (Milli-Q) acidified with 1% (vol/vol) HOAc (HPLC grade) + 1% (vol/vol) ACN (HPLC grade), eluent A, and methanol (HPLCgrade), eluent B, were used as eluents. The flow rate was 30 mL/min and the experiment was performed at room temperature. The following elution profile was used: 0–1 min, isocratic on 0% B; 1–3 min, linear gradient from 0% to 60% B; 3–5 min, isocratic on 60% B; 5–6 min, linear gradient from 60% to 70% B; 6–9 min, isocratic on 70% B; 9–10 min, linear gradient from 70% to 80% B; 10–13 min, isocratic on 80% B; 13–17 min, linear gradient from 80% to 100% B. The eluate was monitored at 
260 nm
. Fractions (10 mL) were analyzed with UHPLC–MS. Fractions containing similar prenylated genistein or prenylated 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives were pooled. The pools were evaporated under vacuum, frozen and freeze-dried. The pools were solubilized in 80% (vol/ vol) aqueous methanol for analysis with UHPLC–MS and solubilized in DMSO to determine their estrogenicity.

4.5. RP-UHPLC– 
MS
analysis

</p>
         <p>
The lupine extracts obtained were analyzed by LC– 
MS
as described previously (

), in duplicate. An Accela 
UHPLC
system (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, 
USA
) was equipped with a pump, autosampler, and photodiode array (PDA) detector. Sample (1 µL) was injected onto an Acquity UPLC BEH shield RP18 column (
2.1 mm
i.d. × 
150 mm
, 1.7 µm particle size; Waters, Milford, MA, 
USA
) with an Acquity UPLC BEH shield RP18 VanGuard precolumn (
2.1 mm
i.d. × 
5 mm
, 1.7 µm particle size; Waters). Water acidified with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid, eluent 
A
, and ACN acidified with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid, eluent 
B
, were used as solvents at a flow rate of 300 µL/min. The temperatures of the autosampler and column oven were controlled at 15 and 35 ° 
C
, respectively. The PDA detector was set to monitor the 
200– 400 nm
range. The elution profile was as follows: 0–2 min, linear gradient from 10% to 25% (v/v) 
B
; 2–9 min, linear gradient from 25% to 50% (v/v) 
B
; 9–12 min, isocratic on 50% 
B
; 12–22 min, linear gradient from 50% to 100% (v/v) 
B
; 22–24 min, isocratic on 100% 
B
; 24–25 min, linear gradient from 100% to 10% (v/v) 
B
; 25–30 min, isocratic on 10% (v/v) 
B
. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a LTQ Velos (Thermo Scientific) equipped with an HESI-MS probe coupled to RP-UHPLC. Nitrogen was used as sheath and auxiliary gas. The spectra were acquired in the 
m
/ 
z
range of 150–1500. Data-dependent 
MS
n

analysis was performed with a normalized collision energy of 35%. The system was tuned with genistein in both positive (PI) and negative ionization (NI) mode. For the PI mode, the ion transfer tube (ITT) temperature was 400 ° 
C
, and the source voltage was 4.50 kV. For NI mode, the ITT temperature was 400 ° 
C
and the source voltage was 3.50 kV. Quantification of (iso)flavonoids was performed based on their absorption at 
260 nm
by means of Xcalibur (version 2.1.0, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, 
USA
). For compounds eluted at the same retention time, the quantification was based on the ratio of intensity of the peaks corresponding to those compounds in full HESI-MS, assuming that no isomers eluted at the same retention time. As for many compounds no commercial standards were available, the amounts of (iso)flavonoid were expressed as mg genistein equivalents per gram dry weight (mg GE/g DW). Genistein was used as a generic standard to make a calibration curve with five data points (0.1– 
0.001 mg
/mL, 
R
2
= 0.998).

4.6. Determination of estrogenic activity
</title>

To determine estrogenic activity of the extracts, a yeast-based bioassay was used (

) with slight modifications as described previously (

), in triplicate. Dilution series of each sample were prepared in 
DMSO
. The final concentration of 
DMSO
in the assay did not exceed 1% (vol/vol). 
A
range of 0.1–10 µg/mL was assayed for the estrogenicity of elicited lupine extracts on ERoi, whereas a range of 0.01–1 µg/mL was prepared for ERβ. Pools containing prenylated 
20
-hydroxygenistein derivatives and prenylated genistein derivatives were tested in the range of 0.0007–0.7 and 0.0005–0.5 µg/mL, respectively, on ERoi, and in the range of 0.00007–0.07 and 0.00005– 0.05 µg/mL, respectively, on ERβ. EC 
50
calculations were performed in Sigma Plot (8.02, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, 
USA
). The yeast-based assay was validated with a dilution series of estradiol. The EC 
50
values of estradiol in the ERoi and ERβ bioassay were 0.74 nM and 0.16 nM, respectively, which were in line with those reported previously (
