Pilocarpus
Vahl
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
), an economically important medicinal plant in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, has a great diversity of imidazole alkaloids and coumarins. In this study, we used phylogenetic comparative methods to determine whether there is a phylogenetic signal for chemical traits across the genus 

<tp:taxon-name>Pilocarpus</tp:taxon-name>
;

this included ancestral reconstructions of continuous and discrete chemical traits. Bioclimatic variables found to be associated with the distribution of this genus were used to perform O 
LS
regressions between chemical traits and bioclimatic variables. Next, these regression models were evaluated to test whether bioclimatic traits could significantly predict compound concentrations. Our study found that in terms of compound concentration, variation is most significantly associated with adaptive environmental convergence rather than phylogenetic relationships. The best predictive model of chemical traits was the OLS regression that modeled the relationship between coumarin and precipitation in the coldest quarter. However, we also found one chemical trait was dependent on phylogenetic history and bioclimatic factors. These findings emphasize that consideration of both environmental and phylogenetic factors is essential to tease out the intricate processes in the evolution of chemical diversity in plants. These methods can benefit fields such as conservation management, ecology, and evolutionary biology.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Plants produce a vast assortment of chemical compounds ranging from primary metabolites, necessary for plant growth and survival, to plant specialized metabolites (PSM) important in growth and plant defense. Many studies have found that closely related species have highly conserved and similar metabolites (

; 

; 

; 

; 

). The similarity of PSM chemical structures in related species is what led to the development of a classification system known as chemotaxonomy or chemosystematics (
C
. De 
S
. 

; 

; 

; 

). However, various studies have shown that closely related species can also have divergent chemical traits; this could be due to disruptive selection in new environments (

; 

; 

), competition in the same environment (

), overdispersion of species in the same community (

) or convergent evolution (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
There are many genetic mechanisms that might increase the diversity of plant specialized metabolites, from the simplest point mutation mechanisms (

) to gene duplication. This duplication can revolutionize PSMs through neofunctionalization producing new PSMs (

), sub-functionalization providing for specialization of a pathway (

), and in the case of allopolyploidy (the combination of two different genomes) providing a diverse array of PSMs. Recent studies depict the role of small RNA's and epigenetics in chemical diversity; however, our understanding remains fragmented (

, 

; 

; 

). Additionally, the promiscuity of enzymes in plants (

) has facilitated the production of a vast array of compounds without the need for highly specific enzymes (

, 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Variation in chemical diversity can be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively, and several studies have found that plants appear to adapt and modify the chemistry expressed in response to both time and space, encompassing many ecological roles (

). The

complexity of alkaloid biosynthetic pathways with stereospecific roles indicates high levels of specialization of alkaloids to their environment (

; 

). In addition, studies on 
<tp:taxon-name>
Heracleum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ruta
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) have shown that variation in temperatures and seasonality can also affect the quantities of coumarins produced in these plants (

, 

; 

). Though many chemical ecology studies have found strong associations between chemical traits and bioclimatic factors, species are non-independent, due to phylogenetic relationships, and therefore it is important to account for the dependence of chemical traits on the shared evolutionary history between species.
</p>
         <p>
Chemotaxonomists have extensively studied patterns of plant specialized metabolites to infer relationships among taxa in 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, a family with 1000's of terpenes, coumarins, and alkaloids (

, 

; 

; 

; 

; Silva et al., 1988). In fact, 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
is the plant family with the richest diversity of alkaloid classes including: acridines, furoquinolines, quinolines, quinazolines, indoloquinazolines, canthinones, benzylisoquinolines, and aromatic amides and amines (

; 

; 

). Of these classes, four are essentially limited to 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
: imidazoles, furoquinolines, acridines, and indoloquinazolines. Major chemical markers studied in 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
have also included coumarins, phenylpropanoids synthesized from the amino acid phenylalanine, due to a great diversity of furanocoumarins and pyranocoumarins (

; 

, 

; 

).

            <tp:taxon-name>
Pilocarpus
Vahl
</tp:taxon-name>
, a genus of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
in the subtribe 
<tp:taxon-name>Pilocarpinae</tp:taxon-name>
(tribe 
<tp:taxon-name>Galipeae</tp:taxon-name>
), is known for its high bioactivity due to the presence of many alkaloids, terpenoids and coumarins (

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilocarpus
</tp:taxon-name>
comprises 16 species and has a widespread distribution from southern 
Mexico
and the Antilles, to northern 
Argentina
(

). Of the members in the subtribe 
<tp:taxon-name>Pilocarpinae</tp:taxon-name>
, three of the four genera have the typical furoquinolines found throughout 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, as well as a few with acridines and indolequinazolines (Silva et al., 1988). Many studies that have looked at the metabolites in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
plant family, have found a progression (from basal species to derived species) of the prominence of certain compounds. Within 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, the prominence of alkaloids in basal lineages differs compared to the more derived lineages where there is a decline of alkaloids correlated with a rise in coumarins (oxygen derivatives), and subsequently a rise in flavonoids, lignans, limonoids, quassinoids and triterpenes (Silva et al., 1988). This could possibly be due to nitrogen economy or the evolution of complex pathways involving many precursors. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilocarpus
</tp:taxon-name>
has many coumarins and terpenes, none of the ubiquitous alkaloids found in the other 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, but instead has developed a unique set of imidazole alkaloids from histidine. Though there have been many studies on these imidazole alkaloids, their biosynthesis is not fully understood (

). It is possible that abiotic/biotic pressures led to the development of this unique set of compounds, necessary after a loss of the ancestral 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
alkaloids in the genus.
</p>
         <p>
In this study, a phylogenetic perspective was used to gain a better understanding of the evolution of imidazole alkaloids and coumarins in species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilocarpus
</tp:taxon-name>
collected in 
Brazil
(
Fig. 1
). We predicted that imidazole alkaloids would have a greater association with phylogenetic relationships than coumarins since imidazole alkaloids are only found in this genus. In addition, based on published work on 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilocarpus

and other species in 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, we predicted that bioclimatic factors have shaped the evolutionary history of chemical traits in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilocarpus
</tp:taxon-name>
. To test these hypotheses we 1) assessed the alkaloid and coumarin variation in the genus, evaluating the effect of phylogenetic relationships on compound presence and quantitative variation; 2) evaluated the relationship of chemical traits with bioclimatic factors to determine whether particular alkaloids and coumarins are associated with specific bioclimatic factors. Comparison of models with and without phylogenetic history helped to assess whether environmental convergence or evolutionary history could best predict chemical patterns in the genus.

at the base of Clade 1 (Clade with

,

as a sister clade of

2.2. Diversity of coumarins and alkaloids across 
<tp:taxon-name>Pilocarpus</tp:taxon-name>
has an inverse relationship

</p>
            <p>
The diversity (total number) of compounds among the species in this clade for both alkaloids and coumarins was reconstructed on the phylogeny using Maximum Likelihood (

total alkaloids, 

total coumarins). The color-coded branches in 

indicate low diversity (yellow) to high diversity (blue) of total compounds. In 

, two major clades are observed: one with a higher diversity of alkaloids (Clade 1 = 

<tp:taxon-name>P. microphyllus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. trachyllophus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. carajaensis</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. jaborandi</tp:taxon-name>
,

and 

<tp:taxon-name>P. racemosus</tp:taxon-name>
)

and the other with a lower diversity of alkaloids (Clade 2 = 

<tp:taxon-name>P. grandiflorus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. riedelianus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. sulcatus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. spicatus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. giganteus</tp:taxon-name>
,

and 

<tp:taxon-name>P. pauciflorus</tp:taxon-name>
).

</p>
            <p>
Interestingly, the coumarin diversity results are reversed on the phylogeny (

). There are still two major clades: one with high coumarin diversity (Clade 2 = 

<tp:taxon-name>P. grandiflorus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. riedelianus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. sulcatus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. spicatus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. giganteus</tp:taxon-name>
,

and 

<tp:taxon-name>P. pauciflorus</tp:taxon-name>
)

and the other with lower coumarin diversity (Clade 1 = 

<tp:taxon-name>P. microphyllus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. trachyllophus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. carajaensis</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>P. jaborandi</tp:taxon-name>
,

and 

<tp:taxon-name>P. racemosus</tp:taxon-name>
).

However, we now see that Clade 1 (the clade with the greatest alkaloid diversity) has the lowest coumarin diversity, and Clade 2 (the clade with the lowest alkaloid diversity) has the greatest coumarin diversity. In addition, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. pennatifolius
</tp:taxon-name>
at the base contains very high numbers of coumarins and the more derived species have the opposite of escalation, a decline in numbers of coumarins, especially for Clade 1.
</p>
            <p>
Phylogenetic signal, a statistical measure assessing phylogenetic dependence, was calculated with Blomberg's K and we found that it was not significant for alkaloid diversity or coumarin diversity (p-value&gt; 0.05). This implies that evolutionary history was not the main contributor for the diversity of compounds, and instead there are other factors affecting the diversity of compounds. One thing to keep in mind is that these two clades are regionally distinct; Clade 1 is mostly found in northern 
Brazil
, the Amazon, and Central America, whereas Clade 2 is mostly found in the southern and eastern regions of 
Brazil
. This distinction is important because as these species dispersed and developed into these different regions they were exposed to a variety of environmental pressures. Evolutionary conservation of naturally occurring compounds comes with a metabolic cost (i.e. carbon), and this cost is a tradeoff that can lead to decreases in other processes such as plant growth (
Nitao and Zangerl, 1987
). Therefore, in new environments directional selection of adaptive evolution could lead to a reduction of compounds that were needed in an old environment, as they have a high cost for no reward, and instead lead to an increase in production of beneficial compounds for the new environment, as they improve fitness and survival (
Olson-Manning et al., 2012
). One interesting example of possible convergence is the similarity of coumarin and alkaloid diversity in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sulcatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 

<tp:taxon-name>P. trachyllophus</tp:taxon-name>
,

two sympatric species growing in the Caatinga of 
Brazil
. It is also important to note that 

<tp:taxon-name>P. pennatifolius</tp:taxon-name>
,

at the base of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilocarpus
</tp:taxon-name>
clade, has a higher diversity for both alkaloids and coumarins.

2.3. Reconstruction of coumarin biosynthetic diversity across 
<tp:taxon-name>Pilocarpus</tp:taxon-name>
            </p>
            <p>
Specialized metabolites can also be considered non-independent traits, since they can be part of the same biosynthetic pathway or network. Although the pathway of imidazole alkaloids is unknown, the relationship between coumarin compounds and pathway enzymes is mostly known or approximated (
Bourgaud et al., 2006
). Therefore, we were able to calculate the Sørensen distance between coumarin compounds for each species, taking into consideration the proportion of shared enzymes to account for shared biosynthetic origins, in order to determine whether there was a large correlation between coumarin compounds (
Sørensen, 1948
; 
Junker et al., 2017
). 

depicts the reconstruction of biosynthetic diversity using the mean of Sørensen distances for each pairwise compound comparison. Clade 2 mostly depicts larger Sørensen distances or few shared enzymes in the pathways for compounds present in Clade 2 species. The majority of species in Clade 1 have small Sørensen distances; therefore, they have more shared enzymes and possibly a greater correlation between compounds present. Overall the majority of species in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilocarpus
</tp:taxon-name>
clade have larger mean Sørensen distance values, representing fewer shared biosynthesis enzymes and a lower correlation of coumarin chemical traits (
Sørensen, 1948
). A larger Sørensen distance is important because the independence of traits is an important consideration for comparative methods. In addition, the mean Sørensen distance values for these species are approximately in the same range as the values found in previous studies for the correlation of chemical traits in plant species (
Sørensen, 1948
; 
Junker et al., 2017
). When we calculated the phylogenetic signal of the mean Sørensen distance we found that it was not significant (λ = 7.58 
−0.05
and p-value&gt; 0.05), thus there is a more random distribution of biosynthetic diversity across the genus.

2.4. Reconstruction of pilocarpine reveals a species with the greatest
concentration
</p>
            <p>
The discrete (stochastic character mapping of presence/absence) and continuous (Maximum Likelihood analysis of quantitative variation) reconstructions of the important medicinal compound pilocarpine (
A
4) are visualized in 

. 

depicts the presence/absence of pilocarpine, establishing its presence in all but two species: 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. spicatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 

<tp:taxon-name>P. giganteus</tp:taxon-name>
.

The pilocarpine trait is lost at the orange “/” on the phylogeny and later regained at the black “/“, this is further confirmed by the marginal probabilities at each node. Next, in our continuous trait reconstructions we determined that 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sulcatus
</tp:taxon-name>
had the greatest concentration of pilocarpine, followed by 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trachyllophus
</tp:taxon-name>
and then 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. grandiflorus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Star symbol indicates 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sulcatus
</tp:taxon-name>
in 

). It is intriguing that the majority of other species in the same clade as 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sulcatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Clade 2) have some of the lowest values for concentrations of pilocarpine, including the absence of pilocarpine itself.
</p>
            <p>
As we see in the figures, pilocarpine concentration is not conserved on the phylogeny and appears to be a divergent trait. In this case, there must be other factors affecting pilocarpine expression. 
A
comparison of the distributions of species in Clade 2 confirmed that the distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sulcatus
</tp:taxon-name>
is distinct. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilocarpus sulcatus
</tp:taxon-name>
is the only species in Clade 2 that has a limited distribution in the Caatinga vegetative areas of southern 
Bahia
and northern 
Minas Gerais
, and it can be found occurring alongside 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trachyllophus
</tp:taxon-name>
from Clade 1 (
Skorupa, 1996
). Although 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sulcatus
</tp:taxon-name>
is one of the smallest shrubs in the genus (height = 
1–2 m
), its growth habit is unique with a low density of branches and simple leaf clusters present at long internodes. In addition, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sulcatus
</tp:taxon-name>
differs from other species in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilocarpus
</tp:taxon-name>
as it has very conspicuous veins, unique perforated pollen, reddish leaf trichomes, and few pellucid dots. This is the first instance that this species has been assessed for imidazole alkaloids, and this study found that 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sulcatus
</tp:taxon-name>
has the largest concentration of pilocarpine compared to the extractions of the 11 other species in this study.

            <p>

2.5. Reconstruction of chemical traits across 
<tp:taxon-name>Pilocarpus</tp:taxon-name>
            </p>
            <p>
In 

, the discrete character reconstructions for three specific compounds are visualized. In 

coumarin (C25) was detected in all of Clade 2 with one subsequent loss on the 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. spicatus
</tp:taxon-name>
branch. This is in contrast to Clade 1, which appears to lose this trait at the base of Clade 1, though it is regained by 

<tp:taxon-name>P. trachyllophus</tp:taxon-name>
.

As C25 is the precursor to a variety of coumarins and furanocoumarins in the genus, it is possible that its disappearance in Clade 1 could be due to its role in forming other specialized coumarins further down the pathway. If there were selection for downstream products, the precursor (C25) would be utilized to 
<tp:taxon-name>form other</tp:taxon-name>
intermediates and compounds along the path, leading to a concentration that is too low to be detected. Since these two major clades are also geographically restricted, it is not possible to determine if these differences are due to random mutation, environmental specialization, or phylogenetic relationships. Next in 

for citropten (C27), there appears to be two losses and two gains in each clade. Finally, in 

the reconstruction of the coumarin osthol (C29) appears to have a somewhat random distribution across the genus, with multiple gains and losses. Although some compounds were not detected in certain species, it is possible that these species could still produce the compounds. This lack of detection could be due to a variety of reasons including low compound concentrations, developmental mechanisms, and environmental plasticity. All of the continuous chemical coumarin traits were reconstructed on the phylogeny and are visualized in Supplemental 

.
</p>
            <p>
Interestingly it appears that C25, C27, and C29 have a similar distribution in Clade 1, being absent in all but one species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trachyllophus
</tp:taxon-name>
. One possibility is that 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trachyllophus
</tp:taxon-name>
needed to adapt to the precipitation and temperature extremes, through the expression of more coumarins for defense (
Zobel and Brown, 1995
). This could be tested with a common garden experiment, verifying if 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trachyllophus
</tp:taxon-name>
continued to produce these compounds in a tropical humid environment. The other species in Clade 1 could also be tested to evaluate whether translocation to a drier environment could lead to expression of C25, C27, and C29. On the other hand, the absence of C25, C27, and C 
29 in
Clade 1 species could be a trade-off. All the other species in Clade 1 can be found in tropical humid regions, facing a greater diversity of pathogens and herbivores. These biological pressures could lead to an increase of other beneficial defense compounds, which could be accompanied by a decrease of the C25, C27, and C29 coumarins.

2.6. Phylogenetic signal of the presence/absence of individual compounds in
the genus
</title>
         <p>
To determine if the presence/absence of individual chemical compounds was a shared phylogenetic trait, we calculated the phylogenetic signal, a measure of statistical dependence of species traits based on shared phylogenetic relationships. Using the D-metric for discrete variables we found that significant phylogenetic signal varied greatly among the compounds. (
Table 1
). Two compounds, 
C
23 and 
C
28 were not analyzed, as they are present in all species of our study. Compounds with significant phylogenetic signal that are more phylogenetically conserved than one would expect under Brownian motion include: 
A
2, 
A
8, 
A
16, 
A
18, 
A
19, and 
A
20. 
A
few compounds, 
A
3, 
A
17, 
C
7, had values for the D-metric that were significantly greater than 1, implying that they are dispersed more randomly than expected across the phylogeny. Calculations of the D-metric for all other compounds were not significantly different for the probability that D = 0 or the probability that D = 1; therefore, no other assumptions can be made for the distribution of these compounds. It is likely that the coumarin compounds would benefit from a larger scale phylogenetic study examining the phytochemical signal in the sub-tribe, tribe, or even sub-family of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
. This expansion is not possible for the imidazole alkaloids as they are restricted to the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilocarpus
</tp:taxon-name>
clade and thus can only be assessed in this manner.

2.7. Phylogenetic signal of quantitative variation in compounds and
bioclimatic variables
</title>
         <p>
Blomberg's 
K
and Pagel's λ were utilized to assess the phylogenetic signal of quantitative variables (
Table 2
). This included the concentration of referenced compounds and the mean values of the five most important bioclimatic variables for species in the genus. There is one compound that has phylogenetic signal for compound concentration. In terms of Blomberg's 
K
, 
C
27 has significant phylogenetic signal (
K
= 1.049, p = 0.049), and considering Pagel's λ (λ = 1.151, p = 0.005) it also has significant phylogenetic signal. When running all the variables under three models (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Brownian motion, and Early Burst) and comparing the AIC values, the Brownian motion model performs best for 
C
25, 
C
27, 
C
28, with the lowest AIC value of 
C
27 as further confirmation of the phylogenetic signal found.
</p>
         <p>
Assessing Blomberg's 
K
for the bioclimatic variables, there is a significant phylogenetic signal for Annual Mean Temperature (AMT) [
K
= 1.232, p = 0.004], Precipitation in the Wettest Quarter (PWQ) [
K
= 1.032, p = 0.013], and Precipitation in the Driest Quarter (PDQ) [
K
= 1.014, p = 0.022] (
Table 2
). When considering Pagel's λ there is a significant phylogenetic signal only for AMT (λ = 0.988, p = 0.042) and PWQ (λ = 0.924, P = 0.049), but no significant signal for PDQ (λ = 0.789, p = 0.265). This variation in PDQ significance could be because Blomberg's 
K
has been found to have greater sensitivity in detecting smaller changes in phylogenetic signal when compared to other metrics such as Pagel's λ, and Abouheif's 
Cmean
(Münkemüller Tamara et al., 2012).

2.8. Association between chemical and climatic traits of species
</title>
         <p>
The relationship between species climatic traits (calculated from a species mean along each bioclimatic variable) and compound traits (concentration or diversity/total number of compounds) was evaluated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions run in the R package nlme. The predictive power of the chemical-bioclimatic trait regressions is compound specific and varies greatly. Overall there are many OLS regressions that have significant R 
2
values ranging from relationships with moderate (R 
2
= 0.55) to higher variability (R 
2
= 0.13) (
Table 3
), with some regressions providing greater precision than others. Considering each bioclimatic trait we see: a) Annual Mean Temperature (AMT) has a significant association with 
C
26 (R 
2
= 0.47, p ≤ 0.001), 
C
25 (R 
2
= 0.36, p ≤ 0.05), 
C
27 (R 
2
= 0.21, p ≤ 0.05), 
C
30 (R 
2
= 0.14, p ≤ 0.05), and coumarin diversity (R 
2
= 0.24, p ≤ 0.05) (
Table 3
); b) Annual precipitation (AP) has a significant association with 
C
26 (R 
2
= 0.20, p ≤ 0.05), 
C
29 (R 
2
= 0.25, p ≤ 0.05), 
C
30 (R 
2
= 0.13, p ≤ 0.10), and coumarin diversity (R 
2
= 0.16, p ≤ 0.10) (
Table 3
); c) Precipitation in the Coldest Quarter (PCQ) has a significant association with 
C
25 (R 
2
= 0.55, p ≤ 0.001), alkaloid diversity (R 
2
= 0.24, p ≤ 0.01), coumarin diversity (R 
2
= 0.37, p ≤ 0.01), 
C
30 (R 
2
= 0.19, p ≤ 0.05), 
C
23 (R 
2
= 0.23, p ≤ 0.05), 
C
29 (R 
2
= 0.17, p ≤ 0.10), and 
C
26 (R 
2
= 0.13, p ≤ 0.10) (
Table 3
); d) Precipitation in the wettest quarter (PWQ) has a significant association with 
C
28 (R 
2
= 0.32, p ≤ 0.01), 
C
24 (R 
2
= 0.29, p ≤ 0.01), 
C
23 (R 
2
= 0.21, p ≤ 0.05), 
C
25 (R 
2
= 0.20, p ≤ 0.05), alkaloid diversity (R 
2
= 0.13, p ≤ 0.10), and coumarin diversity (R 
2
= 0.10, p ≤ 0.10) (
Table 3
); e) Precipitation in the driest quarter (PDQ) did not have any significant R 
2
values, and therefore these regressions cannot predict any of the compound traits (
Table 3
). In addition, we were unable to obtain significant regressions between 
A
4 and the bioclimatic factors assessed in this paper. The most significant predictive regressions were that of the concentration of 
C
25 with Precipitation in the Coldest Quarter, followed by 
C
26 with Annual Mean Temperature, and 
C
25 with Annual Mean Temperature. These three regressions all have negative slopes so we expect higher values of the bioclimatic factor to lead to lower levels of the respective compounds. Studies assessing the impact of temperature on the variation in furanocoumarins (
C
26) and coumarins (
C
25) in species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
have found that these compounds are associated with temperature and water stress (

; 

). In addition, many studies have found that the compounds in the phenylpropanoid pathway (coumarins, flavonoids, and lignins) are very important for the survival and response of a plant to the environment (

).
</p>
         <p>
We next tested for phylogenetic signal in the residual error of the OLS regressions, this included both Pagels λ and Blomberg's 
K
. Pagel's λ estimated significant phylogenetic signal of the residuals for only one regression (
C
27 ∼
PWQ), while Blomberg's 
K
found non-random and significant phylogenetic signal for the residuals of (
C
27 ∼
PWQ), (
C
28 ∼
PWQ), (
C
27 ∼
PWQ), (
C
27 ∼
PCQ), (
C
29 ∼
PCQ), (CD ∼ PCQ), (
C
27 ∼
AP), (
C
25 ∼
AP), and (
C
27 ∼
AMT). This analysis also demonstrated that non-random phylogenetic signal of bioclimatic variables themselves did not signify that phylogenetic signal for the residuals of the chemical-bioclimatic trait regressions would be significant (e.g. PCQ and AP variables had no significant phylogenetic signal but did have chemical trait relationships that were significant, whereas PDQ had significant signal but did not have any significant signal for chemical trait relationships). It is interesting to note that the chemical-bioclimatic trait regressions for all bioclimatic variables (other than PDQ which did not have any significant regressions) with 
C
27 displayed phylogenetic signal in the residuals. For the compounds with phylogenetic signal in the residuals we next analyzed the phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) regression to determine if including phylogeny would provide a better fit. Comparison of OLS and PGLS AIC scores, revealed no significant variation for most regressions; however, PGLS had a better fit for (
C
28 ∼
PWQ) (AIC scores for all regressions OLS and PGLS are provided in Supplementary Table 5). From these analyses, we see that the relationships between phylogenetic relationships and climate vary greatly for each compound. It is important to incorporate both bioclimatic and phylogenetic history into our analyses to better understand the evolution of chemical traits in

3. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
Our results suggest that both phylogenetic relationships and environmental factors have shaped compound variation in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilocarpus
</tp:taxon-name>
. The genus is made up of two regionally distinct clades, Clade 1 (Northern 
Brazil
, Amazon, Central America) and Clade 2 (Southern and Eastern 
Brazil
), with each clade displaying a similar variation in chemistry and an opposite emphasis in compound class expression (Clade 1: high alkaloid diversity with low coumarin diversity, and Clade 2: high coumarin diversity with low alkaloid diversity). In addition, since the biosynthesis of coumarins is well known we were able to assess Sørensen distances, finding that Clade 1 has more shared conserved enzymes than Clade 2. Though most experts agree that related species share similar traits, it is also very possible that related species have divergent chemistry. This difference in chemistry could be driven by many factors including speciation due to expansion into different environments or differentiation into different niche/adaptive spaces in the same location (

; 

). In this study we found that two sympatric species growing in the Caatinga biome of 
Brazil
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. sulcatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trachyllophus
</tp:taxon-name>
, originated from different clades, but their chemical traits were more similar to each other than to their own clades. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilocarpus sulcatus
</tp:taxon-name>
was also revealed to contain the highest concentration of pilocarpine, followed by 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. trachyllophus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. grandiflorus
</tp:taxon-name>
.

         <p>
A
lack of correlation of specialized chemistry with phylogeny could be due to convergent evolution, induction by environmental pressures, variation in development, silent metabolism, or variation at a larger taxonomic scale (

; 

; 

). Further in-field and greenhouse studies would help to assess these possible hypotheses. In the case of the coumarins, additional research can be done to expand the detection of coumarins more broadly within 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
or to the sub-family level within Rutoideae, as this would potentially provide greater power to detect phylogenetic signal in order to identify evolutionary patterns of coumarins. Although we found phylogenetic signal for the presence data of some imidazole alkaloids, expanding the sample of genera to increase significance is not possible in this case as imidazole alkaloids are only present at the small scale of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilocarpus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Of the quantitative traits, there was significant phylogenetic signal for annual mean temperature, precipitation in the wettest quarter, and precipitation in the driest quarter, indicating that related species could share similar niches. In terms of the quantitative chemical traits, only the concentration of 
C
27 had significant non-random phylogenetic signal, and it was the only compound trait in the OLS regressions that had phylogenetic signal in the residual error for almost all regressions with bioclimatic traits. However, we only found one chemical-bioclimatic trait regression was improved with the inclusion of phylogeny: 
C
28 ∼
PWQ. Overall, quantitative variation in coumarin compound traits was most significantly attributed to environmental convergence and independent of phylogenetic relationships.
</p>
         <p>
Compounds such as alkaloids and coumarins have been shown to differ with regard to presence and quantity based on different environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, elevation, precipitation and soil 
type
(

; 

; 

; 

). This compound production in response to the environment, is very important for the survival and evolution of plants (

). The advancement of phylogenetic comparative methods enables the discovery of relationships between the environment and phytochemical diversity. Together these complementary approaches have aided in a better understanding of the coumarins and alkaloids present in the genus 

<tp:taxon-name>Pilocarpus</tp:taxon-name>
,

as well as provided a foundation to inform studies on the biosynthesis of these compounds. Future work identifying the biosynthetic enzymes present in different species would further aid in understanding the evolution of these biosynthetic pathways. 
<tp:taxon-name>Rutaceae</tp:taxon-name>
is a phylogenetically complex family with a rich diversity of chemistry. The combination of phylogenetic comparative methods, environmental factors, and biochemical data is beneficial for studies on the evolution of chemical diversity, ecological studies, and the conservation of bio-diverse areas.

LC-MS analyses were performed with an Acquity UPLC coupled to a TQD triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass-Waters,

All standards were of analytical grade: coumarin standards (scopoletin, psoralen, coumarin, xanthotoxin, citropten, osthol, imperatorin) and the alkaloid standard (pilocarpine) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). There are various statistical approaches to evaluating correlated traits in phylogenetics. Our analysis has included the quantification of phylogenetic signal using three metrics: Pagel's λ to determine the diversity in the genus, the D-metric to determine the signal of individual compounds, and Blomberg's 
K
statistic to assess quantitative variation in compounds (

; 

). Next, ancestral state reconstruction was performed to better characterize evolutionary patterns. Finally, to assess the relationship of metabolites in the genus to extrinsic bioclimatic factors, OLS and PGLS regressions were evaluated.

This method of preservation of leaf tissue for biochemical extractions has been used in many studies that require plant collections in remote areas, as the removal of water reduces enzymatic activity in the leaf tissue and the cold temperature helps to prevent enzymatic reactions due to handling (

Chemical data on alkaloids and coumarins were scored for presence/absence, as well as concentration (Supplemental 
Fig. 2

Table 2

Table 3
). Both alkaloid and coumarin samples were normalized by the exact dry mass of ground tissue extracted. In addition, each species had multiple individual replicates, as well as three biological replicates (Supplemental 
Table 1

Table 4

Table 2

Table 3

Figure 4a

Figure 4a

and (2011). As there are no other standards commercially available for the other imidazole alkaloids we are only presenting quantitative results for one alkaloid, pilocarpine. The standard calibration curve for pilocarpine was run with six calibrators ranging from 0.5 μg/mL – 100 μg/mL (i.e. 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 μg/mL). The Limit of Detection (LOD) and the Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) were calculated as LOD = 3.3σ/slope and LOQ = 10σ/slope. The regression equation for pilocarpine was

Parsimony analyses were run in TNT using the parsimony ratchet, drift, and tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping methods to estimate a consensus tree (
Fig. 2a
). RAxML v. 8.0 was used to estimate a maximum consensus tree using 10,000 bootstrap iterations (
Fig. 2b
) (

). BEAST 2.4.8 analyses were run using the GTR + Γ +I model, implementing an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock as well as a Yule and birth-death process of speciation (

). Two separate runs of 30 million MCMC generations (logged every 100) converged and the effective sample sizes (ESS) were assessed positively in Tracer. The independent runs were combined using LogCombiner with a 20% burn in, and then were used to estimate the maximum clade credibility tree in Tree Annotator (

The BEAST tree was chosen for further phylogenetic comparative analyses since we could calibrate the tree using two

<tp:taxon-name>Ptelea enervosa</tp:taxon-name>

the second 
<tp:taxon-name>

A

Ptelea trifoliata

<tp:taxon-name>

4.8.1. Diversity signal
</title>
         <p>
Phylogenetic signal is the extent that related species resemble each other (

). First the phylogenetic signal for the overall diversity of compounds in each species was determined using Pagel's λ, calculated using the ‘phylosig’ function in the 
phytools
R Package (

; 

). Pagel's λ ranges from 0 to 1, where λ is the transformation of the phylogeny that best predicts the variation in traits across the tree. λ = 0 means that the tree topology does not affect the variation in the trait i.e. no phylogenetic signal. When λ = 1 there is a perfect correlation between the trait and tree topology following a Brownian motion model, i.e. phylogenetic signal. Likelihood ratio tests are employed to test whether λ is significantly greater than 0. To examine the diversity of compounds among the species in this clade, the total number of compounds present in each species was scored, and the chemical diversity trait for both alkaloids and coumarins was reconstructed on the phylogeny using Maximum Likelihood.

The phylogenetic signal of individual compounds was examined by using a discrete binary trait: Compound present = 1, Compound absent = 0. The phylogenetic signal of these discrete binary traits was calculated using the D metric through the R packages 
caper
and 
ape
(

). In the case of the D metric, D = 1 indicates that a trait has evolved randomly across the tree (no signal), whereas D = 0 indicates that a trait has evolved in a way correlated with phylogeny by Brownian motion. In order to measure significance, 1000 permutations are run to obtain a p-value.

4.8.3. Quantitative signal
</title>
         <p>The phylogenetic signal of the quantitative variation of each</p>
         <p>
compound present was calculated using Blomberg's 
K
statistic, utilizing the ‘phylosig’ function in the 
phytools
R package (

; 

). 
K
&gt; 1 indicates that traits have more phylogenetic signal than expected under Brownian motion when 
K
= 1. When 
K
&lt;1 related species are less similar. To test whether 
K
is significant, 1000 randomizations can be run to generate a null distribution and provide a p-value in 
phytools
(

). In addition, Pagel's λ was also calculated to assess the phylogenetic signal of quantitative variation (

). An assessment of evolutionary models was done through examination of AIC values for the following methods: OU = Ornstein-Uhlenbeck; BM = Brownian motion, EB = Early Burst model.

4.9. Bioclimatic variables
</title>
         <p>
Bioclimatic variables (BIO1-BIO19) at 30-arcseconds were extracted from the WorldClim website (www.worldclim.org) using the longitude and latitude coordinates of each collection locality through the R package 
raster
(Etten and 

). The five most significant bioclimatic variables that differentiate niches in the genus were identified in an ecological niche modeling study of the genus (unpublished data Allevato). The mean value for each bioclimatic variable was calculated for each species to be used as a species bioclimatic trait.

4.10.1. Biosynthetic diversity
</title>
         <p>
To assess similarities of coumarin compounds due to the non-independence of pathways and shared enzymes, we first created a master matrix of enzyme presence-absence data to portray the enzymes used in the biosynthesis of each coumarin compound (

) (Supplemental 
Figure 3
). This master matrix was next used to create a new separate enzyme presence-absence matrix for each species that only included the coumarin compounds present for that species. Each species matrix was then used to calculate the Sørensen distance for each pairwise compound comparison. 
A
small Sørensen distance represents a very similar pathway and many shared enzymes; whereas, a large Sørensen distance represents a different pathway with few or no shared enzymes. The mean of the Sørensen distances for each species was identified as the Biosynthetic Diversity of each species (

; 

). We next reconstructed the Biosynthetic Diversity for each node using Maximum Likelihood through the ‘fastAnc’ function in 
phytools
in R (

). And we assessed the phylogenetic signal for the Biosynthetic Diversity of compounds in each species, this was determined using Pagel's λ, calculated using the ‘phylosig’ function in the 
phytools
R Package (

; 

). In this case high phylogenetic signal would indicate a situation where a clade of closely related species would have a similar biosynthetic diversity (i.e. a clade where all have high biosynthetic diversity, or a clade where all have low biosynthetic diversity).

4.10.2. Ancestral trait reconstruction
</title>
         <p>
Character reconstruction was assessed for both continuous and discrete chemical traits. Continuous traits were reconstructed for each node using Maximum Likelihood through the ‘fastAnc’ function in 
phytools
in R (

). Discrete chemical traits were modeled using two methods, the continuous-time Markov chain model (Mk) (

) and Stochastic character mapping (SCM) (

). Mk model was performed using ‘equal rates of changes’ (ER) through the R function ‘rerootingMethod’ of phytools (

; 

). SCM was performed in 
phytools
using the ‘make.- simmap’ function (

), summarizing of a set of 100 stochastic maps.

4.10.3. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and phylogenetic GLS (PGLS)
</title>
         <p>
Regressions of chemical and climatic traits were calculated in R using 
ape, caper,
and 
nlme
packages (

; 

</p>
         <p>
2017). As we observed regional similarities in compound variation, each compound with quantitative data (
A
4, 
C
23eC30, diversity of compounds) was regressed over each bioclimatic variable to evaluate the association between species compound and bioclimatic traits. Previous work from our laboratory identified the five most significant bioclimatic variables that differentiate niches in the genus through an ecological niche modeling study (unpublished data Allevato). In addition, published work from our laboratory has found associations between the metabolomic profile of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. pennatifolius
</tp:taxon-name>
with bioclimatic factors such as temperature seasonality and the mean temperature in wettest quarter (

). Specifically 
C
23, 
C
25, and 
C
30 were associated with higher concentrations when faced with greater temperature seasonality. On the other hand 
C
24, 
C
26, 
C
28, 
C
29 were associated with lower concentrations when faced with greater temperature seasonality (

).
</p>
         <p>
Species bioclimatic traits, or climatic niches, were calculated for each species by using the mean value for each bioclimatic variable. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was evaluated for each chemical and bioclimatic relationship. We next tested whether there was phylogenetic signal in the residual error to determine if it was necessary to run a Phylogenetic Generalized Least squares (PGLS) regression of each OLS relationship (

). In phylogenetic GLS (PGLS), the error term utilizes a variance-covariance matrix that incorporates the branch lengths in the phylogeny to account for shared evolutionary history of the species. We calculated PGLS in R using the 
nlme
and 
caper
packages, with branch lengths scaled using Pagel's λ (

; 

; 

; 

; 

). OLS regressions were evaluated using R 
2
and p 
-
values, and the comparison of OLS and PGLS models for each chemical trait was evaluated using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to establish whether phylogeny improved the model's fit (

). 
A
lower AIC score denotes a more parsimonious model and improved model fit (

; 

; 

).
