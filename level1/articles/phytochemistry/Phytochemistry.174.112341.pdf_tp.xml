1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Liverworts are plentiful sources of terpenoids (

; 

; 

) that exhibit vast structural diversity (

) and intriguing biological activities (

; 

; 

; 

). It is reported that many terpenoids that have been isolated from liverworts are enantiomers of those that are found in other higher plants (

, 

; 

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Odontoschisma
</tp:taxon-name>
is one of the rarely chemically investigated genera in liverworts. Up to now, only 
<tp:taxon-name>
Odontoschisma denudatum
</tp:taxon-name>
has been chemically described, which is a resource for 
ent
-vibsanes, dolabellanes (

; 

), and two previously undescribed skeletal neodenudatenone-type diterpenoids (

). Moreover, the bioactivities of genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Odontoschisma
</tp:taxon-name>
are rarely studied.
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
Candida albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
is one of the normal flora of the healthy human body (

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
can be a pathogen if the normal host defence mechanisms are impaired (

), and virulence factors are the cause of fungal infection by 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
(
Borges et al., 2017
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. Antifungal resistance that is due to the upregulation of efflux pumps is prevalent in clinical 
<tp:taxon-name>
Candida
</tp:taxon-name>
isolates (

; 

). Many terpenoids that have been isolated from liverworts exhibit potent antifungal properties (

). Our previous study identified various liverwort-derived terpenoids (which include eudesmane sesquiterpenoid and labdane lactone), namely, potential efflux pump substrates (PEPSs), that are active against strains that are deficient in efflux pumps but inactive against wild-type strains (

, 

). Some PEPSs produced antifungal activity against wild-type and azole-resistant 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
after glucosylation (

), triphenylphosphonium cation conjugation (

) and co-application with efflux pump inhibitors (

). However, they are typically undetected in routine antifungal screening. Thus, the identification of previously undescribed terpenoids from genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Odontoschisma
</tp:taxon-name>
with PEPS properties substantially expands drug discovery channels for antifungal agents.
</p>
         <p>
Herein, we report in detail the isolation and structural elucidation of eight previously undescribed terpenoids (which include two rare dilospirane-type diterpenoids) (
1–8
), together with two known congeners (
9–10
) (
Fig. 1
) that were isolated from the liverwort 
<tp:taxon-name>
Odontoschisma grosseverrucosum
Stephani (Cephaloziaceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
, which was collected from Wuyanling National Nature Reserve, Lishui City, 
Zhejiang Province
, 
People's Republic of China
, and the evaluation of their antifungal virulence activity.

2.1. Structure elucidation
</title>
         <p>
Odongrossin 
A
(
1
) was obtained as a yellowish oil. The molecular formula of 
1
, namely, 
C
20
H 
34
O 
2
(
m/z
329.2452 [M + Na] 
+
, calcd 329.2451), which has four degrees of unsaturation, was established based on its HRESIMS data. The IR spectrum showed absorptions at 3504 and 
1713 cm
−1
, which were due to one hydroxyl group and one carbonyl group, respectively. The 
1
H NMR data (
Table 1
) showed signals of five methyl groups [
δ
H
0.82 (d, 
J
= 6.8 Hz, H 
3
-19), 0.92 (d, 
J
= 6.8 Hz, H 
3
-18), 1.05 (s, H 
3
-20), 1.08 (s, H 
3
-16) and 2.13 (s, H 
3
-15)] and two highly shielded methines, which were attributed to a tetrasubstituted cyclopropane ring [
δ
H
0.22 (ddd, 
J
= 10.1, 6.9, 5.5 Hz, H-9), and 0.32 (dt, 
J
= 7.1, 5.1 Hz, H-11)]. The 
13
C
NMR (
Table 3
) and the HSQC spectra revealed 20 carbon signals, which were attributed to five methyls, seven methylenes, four methines (including one oxygenated methine; 
δ
C

60.1), and four quaternary carbons (including an oxygenated quaternary carbon and a ketone carbonyl; 
δ
C

85.6 and 209.5, respectively). Due to the presence of one carbonyl group, the four degrees of unsaturation demonstrated that 
1
was a tricyclic structure. The NMR spectroscopic data of 
1
closely resembled that of dilospirane B (

), except for the presence of signals for an oxygenated quaternary carbon at 
δ
C

85.6 and a methyl group [0.92 (d, 
J
= 6.8 Hz, H 
3
-18); 
δ
C

17.5] in 
1
. The presence of a tetrasubstituted ternary ring was supported by HMBC correlations from H 
3
- 20 to C-8, C-9 and C-11, and from H-11 to C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10 and C-20, along with the linkage moiety 
CH
(9)− 
CH
(11) from the 
1
H– 
1
H COSY correlations of H-9 (
δ
H
0.22)/H-11 (
δ
H
0.32). These data provided evidence of one hydroxyl group at C-4, and the double bond between C-17 and C-18 was hydrogenated in 
1
. This was also supported by the HMBC correlations from H 
3
-19 to C-4, C-17 and C-18. Odongrossin 
A
has been regarded as an unnamed skeleton, which we wish to name the dilospirane skeleton since dilospirane B features previously described carbocyclic units (

). This was the first dilospiranetype diterpenoid that was isolated from liverworts. The NOESY correlations (Fig. S6) of H 
3
-16/H-9 and H-9/H 
3
-20 indicated that they were co-facial, and they were assigned as 
α
-oriented. The NOESY correlations of H 
3
-20/H-7 
α
, H-7 
β
/H-5 and H-7 
β
/H-11 indicated that H-5 and H-11 were 
β
-oriented. The NOESY correlation of OH-4/H 
3
-16 recorded in DMSO‑ 
d
6
(Fig. S7) indicated that OH-4 was 
α
-oriented. Accordingly, the relative configuration of 1 was supported. The experimental ECD spectrum perfectly accorded with the trends of the calculated curves for 
1
(Fig. S83 
A
). Thus, the absolute configuration of 
1
was assigned as 1 
S
, 4 
S
, 5 
S
, 8 
R
, 9 
S
, 11

The chemical formula of odongrossin B (
2
), which is a yellowish oil, namely, 
C
18
H 
32
O 
2
(
m/z
281.2477 [M + H] 
+
, (calcd 281.2475) was established based on HRESIMS data, which suggested that it had one fewer degree of unsaturation than 
1
. The IR spectrum showed absorptions at 
3351 cm
−1
, which were due to hydroxyl groups. The NMR spectroscopic data of 
2
(
Tables 1
and 
3
) exhibited similar characteristic signals to those of 
1
, except for the presence of a signal for oxygenated methylene at 
δ
C

63.7 and the disappearance of a ketone carbonyl and a methyl. These data provided evidence that the acetyl group at C- 
13 in
1
was replaced by one hydroxyl group in 
2
. Herein, a degraded dilospirane-type diterpenoid skeleton was suggested. The relative configuration of 
2
was assigned to be the same as that of 
1

Odongrossin

(

3
, namely, 
C

H

3
, as determined by HRESIMS (
m/z
283.1305 [M + Na] 
+
, calcd 283.1305) and 
13
C
NMR data, corresponds to seven degrees of unsaturation. The IR absorption band at 
1764 cm
−1
suggested the presence of a carbonyl functional group. An analysis of the 1D NMR data (
Tables 1
and 
3
) of 
3
and the HSQC spectrum revealed 16 carbon signals that were attributable to four methyls (one methoxyl at 
δ
C

55.5), one methylene, four sp 
3
methines (one oxygenated at 
δ
C

76.5), two sp 
2
methines (
δ
C

107.9 and 130.8), and five quaternary methines (four olefinic carbons at 
δ
C

125.5, 126.4, 138.6 and 157.1, and one carbonyl at 
δ
C

179.1). Herein, a cadinane-type (bicycle [4.4.0] decane) sesquiterpenoid skeleton (

) was suggested. 
A
benzene ring was determined from the HMBC correlations from H 
3
-15 (
δ
H
2.20) to C-2, C-3 and C-4, from H-4 to C-2 and C-6, and from H-1 to C-2, C-3 and C-5. The 
1
H– 
1
H COSY correlations of H-7/H 
2
-8, H 
2
-8/ H-9 and H-9/H-10, along with the key HMBC correlations from H 
3
-14 (
δ
H
1.42) to C-6, C-7 and C-8, led to the identification of a hexatomic ring. The NMR spectroscopic data of 
3
were similar to that of 2- methoxy-calamenene-14-carboxylic acid (

), except for the appearance of an oxygenated methine, as judged by the carbon resonance at 
δ
C

76.5. These data provided evidence of a lactone ring between C-9 and C- 
12 in
3
. This was also supported by the HMBC correlations from H 
3
-13 (
δ
H
1.51) to C-10, C-11 and C-12, and from H-9 to C-11 and C-12. Thus, the planar structure of 
3
was elucidated. NOESY correlations of H-9/H-7 and H 
3
-13/H-10, together with single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis with Mo K 
α
radiation (
Fig. 2C
), were used to assign the relative configuration of 
3
. The absolute configuration of 
3
was determined by comparing the experimental and calculated ECD spectra (Fig. S83B). Thus, the stereochemistry of 
3
was identified as 7 
S

Odongrossin D (

) was obtained as a colourless oil. The HRESIMS spectrum showed the [M + Na] 
+
ion peak at 
m/z
327.2294 (calcd 327.2295) was ascribed to the molecular formula 
C
20
H 
32
O 
2
, which corresponds to five degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum showed absorptions at 3463 and 
1708 cm
−1
, which were due to one hydroxyl group and one carbonyl group, respectively. The 
1
H NMR spectrum (
Table 2
) displayed the signals of four methyls at 
δ
H
1.29 (s, H 
3
-16), 0.90 (d, 
J
= 6.7 Hz, H 
3

H
5.89 (dd, 
J
= 17.4, 10.8 Hz, H-14), 5.09 (dd, 
J
= 10.8, 0.9 Hz, H-15a) and 5.23 (dd, 
J
= 17.4, 0.9 Hz, H-15 b). Additionally, one disubstituted vinyl at 
δ
H
4.56 (br s, H-18a) and 4.43 (br s, H-18 b) was observed. The 
13
C
NMR (
Table 3
) and HSQC spectra supported the presence of two terminal double bond (
δ
C

158.2, 103.2; 144.9, 112.4), a carbonyl ketone at C-7 (
δ
C

214.2), and an oxygenated quaternary carbon (
δ
C

73.3). 
A
clerodane-type diterpenoid skeleton (

) was suggested. The data of 
4
corresponded to a similar structure to that of chelodane (

), except for the appearance of a carbonyl ketone, as judged by the carbon resonance at 
δ
C

214.2. The HMBC correlations from H 
2
-6 to C-7 and from H-8 to C-7 indicated that the carbonyl was located at C-7. The NOESY correlations (Fig. S38) of H 
3
-17/H 
3
-20 and H 
3
-20/H 
3
-19 indicated that they were co-facial and 
α
-oriented. The NOESY correlation of H-10/H-8 indicated the 
β
-orientation of the two protons. Accordingly, the relative configuration of 
4
was determined. The absolute configuration was further supported by ECD calculations, as presented in Fig. S83 
C
. Thus, 
4
was identified as 5 
R

5
(
Tables 2

3
) exhibited similar characteristic signals to those of 
4
, except that the ketone carbonyl group at C- 
7 in
4
was replaced by a hydroxyl group in 
5
, which was further supported by the HMBC correlations (Fig. S46) from H 
3
-17 (

shifted to C-6 (

O 
2
based on its HRESIMS data (
m/ z
320.2581 [M + NH

, calcd 320.2584), which correspond to six degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum showed an absorption peak at 
1711 cm
−1
, which was due to the carbonyl group. The 
1
H and 
13
C
NMR data (
Tables 2

3
) revealed four methyls (including two secondary methyls and one vinyl methyl), six methylenes, a three-substituted trans-olefine, a two-substituted trans-olefine [
δ

δ
C

116.1 and 141.3], and two carbonyl groups (
δ
C

215.1 and 204.8). The gross structure of 
7
was constructed via a detailed analysis of its 2D NMR data (Figs. S66 and S67). These data of 
7
revealed a similar structure to that of denudatenone B (

), except that the location of the double bond was transferred from Δ 
7
to Δ 
8(17)
in 
7

H–

2

J

). The 
13
C
NMR data (
Table 3
) showed one ester carbonyl at 
δ
C

176.9 (C-18). The 1D NMR spectroscopic data of 
8
closely resembled those of the previously described notolutesin 
A
(
9
) (

), except that an 
E
-double bond at C-3 was reduced in 
8
. This was also supported by the HMBC correlation from H 
2
-1 and H 
2
-3 to C-2 and by the 
1
H– 
1
H COSY correlation between H-2 and H 
2
-3. The NOESY correlation (Fig. S78) of H-2/H 
3

2.2. Results on the anti-virulence activity of the compounds
</title>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
Candida albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
has developed numerous virulence factors for causing disease in a host, such as hyphal formation, adhesion, and biofilm formation. The targeting of virulence factors has been proposed as a potential therapy for candidiasis (

). Thus, we evaluated the effects of compounds 
1–10
on the morphological transitions of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
DSY
</tp:taxon-name>
654 and wild-type strain 
SC
5314 (

). The results demonstrated that compounds 
1
and 
7
exhibited antifungal activity by inhibiting the hyphal formation of 
DSY
654 (
Table S1
). Between them, 
1
displayed the more potent inhibitory effect, which could restrict 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
in yeast form at the concentration of 16 
μ
g/mL within 6 h (
Fig. 3A
). Therefore, we investigate the inhibitory performance of 
1
against adhesion and biofilm formation. The results demonstrated that 
1
exhibited potent, dose-dependent inhibitory activity against the adhesion and biofilm formation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. 3B, C, 3D, and 3E
). Above all, 
1
has the potential to inhibit adhesion, hyphal formation and biofilm formation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
To identify the underlying mechanisms of the inhibited morphological transition, we investigated the transcription levels of genes that are related to the hyphal formation and cell adhesion in 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
using real-time RT-PCR. According to 
Fig. 3F
, the expressions of adhesion-related genes (
HWP1
, 
ECE1
and 
ALS3
) were downregulated by 
1
at 6 h. Furthermore, the hyphae-formation-regulated genes in the Ras1-cAMP-PKA signalling pathway were downregulated to varying extents, as 
CDC35
was downregulated in the presence of 
1
, which can result in a decrease of the intracellular cAMP content. In addition, the genes that are associated with the MAPKA pathway (
CST20
and 
HST7
) and transcription factors (
TEC1, UME6,
and 
BCR1
) were downregulated to varying extents. These results suggest that 
1
likely regulates the expression of genes that are related to the virulence of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
to retard the yeast-to-hyphae transition.

3. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
In summary, eight previously undescribed terpenoids (
1–8
), which include a dilospirane skeleton in compounds 
1–2
, a cadinane skeleton in compound 
3
, a clerodane skeleton in compounds 
4–6
, a vibsane skeleton in compound 
7
and a dolabrane skeleton in compound 
8
, together with two known terpenoids (
9–10
) were isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. grosseverrucosum
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
A
plausible biogenetic pathway of compounds 
1–3
and 
7
was proposed (
Fig. 4
). The characteristic skeleton of compound 
1
was derived from dolastane diterpenoid (

) via selective oxidation, 
C
9
– 
C
14
cleavage and cyclopropanation, and compound 
2
was transformed from 
1
under Baeyer-Villiger 
type
oxidation condition. The aromatic rings and lactone of compound 
3
possessed cadinane sesquiterpenoid framework (

) could be constructed by aromatization and C- 
12
oxidation, respectively. Compound 
7
was formed similarly through late-stage oxidation and functionalization of vibsane diterpenoid. Two compounds could inhibit the yeast-filamentous growth transition of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
DSY
</tp:taxon-name>
654 to various degrees but were inactive against 
SC
5314. Additional studies of 
1
suggested that it could significantly attenuate the virulence of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
by inhibiting hyphal formation, adhesion, and biofilm formation and by regulating the expression of virulence-related genes. Thus, searching for PEPSs from liverworts may be an efficient strategy for discovering previously undescribed compounds for fighting clinically relevant fungal infections.
