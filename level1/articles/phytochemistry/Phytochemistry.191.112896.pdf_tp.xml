         <p>
Feline calicivirus is one of the surrogate viruses of human norovirus. This study aimed to identify virucidal compounds, chemical constituents of plants from the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dracocephalum
</tp:taxon-name>
, which are rich in flavonoids and phenylpropanoid oligomers. Four undescribed compounds, including a flavanone glucoside, two stilbenoid glycosides, and a phenylpropanoid amide glycoside, as well as 17 known compounds, were isolated from the Mongolian plants 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dracocephalum fruticulosum
Stephan ex Willd.
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. nutans
</tp:taxon-name>
L. belonging to the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Lamiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
. The structures of the compounds were determined based on NMR, MS, and electronic CD spectroscopic data. In addition to these 21 compounds, 15 previously reported compounds from 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. foetidum
Bunge
</tp:taxon-name>
in C.F. von Ledebour were included, and a total of 36 compounds were evaluated for their virucidal activities against feline calicivirus. Some of the flavanone glycosides and phenylpropanoid oligomers showed virucidal activities, and their structural features are discussed. The findings suggest that isosakuranetin glycosides and phenylpropanoid oligomers may have the potential for norovirus inactivation.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Seventeen species of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dracocephalum
(Lamiaceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
are distributed in 
Mongolia
, and many of them are known as medicinal plants (

; Ozek ¨et al., 2013; 

, 

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. fruticulosum
Steph. ex Willd.
</tp:taxon-name>
is called “Jivzipriyangu,” and its medicinal preparations are used in traditional Mongolian medicine for the treatment of liver disease, wounds, and blood clots (

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
D
. 
nutans
</tp:taxon-name>
L. is called “priyangku” in Tibetan medicine, and its medicinal preparations are used internally for abdominal and kidney inflammation (

). Essential oils are one of the features of various 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dracocephalum
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
plants, and 
cis
-chrysanthenol acetate and 
trans
-verbenol from 
<tp:taxon-name>
D
. 
fruticulosum
</tp:taxon-name>
(Ozek ¨et al., 2013), as well as pinocamphone and β- pinene from 
<tp:taxon-name>
D
. 
nutans
</tp:taxon-name>
, were reported as chemical constituents of volatile oils (

; 

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
D
. 
foetidum
Bunge
</tp:taxon-name>
in C.F.von Ledebour is a medicinal plant used for the treatment of inflammation, and monoterpene glycosides, phenylpropanoid oligomers, and flavonoids were identified in this plant in a previous study (

).
</p>
         <p>
Every year, approximately 600 million cases of foodborne diseases and 420,000 deaths occur worldwide (World Health Organization, 2021). Norovirus, which causes acute gastroenteritis, is the leading cause of nonbacterial foodborne diseases (

; 

). Norovirus is a nonenveloped RNA virus belonging to the family 
<tp:taxon-name>
Caliciviridae
</tp:taxon-name>
that was first identified in 1972 from an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis that occurred in 
1968 in
Norwalk, OH, 
USA
(

). Norovirus causes watery diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, mild fever, and severe illness and can be transmitted through person-to-person contact (

). Although people of all ages are infected with norovirus, children younger than 5 years old and persons over 65 years old are at the highest risk of norovirus infection, which is associated with hospitalizations and death (

). In addition, norovirus can cause long-term chronic gastroenteritis in immunocompromised patients (

). Norovirus also causes significant economic losses in the healthcare and food industries (

). Therefore, to minimize the burden to health and wealth, norovirus infection should be controlled. Although a method for human norovirus replication using stem cell-derived human intestinal enteroids, obtained from intestinal tissue biopsies, was reported in 2016 (

), easier methods using established cell lines have not yet been developed. Because of these limitations in basic research, no specific drugs and vaccines against norovirus have been developed. Thus, one of the best ways to control norovirus infection and minimize losses is the disinfection of viruses remaining in the environment.
</p>
         <p>
However, alcohol-based disinfectants are not an efficient option for the inactivation of nonenveloped 
<tp:taxon-name>
Caliciviridae
</tp:taxon-name>
viruses (

). Since the tolerability to alcohol seems to be different among different norovirus strains (

), the use of high concentrations of chlorine bleach (sodium hypochlorite) is recommended for the disinfection of norovirus. However, chlorine has corrosive activity and irritates the skin, mucous membrane, and upper airways (

).
</p>
         <p>
Hence, to find effective norovirus-inactivating materials with no adverse effects on human health, we focused on plant-derived components. We have previously reported (

) that components derived from the Mongolian herbal plant 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saxifraga spinulosa
</tp:taxon-name>
, including flavonoids and galloyl glycosides (

), showed virucidal activities against feline calicivirus (FCV), which is known as one of the surrogates of human norovirus, murine norovirus, influenza A virus, and SARS-CoV-2.
</p>
         <p>
In this study, we focused on Mongolian plants of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dracocephalum
</tp:taxon-name>
as potential sources of candidate antiviral compounds.

J

J
= 17.0, 3.0 Hz, H-3eq) suggested the presence of a flavanone skeleton. The pseudo-axial or equatorial orientation of H 
2
-3 were determined by the large coupling constant (
J

). The methoxy proton 
δH
3.81 (3H, s) and carbon 
δC
55.8 resonances were observed, and the methyl proton was long-range coupled with the C-4 
′
(
δC
161.6), which showed that the aglycone moiety was isosakuranetin. In 
13
C NMR spectra, six glucosidic carbons (
δC
101.2, 74.7, 77.9, 71.6, 75.6, 65.4, C-Glc-1–6) and two carbonyl carbons (
δC

δC
65.4, C-Glc-6) resonances were lower field shifted than those of isosakuranetin 7- 
O

corresponded to a malonyl moiety compared with isosakuranetin 7-

). In a heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) spectrum (

δC
168.8. These 
1
H and 
13
C NMR chemical shifts of Glc-6 and HMBC correlation showed a malonyl group bond to C-Glc-6. In an electronic CD (ECD) spectrum (
Fig. 3
), the negative Cotton effect at 
286 nm
showed the (2 
S
)-absolute configuration of 
1
(

; 

). HPLC sugar analysis after acid hydrolysis indicated that the sugar moiety was D-glucopyranose. The coupling constant of the anomeric proton (
J

1
was determined to be (2 
S
)-isosakuranetin 7-

(DMSO‑

Table 1
), two sets of aromatic proton resonances (
δH
6.99, 2H, brd, 
J
= 8.5 Hz, H-3 and H-5 and 7.09, 2H, brd, 
J

δH

J
= 8.0, 7.5 Hz, H-11, and 6.72, 1H, d, 
J
= 8.0 Hz, H-12) were observed, and the former and latter coupling system protons suggested the presence of a 
p
-substituted benzene ring and trisubstituted benzene ring moieties, respectively. The aromatic carbons [
δC
135.1 (C-1), 128.8 (C-2 and C-6), 116.4 (C-3 and C-5), 155.6 (C-4), 141.0 (C-9), 120.1 (C-10), 130.6 (C-11), 113.9 (C-12), 156.8 (C-13), and 119.9 (C-14)] were assigned to the two benzene rings by heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) and HMBC correlations (
Fig. 4
). In the aliphatic field of the 
1
H NMR spectrum, two methylene protons at 
δH
2.75 (2H, m, H-7) and 2.88 (2H, m, H-8) were observed and their coupling with each other was confirmed by the 
1
H– 
1
H COSY spectrum of 
19
. This result suggested the presence of an – 
CH
2
- 
CH
2
- moiety. In the HMBC spectrum of 
19
, H-7 was long-range coupled with C-2 and C-6, and H-8 was coupled with C-10 and C-14, showing a dihydrostylbene skeleton. The carbonyl carbon at 
δC
170.5 (C-15) had no HMBC correlation, and it was hypothesized that the carbonyl group was bonded to C-14 compared to lunularic acid (

). The HMBC correlations from H-11 to C-9 and the oxygenated carbon (C-13) and H-10 and H-12 to C-14 supported this conclusion. These data showed that 
19
had a 4- 
O
-13-hydroxy-14-carboxydihydrostylbene moiety as its aglycone (
Fig. 4
). In the 
13
C NMR spectrum of 
19
, 12 oxygenated carbon resonances were observed at 
δC
99.3, 82.8, 76.1, 69.4, 76.9, 60.6 (C-Glc-1 – 6) and 
δC
104.6, 74.8, 75.9, 69.6, 76.8, 60.6 (C-Glc-II-1 – 6), and these data showed the presence of two glycosyl moieties (

; 

). HPLC sugar analysis of 
19
after acid hydrolysis suggested that the sugar units were D-glucopyranose. The coupling constants of the anomeric protons of H-Glc-1 (
J
= 7.0 Hz) and H-Glc-II-1 (
J
= 8.0 Hz) showed β- configurations. In the HMBC spectrum, the H-Glc-II-1 proton resonance at 
δH
4.48 (1H, d, 
J
= 8.0 Hz) was long-range coupled with C-Glc-2, and H-Glc-1 at 
δH
4.91 (1H, d, 
J
= 7.0 Hz) was coupled with C-4. Therefore, 
19
was determined to be 2-hydroxy-6-{2-[4- 
O
-β- D-glucopyranosyl(1 → 2)- 
O
-β- D-glucopyranosylphenyl] ethyl}benzoic acid, as shown in 
Fig. 1

o

J

J
= 8.0, 2.0 Hz H-6) showed the presence of an 
m
, 
p
- dioxygenated benzene ring moiety. The hydroxy proton resonance at 
δH
7.85 was observed in the 
1
H NMR spectrum of 
20
(DMSO‑ 
d
6
, 
Table 1
), suggesting the presence of an additional hydroxy group compared to 
19
. The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra were similar to those of 
19
, except for the presence of an 
m
, 
p
-dioxygenated benzene ring instead of the 
p
-oxygenated benzene ring of 
19
. These MS and NMR data suggested that the aglycone of 
20
was a 4- 
O
-3,13-dihydroxy-14-carboxydihydrostylbenoid moiety (
Fig. 4
). In the HMBC spectrum (
Fig. 4
), H-Glc-II-1 (
δH
4.74, 1H, d, 
J
= 7.5 Hz) was long-range coupled with C-Glc-2 (
δC
83.5), and H-Glc-1 (
δH
4.72, 1H, d, 
J
= 7.5 Hz) was coupled with C-4 (
δC
145.2). These correlations showed the presence of a 4- 
O
-β- D-glucopyranosyl(1 → 2)- 
O
- β- D-glucopyranosyl moiety. The nuclear Overhauser effect correlation between H-Glc-1 and H-5 (
δH
7.16, 1H, d, 
J
= 8.0 Hz) supported the bonding of the glucosyl moiety to C-4 (
Fig. 4
). Therefore, 
20
was determined to be 2-{2-[3-hydroxy-4- 
O
-β- D-glucopyranosyl(1 → 2)- 
O
- β- D-glucopyranosyl-phenyl]ethyl}-6-hydroxybenzoic acid, as shown in

H NMR spectrum of

J

and 6.56, 1H, d,

) were observed. The carbonyl carbon at 
δC
168.7 (C-9 
′
) and the HMBC correlation from H-8 
′
to C-1 
′
(
δC
136.4) showed the presence of a cinnamoyl moiety (
Fig. 4
). The coupling constant between H-7 
′
and H-8 
′
(
J
= 16.0 Hz) showed their 
E
-configuration. In the aliphatic field of 
1
H NMR, proton resonances of – 
CH

CH
2
- moiety (
δH
2.82, 2H, brt, 
J
= 7.0 Hz, H-7 and 3.52, 2H, overlapping, H-8) were observed, and H-7 was long-range coupled with C-1, C-2, and C-6. These data suggested the presence of a 
p
-substituted phenylethyl moiety. The presence of one nitrogen was indicated by HRFABMS. The chemical shift value of C-8 (
δC
42.4) suggested that C-8 bonded to a nitrogen. The H-8 proton was long-range coupled with the C-9 
′
carbonyl carbon of amide. These data showed that the aglycone of 
21
was (2 
E
)- 
N
-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]-3-phenyl-2-propenamide. The three anomeric proton resonances (
δH
5.73, 1H, d, 
J
= 1.5 Hz, H-Rha-1; 4.61, 1H, d, 
J
= 7.5 Hz, H-Glc-I-1; 4.43, 1H, d, 
J
= 8.0 Hz, H-Glc-II-1) were observed in the 
1
H NMR spectrum of 
21
. The homonuclear Hartmann–Hahn (HOHAHA) spectra showed spin system protons from each anomeric proton, as discussed below. Their corresponding carbons were assigned by HMQC spectrum of 
21
. These suggested the presence of one rhamnosyl and two glucosyl moieties (

; 

). The peaks of L-rhamnopyranose and D-glucopyranose derivatives were confirmed by HPLC sugar analysis after acid hydrolysis. The α- and β- orientations of L-rhamnopyranosyl and D-glucopyranosyls were determined by their coupling constants 
J
= 1.5 Hz and 7.5–8.0 Hz, respectively. The HMBC correlations from H-Rhm-2 (
δH
4.35, 1H, dd, 
J
= 3.0, 1.5 Hz) to C-Glc-I-1 (
δC
105.9), H-Glc-I-1 to C-Rha-2 (
δC
79.9), H-Rhm-3 (
δH
4.16, 1H, dd, 
J
= 10.0, 3.0 Hz) to C-Glc-II-1 (
δC
106.6), and H-Glc-II-1 to C-Rha-3 (
δC
79.6) showed that the sugar chain was 
O
-β- D-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-[
O
-β- D-glucopyranoside-(1 → 3)]- 
O
-α- L-rhamnopyranosyl. In addition, there were two acetyl groups in 
21
(
δH
2.00, 3H, s; 2.09, 3H, s; 
δC
172.7; 21.1). The lower field shifted oxymethylene resonances (
δH
4.36, 1H, dd, 
J
= 12.0, 2.0 Hz and 4.31, 1H, dd, 
J
= 12.0, 6.5 Hz) were assigned to H-Glc-II-6 protons by the below procedure. In the HOHAHA spectra, when H-Glc-II-1 (
δH
4.43) was irradiated, the correlation with H-Glc-II-5 (
δH
3.51) was shown. Moreover, the H-Glc-II-5 proton correlated with the H-Glc-II-6 protons in the 
1
H– 
1
H COSY spectrum. In the HMBC spectrum, H-Rha-4 (
δH
5.11, 1H, t, 
J
= 10.0 Hz) and H-Glc-II-6 (
δH
4.31, 1H, dd, 
J
= 12.0, 6.5 Hz) were long-range coupled with the carbonyl carbons of the acetyl groups. The lower shifted carbon resonances (
δC
73.7, C-Rha-4; 64.9, C-Glc-II-6) supported this conclusion. Based on these data, 
21
was determined to be (2

Some early research showed that naturally occurring dietary flavonoids possessed antiviral activities against several human viruses (

). In addition, many studies have shown multiple antiviral mechanisms of flavonoids, such as virucidal action against extracellular virions, blocking of virus entry into a cell, and inhibition of viral enzymatic activities essential for viral replication (

; 

). In our study, a total of 21 flavonoids derived from

were tested for FCV-inactivating activity, and only 5 of them (
1–3

5
, and 
7
) showed antiviral activities. In particular, 
1
and 
2
may have more potent virucidal activities than those of other flavonoids because these two compounds showed virucidal activity after 6 h of incubation. Thus, flavanones (
1–3
and 
5

6–14
and 
27–33
), and flavanone glucosides (
1–3
and 
5
) showed higher activities than that of naringenin (
4
). Although 0.5 mM naringenin (
4
) did not show any virucidal activities against FCV and murine norovirus after 2 h of incubation (

), antiviral activities of naringenin (
4
) were reported against dengue virus (FrabasileKoishi et al., 2017; Zandi et al.,), zika virus (

), and hepatitis C virus (

). As the isolated 4 
′
- 
O
-methyl naringenin (isosakuranetin) glycosides (
1
and 
2
) showed higher activities than that of naringenin (
4
), they may have the potential to be used as virucidal compounds.
</p>
         <p>
In addition, we found five rosmarinic acid-related virucidal compounds, namely, 
15–17
, 
22
, and 
25
. Rosmarinic acid (
15
) is known to have antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant activities (

; 

). Compounds 
16
, 
17
, and 
22
are typical rosmarinic acid derivatives. Interestingly, 
25
is a rosmarinic acid glucoside. As the acylated rosmarinic acid glucosides (
23
and 
24
) and the 
Z
-rosmarinic acid glucoside (
26
) did not show activity, the effect of the glucosyl moiety remains uncertain. Phenylpropanoid oligomers have been isolated from various plants of the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Lamiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(

, 

). In addition to the virucidal activity of rosmarinic acid, antiviral activities have been reported for caffeic acid derivatives. For example, some caffeic acid oligomers from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Mesona chinensis
</tp:taxon-name>
showed antiviral activities against the respiratory syncytial virus (

). Rosmarinic acid and its derivatives are known to have tannin-like activity (

), and the results of this study revealed potentially broader antiviral activity spectra of phenylpropanoid oligomers.

3. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
An undescribed isosakuranetin glucoside was isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. fruticulosum
</tp:taxon-name>
. Furthermore, undescribed compounds, including two stilbene glycosides and a phenylpropanoid amide glycoside, were obtained from 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. nutans
</tp:taxon-name>
. Virucidal activities against FCV, a surrogate viruses of human norovirus, were evaluated for a total of 36 compounds, including flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides, phenylpropanoids, phenylpropanoid glycosides, a benzyl glucoside, and monoterpene glycosides, from three 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dracocephalum
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
plants. Among these compounds, isosakuranetin and naringenin glycosides and phenylpropanoid oligomers, including rosmarinic acid, schizotenuin A, and lycopic acid A, showed virucidal activities. These results suggested the potential for the flavanone glycosides and phenylpropanoid oligomers to be used for norovirus inactivation.

4.5. Evaluation of FCV-inactivating activity
</title>
         <p>
Crandell–Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cells and FCV (F9 strain) were provided by Dr. K. Maeda (
Yamaguchi
University, 
Yamaguchi
, 
Japan
). CRFK cells were not tested for mycoplasma infection. They were cultured in the viral growth medium after FCV inoculation, as previously described (

). After 3 days of incubation, the supernatant of the cell culture medium containing FCV was collected and used for the FCV suspension. The viral titers of the FCV suspensions were 3.25–5.75 log 
10
TCID 
50
/ml. The 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dracocephalum
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
-derived compounds at a concentration of 25 μg/ml or DMSO, used as the solvent control, were added to the FCV suspensions. All FCV suspensions were incubated at 25 
◦
C for 6 and 48 h. After incubation, these suspensions were inoculated into CRFK cells, and 10-fold serial dilutions were performed in the cell culture medium. Three days later, their cytopathic effects on FCV-infected cells were observed, and the viral titers (log 
10
TCID 
50
/ml) were calculated using the Behrens–Karber ¨method (Karber ¨, 1931). The differences in the titers of FCV suspensions in each test group vs. the DMSO group were evaluated as previously described (

).

4.6. Statistical analysis
</title>
         <p>
The student’ s 
t
-test was performed to analyze the statistical significance of the difference in viral titer between each test compound group and the DMSO group. 
P
values 
&lt;
0.05 were considered statistically significant.
