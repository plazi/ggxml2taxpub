Dengue virus (DENV) is an arbovirus widespread through tropical and subtropical areas. It is transmitted to humans through 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aedes
</tp:taxon-name>
mosquitoes. Infections with DENV can lead to a series of complications, including dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever, or dengue shock syndrome, which might manifest through secondary infections because of a vulnerable immune system. To date, only one tetravalent DENV vaccine is approved to be administered to children whom have been previously DENV-infected and between 9 and 16 years of age. One of the key targets in discovering DENV antiviral agents is the NS2b/NS3 protease. This protease is a crucial enzyme complex for the proteolytic and cleavage activities of the translated polyprotein during DENV life cycle. Several studies were conducted to discover potential antivirals from natural sources or synthetic compounds and peptides. In this review, we describe the recent studies from the past five years dealing with isolated natural products as potential inhibitors of DENV with a greater focus on inhibiting the NS2b/NS3 protease. This review describes recent discoveries in anti-DENV potential of isolated phytochemicals belonging to different groups including fatty acids, glucosides, terpenes and terpenoids, flavonoids, phenolics, chalcones, acetamides, and peptides. Curcumin, quercetin, and myricetin were found to act as non-competitive inhibitors for the NS2b/NS3 protease enzyme. In some studies, the molecular targets of some of these compounds are yet to be identified using 
in-silico
and 
in-vitro
approaches. So far, none of the isolated natural products was tested clinically for the management of DENV infections. The discussed studies demonstrate that natural products are a rich source of potential antiDENV compounds. However, not all of these compounds were studied for their kinetic molecular mechanism and type of inhibition. 
In-silico
studies provided an ample number of phytochemical hits to be tested experimentally as DENV protease inhibitors. In conclusion, derivatives of these natural products can be designed and synthesised, which could enhance their specificity and efficacy towards the protease. Other sources of natural products, such as fungi, bacterial toxins, marine organisms, and animals, should also be explored towards discovering more potential and effective DENV NS2b/NS3 protease inhibitors.

Dengue is a mosquito-borne tropical and sub-tropical communicable viral disease caused by dengue virus (DENV) (Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010). DENV is a member of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Flavivirus
</tp:taxon-name>
genus that belongs to 
<tp:taxon-name>Flaviviridae</tp:taxon-name>
family and consists of a single enveloped positive RNA strand (Malavige et al., 2004; Simmonds et al., 2017). DENV has five distinct serotypes (DENV1-5) (Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2016; Taylor-Robinson, 2016), with DENV2 being the most prevalent among the other serotypes (Y. K. Lee et al., 2007). DENV is considered as a prototype to recognise and study the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Flavivirus
</tp:taxon-name>
genus structure and replication cycle (Lescar et al., 2018). DENV is an arbovirus, an acronym for ARthropod-BOrne VIRUS. This type of virus has a very complex life cycle because it requires more than one host to complete it. This unique characteristic is a major challenge in monitoring the spread of arboviruses. Therefore, it is important to study their life cycle, prophylaxis, and treatment (Sukhralia et al., 2018). Three species of the mosquitos’ genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aedes
</tp:taxon-name>
are the main transmitting vectors of DENV; 

<tp:taxon-name>Aedes aegypti</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aedes polynesiensis</tp:taxon-name>

, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aedes albopictus
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. aegypti
</tp:taxon-name>
is considered the main DENV-infection causative agent (Malavige et al., 2004).

One approach to control DENV endemics is vector control which represents a principal method in controlling vector-borne diseases (Wilson et al., 2020). Vector control methods of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aedes
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
mosquitoes can be distinguished into three approaches which include environmental, biological, and chemical (Buhler et al., 2019). The environmental approach to control the spread of DENV is through waste management, the use of water-containers’ covers, and elimination of breeding spots (Buhler et al., 2019). On the other hand, biological measures include the use of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, which produces certain toxins that can kill insects larvae and fungi in water containers while expressing no effects on other organisms. Other reported biological measures include the use of copepods (
<tp:taxon-name>
Mesocyclops
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
) and larvivorous fish (
<tp:taxon-name>
Poecilia reticulata
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Gambusia affinis
</tp:taxon-name>
), where they feed on the larvae of the mosquito before they turn into adults (Walton, 2007; Horstick et al., 2017). In contrast, chemical methods are the most used measures for vector control (Alkuriji et al., 2020). They include sprayable insecticides and fumigation through the application of synthetic pyrethroids, deltamethrin, 
S
-bioallethrin, piperonyl butoxide, pyriproxyfen, and permethrin. Temephos (an organophosphate larvicide) and malathion (an organophosphate insecticide) are other chemical agents which have been used to treat water and control the larval habits of the mosquito (Horstick et al., 2017). A greener approach for controlling DENV vector is the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Wolbachia
</tp:taxon-name>
-based strategy (Sim et al., 2020). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Wolbachia
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
is a genus of a Gram-negative bacteria that is naturally present in some invertebrates and can prevent RNA viruses from replication. Hence, no offspring can develop if an infected male 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aedes
</tp:taxon-name>
mosquito fertilises an uninfected female. On the contrary, if an uninfected male fertilises an infected female, the offspring will be bearing 

<tp:taxon-name>Wolbachia</tp:taxon-name>
,

and the number of laid eggs will be less. This way, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Wolbachia
</tp:taxon-name>
strategy can offer a safer and more economical approach to controlling the spread of mosquito-borne diseases (Alkuriji et al., 2020). Similarly, green pesticides from the plant kingdom were seen to prove their efficacy against 
<tp:taxon-name>

and their larvae. These include extracts of

         <p>Infection with DENV can result in a variant of complications and symptoms. These complications mainly vary between asymptomatic dengue fever (DF), mild DF, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) (Khetarpal and Khanna, 2016). The severity of these complications generally varies according to the infecting serotype. It has been reported that DENV2 infections are more severe than the other serotypes and are typically associated with DHF and DSS (Vicente et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020). In contrast, DENV4 is reported to be generally the most clinically mild (Aryati et al., 2020). However, secondary infections might manifest during a DENV infection due to a vulnerable immune system or an accessible route of entry for another pathogen that might be viral, bacterial, or fungal (Manohar et al., 2020). In this context, DENV2 and DENV4 have been reported to manifest an increased complications’ severity due to the possible secondary infections compared to the infections by other serotypes (i.e., 1, 3, and 5) (Kyle and Harris, 2008).</p>

positive RNA genome is a 5’-capped RNA (( 
+
)ssRNA). DENV was found to use human macrophages as host cells where it binds to the mannose-binding receptor (MR) and the dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) receptor (Lo et al., 2016). Once bound, the virus gets internalised via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, creating an endosome within the host cell’ s cytoplasm (Uno and Ross, 2018). The acidic environment of the endosome disrupts the envelop (E) protein leading to its fusion with the endosome membrane (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2005). Once the nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm, it dissociates, leaving the RNA to serve as a messenger-RNA (mRNA). The open reading frame (ORF) migrates to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and is translated into a large polyprotein. This polyprotein is cleaved co- and post-translationally into ten proteins (Bidet and Garcia-Blanco, 2018; Murugesan and Manoharan, 2020). This cleavage is hosted by two proteases; the host furin-type (or any other Golgi-localized proteases), and the viral serine protease embedded in the N-terminal domain of non-structural protein 3 (NS3pro). NS3pro requires non-structural protein 2b (NS2b) for its activity (Niyomrattanakit et al., 2004; Bollati et al., 2010). Upon cleavage, the N-terminus of the polyprotein yields the three structural proteins; E, prM, and C (Fig. 1). The rest of the N-terminus encodes seven non-structural (NS) proteins; NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5 (Fig. 2) (Niyomrattanakit et al., 2004; Bollati et al., 2010; Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010; Murugesan and Manoharan, 2020).

NS3 protein is a multifunctional protein that can act as a trypsin-like serine protease, ATPase, RTPase, and RNA helicase (Nasar et al., 2020). The N-terminus of NS3 (residues 1–180) is considered as the protease domain, while the rest of the protein (residues 180–618; the C-terminus) functions as the RNA helicase. Like any other trypsin-like serine protease, NS3pro has a catalytic triad which is made of HIS51, ASP75, and SER135 residues (Niyomrattanakit et al., 2004; Ganji and Kanyalkar, 2019). NS3pro was proven to require a co-factor; NS2b, for its functionality (Yusof et al., 2000; Leung et al., 2001), where NS2b provides structural stability for NS3pro and permits protein folding for a successful proteolytic activity (Leung et al., 2001). NS2b has a hydrophilic central region which behaves as a chaperone to stabilise the hydrophobic termini of NS3pro by surrounding it like a belt (Tomar et al., 2017). Both domains, the NS3pro and NS2b, are connected through a Gly 
4
-Ser-Gly 
4
linker (Leung et al., 2001; Luo et al., 2008). This NS2b/NS3pro is responsible for the cleavage of multiple proteins at the junctions of C-prM, NS2a-NS2b, NS2b-NS3, NS3-NS4a, and NS4b-NS5 (Tomar et al., 2017). Therefore, NS2b/NS3pro is a crucial enzyme complex for the proteolytic and cleavage activities of the translated polyprotein during the virus life cycle.

         <p>Several approaches were taken to prevent and limit DENV infections in the affected areas. These approaches vary between protective measures against the transmitting vectors and the search for infection inhibitors, whether they are synthesised chemical entities or isolates from natural sources. Thus, the search for antivirals from natural products continues. Noteworthy, multiple reviews were published earlier, covering isolated natural compounds’ activities towards DENV infections from prior to 2017 that we highly encourage researchers and readers to consider (Laille et al., 1998; Abd Kadir et al., 2013; Teixeira et al., 2014; Frederico et al., 2017; Oliveira et al., 2017). Throughout these reviews, multiple phytochemical classes were included from various plant families and species, covering all types of research approaches and multiple molecular targets.</p>

This review intends to highlight the most recent studies and advances from the past five years, discussing new findings of known natural products or phytochemicals which have not been studied and described previously as DENV protease potential inhibitors. Covered studies include 
in-silico, in-vitro,
and 
in-vivo
evaluations related to the use of these natural products extracted from various sources. Each reported natural product is given a number to facilitate its appearance throughout the paper. A more detailed insight on isolated phytochemicals and their related 
in-silico, in-vitro,
and 
in-vivo
activities are summarised in Table 1 by the end of Section 2.

Based on earlier findings where Papaya’ s (
<tp:taxon-name>
Carica papaya
</tp:taxon-name>
, family 
<tp:taxon-name>Caricaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) crude leaf extracts has been found to possess excellent antiDENV activity (Subenthiran et al., 2013; Adarsh et al., 2017; Shetty et al., 2019; Sarker et al., 2021), three fatty acids including oleic (1), stearic (2) and palmitic (3) acids (Fig. 3) were identified in the leaf extracts through GC-MS analysis. Induced-fit molecular docking studies showed a more favourable binding and a higher docking score of these fatty acids towards the 2M9P crystal structure of DENV2 NS2b/NS3pro compared to the 2FOM (Kutumbarao and Velmurugan, 2016). This effect might refer to the fact that 2FOM crystal structure has a gap in the loop region of the NS2b co-factor chain. Moreover, all the three compounds (1–3) were able to interact with the catalytic triad residues (HIS51, ASP75, and SER135), but not necessarily through hydrogen bonds, with (1) and (3) having nearly similar binding conformations at the active site of protease (Kutumbarao and Velmurugan, 2016).

Moreover, the MeOH extract of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lepisanthes fruticosa
</tp:taxon-name>
(family 
<tp:taxon-name>Sapindaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) pulp was assayed against DENV2 NS2b/NS3pro at concentrations between 1 and 10 mg/mL. Results indicated 70% and 93% inhibition at the tested concentrations, respectively, with an IC 
50
of 1.73 mg/mL. Compounds (2) and (3) were referred to be among the active specialised metabolites which were responsible for the DENV2 protease inhibitory activity of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. fruticosa
</tp:taxon-name>
as they contributed through a synergistic effect with two other flavonoids (Supian et al., 2021). Hence, this inhibitory activity against DENV2 NS2b/NS3pro was referred to the different structural flexibility in the NS2b co-factor domain. This means that the C-terminus of NS2b of DENV2, which provides some of the important residues in the main binding pocket of the protease, is susceptible to dissociation from the NS3 domain. This would benefit the DENV2 protease inhibitors as it impedes the correct alliance of the NS2b co-factor to the NS3 domain, which results in an inhibition of the DENV2 NS2b/NS3pro activity (Su et al., 2009; Supian et al., 2021).

<tp:taxon-name>
Syzygium grande
</tp:taxon-name>
(family 
<tp:taxon-name>Myrtaceae</tp:taxon-name>
), palmitic acid (3) was also identified as a major component among other secondary metabolites. Similarly, this fatty acid was thought to be responsible for the DENV2 protease inhibitory activity of the crude extracts, which was carried out 
in-vitro
and revealed more than 90% inhibition with IC 
50
’s of 3.77 μg/ mL for the leaf extract, and 5.23 μg/mL for the stem extract (Zakaria et al., 2019). These findings can be supported by the earlier work of Santoyo et al. (2010), whom thought that (3) could express a synergistic antiviral activity with other identified phytochemicals from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Himanthalia elongata
</tp:taxon-name>
(family 
<tp:taxon-name>Himanthaliaceae</tp:taxon-name>
), an edible seaweed, towards herpes simplex virus-1 (Santoyo et al., 2010). Still, and to our knowledge, no study was conducted considering (3) as a pure entity to be tested 
in-vitro
for its NS2b/NS3pro inhibitory activity. Hence, more studies are required to confirm these claims and 
in-silico
results.

Isolation and purification of the aq. fraction demonstrated the presence of three glucosides which are thought to be responsible for the anti-DENV activity of the plant. These glucosides included isobiflorin (4), biflorin (5), and eugeniin (6) (Fig. 4). The IC 
50

of 94.7 nM against DENV2 protease. Meanwhile, the chromone C-glucosides (4) and (5) demonstrated moderate inhibitions with IC 
50
’s of 58.9 and 89.6 μM, respectively.

Andrographolide (8) (Fig. 6, a) is a labdane diterpenoid isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Andrographis paniculata
</tp:taxon-name>
(green chiretta, family 
<tp:taxon-name>Acanthaceae</tp:taxon-name>
). Andrographolide (8) is well documented for its use as an antiviral agent against herpes simplex virus (Wiart et al., 2005; Seubsasana et al., 2011), human immunodeficiency virus (Calabrese et al., 2000; Niranjan Reddy et al., 2005), hepatitis B and C viruses (H. Chen et al., 2014; J.-C. Lee et al., 2014), and influenza virus (J.-X. Chen et al., 2009; B. Yu et al., 2014). A study by Panraksa et al. (2017) has investigated the inhibitory activity of andrographolide (8) against four serotypes of DENV (DENV1-4) in HepG2 and HeLa cell lines. Results indicated no cytotoxicity of the diterpenoid on both cell lines when tested at various concentrations up to 100 μM. However, it has been found that (8) has no direct virucidal effect on the DENV when incubated with it before introducing it to the cells. Further assessment has revealed that (8) succeeded in reducing the percentage of infected cells to below 20% at a concentration of 100 μM in HepG2 and HeLa cells with EC 
50
’s of 21.30 and 22.74 μM, respectively (Panraksa et al., 2017) and an IC 
50
of 51 μM in infected Vero cells (Tan et al., 2019). Dose-dependent reductions in DENV2’s and DENV4’s E and NS3 proteins expressions and virus titer were reported in both cell lines when supplied with (8) 3 h post-infection (Panraksa et al., 2017). These findings suggest that (8) can be considered as a potential antiviral agent that would manage DENV infections or minimise its replication into the host’ s cells. Thus, andrographolide (8) can be a focal point to study further its mechanism of action and its pharmacokinetics and toxicity.

evaluation of its activity along with a 95:5 mixture of satachyonic acid A (9) and stachyonic acid B against DENV infection in Vero cells was conducted. Results showed identical IC

Cytotoxicity evaluations in MCF7, SK-MEL-28, NFF, and Vero cells showed limited toxicity of the 95:5 stachyonic acid mixture compared to stachyonic acid A (9) alone and andrographolide (8). CC

         <p>It can be concluded that labdane terpenoids possess potent antiviral activity towards DENV. This activity varies according to the complexity of the compounds’ structures, along with its potential cytotoxicity.

(family

<tp:taxon-name>Ganodermataceae</tp:taxon-name>
. Traditionally, it is well known for its tonifying and antiaging effects and for enhancing memory, vital energy, and cardiac function (Wachtel-Galor et al., 2011). In the search for DENV NS2b/NS3pro inhibitors, Bharadwaj and co-workers conducted a virtual screening study on 22 known antiviral triterpenoids from 
<tp:taxon-name>
G. lucidum
</tp:taxon-name>
against the protease. All triterpenoids were seen to possess significant binding affinities towards the NS2b/NS3pro except for ganoderic acid G (structure not shown). Among the screened phytochemicals, ganodermanontriol (10) (6.29 kcal/mol), lucidumol A (11) (5.99 kcal/mol), ganoderic acid C2 (12) (5.95 kcal/mol), and ganosporeric acid A (13) (5.98 kcal/mol) (Fig. 7) were selected as potential inhibitors of DENV protease. All four triterpenoids displayed hydrogen bond interactions with the catalytic residues and other conserved residues (PHE130, TYR150, ASN152, and GLY153), which are known to play a crucial role in substrate binding for DENV protease. MM/GBSA calculations showed relatively negative energy values for all four docked complexes of 24.47, 19.74, 19.04, 11.45 kcal/mol for 10–13, respectively (Bharadwaj et al., 2019).

Therefore, (10) and (12) were selected for further 
in-vitro
investigations judging by their binding energy and complex stability through the molecular dynamics simulations. DENV2-infected A549 cell line was incubated with 25 or 50 μM of both compounds for 1 h. Results indicated 40 and 25% reductions in DENV2 titers at 50 and 25 μM, respectively, of ganodermanontriol (10). At the same time, there was no significant reduction in virus titers for ganoderic acid C2 (12) at both tested concentrations (Bharadwaj et al., 2019). Noteworthy, (10) has already been documented for its antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency-1 (Min et al., 1998), Epstein-Barr (Zheng and Chen, 2017), and influenza (Zhu et al., 2015) viruses.

Flavonoids (Fig. 8, a) are amongst the most extensively studied and reported phytochemical classes as inhibitors of DENV NS2b/NS3pro, especially quercetin (14) (Fig. 8, b). Most recently, quercetin (14) has been reported again in the leaf extract of papaya which is believed to contribute to the anti-DENV activity of the tested extracts besides the fatty acids (see 2.1) (Salim et al., 2018). Furthermore, (14) was also found to obstruct SER137 phosphorylation in NS3pro, which may reduce DENV replication (Alomair et al., 2021). Additionally, (14) was identified in 
<tp:taxon-name>

) bark extract and exhibited the most effective inhibition with an EC

of 19.2 μg/mL in DENV2-infected Vero cells when compared with other isolated compounds from the same extract (Trujillo-Correa et al., 2019).

Pongamol (15) (Fig. 8, c), on the other hand, is another flavonoid that was recently reported in Neem’ s extract. Regarding its anti-DENV activity, (9) was found to come next after gedunin (7) (see 2.3), comparing its affinity towards the tested human and DENV proteins (Rao and Yeturu, 2020). Another 
in-silico
study by Dwivedi and co-workers has evaluated the effectiveness of 49 Neem-derived flavonoids as potential inhibitors towards DENV2 NS2b/NS3pro. Molecular docking simulations revealed that kaempferol-3- 
O
-rutinoside (16), rutin (17), hyperoside (18), and epicatechin (19) (Fig. 8, b and d) expressed higher binding affinities towards the protease where their binding energies were 9.56, 9.32, 7.88, and 7.62 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 1), in comparison to quercetin (14) (positive control, 6.94 kcal/mol). Additionally, all flavonoids were found to occupy the same catalytic region at the protein’ s active site. Molecular dynamics simulation results revealed binding strength and stability of the systems on the catalytic triad of DENV2 NS2b/NS3pro, except for rutin (17) (Dwivedi et al., 2021). Herein, it must be highlighted that rutin (quercetin-3- 
O
-rutinoside) (17), a glycosidic derivative of quercetin (14), when tested 
in-vitro
for its anti-DENV activity, it did not show significant inhibition towards DENV2 in Vero cells and had a CC 
50
value of
&gt;
1000 μg/mL (Zandi et al., 2011) which agrees with Dwivedi et al. 
in-silico
findings.

Further 
in-vitro
cytotoxicity assessment was conducted for (16) and (19) using BHK-21 cell line. It was reported that (16) possessed no significant cytotoxicity at a concentration range of 10–100 μM, while (19) demonstrated 20% cytotoxicity at 1 mM. In comparison, quercetin (14) (control) exhibited 100% toxicity at 100 μM. Conversely, the antiviral findings showed that (16) possessed maximum inhibition of 75.7% and 77.7% at 10 and 100 μM, respectively. In contrast, (19) exhibited a maximum inhibition of 66.2% towards the DENV2 infectivity at 1000 μM. Based on these 
in-silico
and 
in-vitro
findings, it was proposed that (16) and (19) are potential inhibitors of DENV2 NS2b/NS3pro (Dwivedi et al., 2021). Interestingly, (19) and (17) are the two flavonoids that are believed to contribute through a synergistic activity with fatty acids (2) and (3) in Supian et al. study described earlier (see 2.1) (Supian et al., 2021).

Amentoflavone (21) is a biflavone that can be found in several plant families, such as

<tp:taxon-name>Calophyllaceae (S. Yu et al., 2017)</tp:taxon-name>
. An 
in-silico
study was initiated in 2020 to study 107 flavonoids from 47 plants as potential inhibitors for DENV protease. AutoDock was used to study the binding of the selected flavonoids against DENV1 and DENV4 proteases. Molecular docking results revealed that amentoflavone (21) (Fig. 8, e), quercetin-3- 
O
-β- D-glucopyranoside, liquiritinapioside, silybin, and avicularin, ascendingly according to their binding energies (15.8 to 14.6 kcal/mol), were the lead flavonoids which bound to DENV1 protease. Similarly, amentoflavone (21), silymarin, avicularin, reynoutrin, and quercetin-3- 
O
-β- D-glucopyranoside, ascendingly according to their binding energies (16.8 to 15.7 kcal/mol), were the lead flavonoids which bound to DENV4 protease (Jayadevappa et al., 2020). In the same study, the lead compound (21) was subjected to an 
in-vitro
high-throughput protease assay. It also was measured for its cell cytotoxicity using HepG2 cells at various concentrations ranging from 5 to 25 μM. Quercetin (14) was used as a positive control in both 
in-vitro
assays concentration. Amentoflavone (21) showed 53% inhibition of the DENV protease at a concentration of 25 μM compared to (14), which showed 63% inhibition at the same concentration. Amentoflavone (21) showed 20% toxicity at its highest tested concentration (25 μM), compared to (14), which had 40% toxicity at a similar concentration (Jayadevappa et al., 2020). An earlier study showed that amentoflavone (21) was also able to possess its anti-DENV activity by inhibiting the DENV NS5 RdRp (Coulerie et al., 2013). Hence, amentoflavone (21) is able to express its anti-DENV activity through its dual action on the NS2b/NS3pro and the NS5 RdRp.

Curcumin (22) (Fig. 8, f) is a flavonoid polyphenol that is present in abundance in turmeric (
<tp:taxon-name>
Curcuma longa
</tp:taxon-name>
, family 
<tp:taxon-name>Zingiberaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) and has a limited bioavailability. Regarding its anti-DENV activity, (22) has been studied for its binding to the DENV2 NS2b/NS3pro as an allosteric inhibitor. 
In-vitro
enzymatic assay has shown an IC 
50
of 7.18 μM and a 
Ki
of 4.35 μM. In the same study, it was noticed that since curcumin (22) inhibited DENV2 NS2b/NS3pro by changing 
Vmax
but not 
Km
, it was an indication that (22) acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme (L. Lim et al., 2020). Additionally, two 
in-vitro
studies scrutinised the anti-DENV2 activity of (22) in BHK-21 and Vero cell lines. Findings showed an EC 
50
of 13.95 μM in BHK-21 cells. On the other hand, the CC 
50
of (22) in DENV2-infected BHK-21 cells was 49.01 μM, while the highest safe concentration against Vero cells was 6.25 ppm (Marbawati and Umniyati, 2015; Balasubramanian et al., 2019). Molecular docking studies on the binding mode of (22) towards the DENV2 NS2b/NS3pro showed that the amino acid residues which construct the binding cavity of where curcumin (22) is bound do not overlap with the catalytic triad residues of the enzyme. This suggests that (22) can bind non-competitively to DENV2 protease at an allosteric binding site. Furthermore, molecular dynamics studies of the enzyme in its bound and unbound states indicated that (22) has caused conformational changes to NS2b, but not to the NS3 chain. That observation was a conformational hint to the NMR results from the same study. NMR results showed that once (22) binds to the DENV2 protease, the NS2b co-factor acts more dynamically in comparison to the NS3 domain of the enzyme (L. Lim et al., 2020). The same allosteric binding pocket was found in the Zika virus’ s NS2b/NS3pro (Roy et al., 2017).

of 22.3 μM and a 
Ki
of 4.7 μM (de Sousa et al., 2015). Myricetin (23) was assayed against DENV2 protease to find that its IC

is 8.46 μM while having a 
Ki
value of 4.92 μM, which agrees with the previous study. Through the NMR study, (23) was found to bind to two different allosteric sites where one of them is where curcumin (22)

binds in the inactive form of the enzyme. Yet, in this inactive form of the DENV2 protease, it was noticed that (23) was able to interact only with certain NS3 residues, including VAL72-ASP75, THR118-THR122, GLY151-VAL154, and ALA160-ALA166. However, in the active form of the DENV2 NS2b/NS3pro, myricetin (23) was found to bind only to one of the allosteric sites, leaving the allosteric site of curcumin (22) untouched (Dang et al., 2022). Molecular dynamics simulations of myricetin (23) in complex with the active form of DENV2 protease were executed, furtherly. Myricetin (23) binding to the protease has resulted in a significant increase of conformational dynamics in the NS2b co-factor, but only a trivial change in the NS3 domain. Moreover, simulation results suggested that the inactive form of the protease is less dynamic in comparison with the active form, while the binding of two myricetin (23) molecules to DENV2 NS2b/NS3pro inactive

locked the conformational dynamics of both NS3 domain and its co-factor (Dang et al., 2022).

of 82.82 μM (Hengphasatporn et al., 2021). Noteworthy, two earlier studies showed that (24) was able to bind to the DENV NS2b/NS3pro with decent binding energy values ranging between 7.7 and 6.62 kcal/mol while forming five hydrogen bond interactions (Shanmugapriya et al., 2016; Ghosh and Talukdar, 2019). Thus, apigenin (24) can be a potential inhibitor for the DENV protease, which requires further investigation.

in type I and II interferon deficient 129/Sv mice (Peng et al., 2017). It was confirmed later that one of the prospected targets of (25) is the DENV NS22/NS3pro, where it yielded a lowest energy of binding of 7.7 kcal/mol (Ghosh and Talukdar, 2019). Thus, luteolin (25) is another flavonoid that can act as a potential inhibitor of DENV protease.

Their antiviral effect was found to be virucidal, acting on the virus itself in a dose-dependent manner, and not through altering the endosomal pH of cells and affecting the virus fusion. Similarly, (26) and (29) were found to demonstrate virucidal effects against WNV and Zika virus (V´azquez-Calvo et al., 2017).

100 μM. However, quercetin (14) and rotenone (30) showed a significant reduction in cell viability of approximately 40% and less at the same concentration. This suggested that the inhibitory effect of the latter compounds was due to cell toxicity. Thus, they were excluded from further assessment. Moreover, EGCG (29) was found to express 50% and above inhibition towards DENV2 at concentrations between 30 and 100 μM. On the other hand, epicatechin gallate (structure not shown) was less potent where it only had its inhibitory effects at doses of more than 60 μM. RT-PCR and RNA measurements revealed that (29) inhibits the viral entry into the cell by acting on the virus particle itself and not the host cells. Besides, the EC

’s were found to be at 14.8, 18.0, 11.2, and 13.6 μM for DENV1-4, respectively. Although (29) possessed excellent

’s of (32) and (33) were calculated as 4.7 and 55.7 μM, respectively. Tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy allowed the researchers to calculate KD values of both flavonoids as 18.7 and 20.9 μM for hesperetin (32) and hesperidin (33), respectively. Further molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to show that both molecules bind to a hydrophobic allosteric pocket of NS3pro that is located near the NS2b co-factor interaction area. Hesperetin (32) was found to bind with a binding energy of 23.1 kcal/mol, whereas hesperidin (33) binds at

37.4 kcal/mol (Eberle et al., 2021b). Consequently, these flavonoids exhibit promising anti-DENV activity towards the virus protease via a non-competitive mechanism of action. Further 
in-vivo
and clinical evaluations are highly encouraged to investigate their cytotoxicity and potential adverse effects.

Gallic acid (31) (Fig. 9, a) was among the screened natural product in the study of Raekiansyah et al. (2018). At 100 μM (~17 μg/mL) concentration, (31) was able to inhibit DENV2 infection in Vero cells by 95% while maintaining cell viability at around 50% (Raekiansyah et al., 2018). Hence, this also suggested that the inhibitory effect of (31) was due to cell toxicity at the tested concentration. One year later, Trujillo-Correa and co-workers were able to identify the presence of (31) 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. guajava
</tp:taxon-name>
bark extract. Through their 
in-vitro
testing in DENV2-infected Vero cells, (31) decreased viral infection significantly when supplied pre-DENV2 infection by 52.6%. In contrast, (31) inhibited DENV2 infection in Vero cells by 67.3% when supplied post-DENV2 infection. Noteworthy, the CC 
50
of (31) was found at 543.4 μg/mL and its EC 
50
at 25.8 μg/mL (Trujillo-Correa et al., 2019). These conflicting results might be a result of the incubation time performed in each experiment. In the study by Raekiansyah et al., the incubation period was carried out for five days, whereas in Trujillo-Correa et al. study, the incubation period was 24 h only. This leaves the door open for more investigations on the effectiveness of gallic acid (31), its molecular target, and how its cytotoxicity can relate to its anti-DENV activity.

         <p>Methyl orsellinate (34) (Fig. 9, a) was among the few compounds screened by Sulaiman et al. (2019) for their inhibitory activity towards DENV2 NS2b/NS3pro. Results showed that (34) possessed only 16.42% inhibition. Thus, it was excluded from further investigations. Nonetheless, gallic acid (31) and methyl orsellinate (34) share the same chemical scaffold as phenols, yet both seem ineffective in inhibiting DENV NS2b/NS3pro. Therefore, further assessment is required to study these molecules and other natural products that share the same scaffold on other molecular targets in the DENV, such as C and E proteins.</p>

Resveratrol (35) (Fig. 9, a) is a naturally occurring non-flavonoid polyphenol known for its beneficial biological effects on the human body. Resveratrol (35) is found in multiple plant sources, including and most famously, mulberries (
<tp:taxon-name>
Morus alba

<tp:taxon-name>Moraceae</tp:taxon-name>
), peanuts (

<tp:taxon-name>
Vitis vinifera
</tp:taxon-name>
, family 
<tp:taxon-name>Vitaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) (Kulkarni and Cant´o, 2015). This polyphenol has been studied for its anti-DENV activity in Huh7 cells, where the cells were treated with (35) pre- and post-DENV2 infection. There was a significant reduction in the viral titer in the treated group at various concentrations, especially at 80 and 100 μM, with no significant cytotoxic effects. Western blot analyses revealed a decrement in DENV2 NS3 production. Additionally, inductions of INF-β levels and activation of MxA and ISG56 were noticed. Resveratrol (35) was also found to inhibit the HMGB1 via induction of SIRT1 (Zainal et al., 2017). It is noteworthy that (35) was also able to inhibit Zika virus in Huh7 cells. Resveratrol (35) managed to reduce the viral foci formation by up to 97% at a concentration of 100 μM with 99% cell viability (Mohd et al., 2019). However, some synthesised analogues of (35) affected viral RNA translation and replication. Yet, the actual mechanism of how (35) expresses its anti-DENV activity is still to be elucidated further (Han et al., 2017). It is worth mentioning that (35) is a helicase inhibitor of hepatitis C virus that belongs to the same family of DENV (S. Lee et al., 2016).

Gingerol (36) (Fig. 9, a) is a phenolic compound abundantly found in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zingiberaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family. It has been studied for its antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and anticancer effects (C.-Y. Chen et al., 2018; Liang et al., 2018; Nafees et al., 2021). An earlier study showed that (36) expressed a virucidal effect towards Chikungunya virus in HepG2 cells with no cytotoxic effects at concentrations of less than 0.2 mM (Hayati et al., 2021). Recently, a molecular docking study by Rahman et al. (2021) showed that (36) was able to bind to DENV NS2b/NS3pro with a binding energy of 6.1 kcal/mol (Rahman et al., 2021). Whereas 
in-vitro
investigation of (36) in DENV1-infected A549 cells demonstrated an IC 
50
of 0.032 mM when supplied after viral entry, and an IC 
50
of 0.038 mM on full-time treatment. Therefore, gingerol (36) holds the potential as an inhibitor towards DENV infections. However, further 
in-vitro
investigations are required on other cell lines infected with various serotypes of DENV, which would allow a deeper insight on the molecular mechanism by which (36) expresses its anti-DENV activity.

A mixture of phenolic lipids was characterised in the cashew’ s nutshell and was found to consist mainly of anacardic acid, cardanol, and cardol head groups with saturated, monoene, diene, and triene tails. These phenolic lipids were assayed for their anti-DENV2 activity in Vero cells at 10 and 25 μM. DENV2 was inhibited by 97.95, 65.30, and 95.91% at 10 μM of anacardic acid (37) (Fig. 9, a), cardanol, and cardol, respectively. However, at 25 μM all phenolic lipids inhibited the virus by 
≥
99%. Anacardic and cardol trienes showed the highest CC 
50
’s of 115.13 and 207.30 μM, respectively. Interestingly, an inverse relationship was found between the degree of saturation of the hydrocarbon tails of the molecules and their CC 
50
’s. Cardol triene (38) (Fig. 9, a) alone was further investigated in THP-1, HEK-293, and HepG2 cells for its cytotoxicity. A higher CC 
50
value of (38) indicated its safety. In addition, the saturated anacardic acid (37) was found to possess the highest activity among the anacardic acid homologues with an EC 
50
of 4.31 μM and a lower CC 
50
of 66.33 μM, indicating possible cytotoxicity. In contrast, (38) showed an EC 
50
value of 7.13 μM while having the highest CC 
50
of 207.30 μM. RT-PCR results showed that (38) was able to decrease intracellular RNA and virion particles in the early and late stages of infections (1- and 48-h measurements) (Kanyaboon et al., 2018).

An earlier study by Hundt et al. (2015) investigated the antiviral activity of anacardic acid (37) on hepatitis C virus, which belongs to the same family of DENV and Zika virus; 
<tp:taxon-name>Flaviviridae</tp:taxon-name>
. The study demonstrated that (37) affected hepatitis C virus entry, replication, translation, and secretion in a dose-dependent manner with no significant cytotoxic effects (Hundt et al., 2015). Yet, the effects of these polyphenols and their lipids have to be investigated on other targets in the

<tp:taxon-name>Flavivirus</tp:taxon-name>
infections. Further assessment involving (39) was carried out at a concentration range between 2.5 and 10 μM. Tatanan A (39) possessed negligible cytotoxicity on the tested cell line. On the other hand, its inhibitory activity towards DENV was dosedependent with an EC 
50
of 3.9 μM. Tatanan A (39) exhibited its activity by targeting DENV2’s mRNA when given post-infection to the cells. It was found to inhibit DENV2 replication in stages between posttranslation and viral RNA genome replication, most noticeably at 2 h post-infection. RT-PCR showed that (39) reduced the expression of E and NS1 proteins (Yao et al., 2018). Yet, further investigations are required on other cell lines, which would assess its cytotoxicity furtherly, and assess its effectiveness as a protease inhibitor.

Melatonin (40) (Fig. 10, a) is an acetamide hormone that is secreted by the pineal gland to regulate the circadian rhythm. It was documented that (40) was also detected in various medicinal and dietary plants such as apples, barley, beans, cucumber, grapes, lupine, maize, potatoes, rice, and tomatoes, among others (Salehi et al., 2019b). It has been reported that melatonin (40) at concentrations of 1000, 500, and 250 μM (which were determined to be as subtoxic concentrations) decreased the viral titer in DENV2-infected Huh7 cells by 99.77, 98.11, and 95.62%, respectively. These findings were compared to 
N
-acetyl cysteine (used as a reference, 20 mM), which only reduced the viral titer by 73.65%. The IC 
50
of (40) was 134.9 μM, while no significant change in cell viability was noticed. Nonetheless, (40) reduced the viral titer in four serotypes of DENV (DENV1-4) with various inhibitory levels, plus in other cell lines besides the Huh7, namely, A549, EA.hy.926, and U937. Melatonin (40) inhibited DENV replication and production at the post-entry stage. This was concluded as cell line experiments showed no effect of (40) when supplied at the pre- or co-infection stages. The mechanism of action on how (40) inhibits the DENV infection is not fully understood. However, and through RT-PCR, it is suspected that (40) affects RNA and protein translation. Yet, it was found that the antiviral activity of (40) is partly originated from its ability to activate the SIRT1 pathway (Morchang et al., 2021).

         <p>On the contrary, melatonin (40) was assayed against DENV2 virus in HEK293T/17 and HepG2 cell lines at concentrations between 0.0001 and 10 mM. A slight inhibitory effect was noticed in HEK293T/17 cells, while no inhibitory effects were seen in HepG2. Thus, it was concluded that (40) increased the burden of DENV infection (Paemanee et al., 2018). These inconsistent findings raise a massive question about the efficacy of melatonin (40) towards DENV infections. However, these differences might be referred to the different cell lines which were used in each study, the multiplicity of infection, melatonin (40) concentration, or the followed procedure.</p>

<tp:taxon-name>

Invitro
assessment against DENV2 NS2b/NS3pro showed that (41) was able to inhibit the protease by 61.23%, with an IC 
50
of 403.14 μM. Molecular docking showed that (41) was inferior with its binding affinity towards NS2b/NS3pro to the binding affinities of epicatechin (19) and catechin (27), which were also identified in the same extract. Herein, (41) demonstrated the weakest binding affinity as it managed to bind through two hydrogen bonds only at the S1 subpocket (Sulaiman et al., 2019). This weak binding affinity and inferior percentage of inhibition of (41) might be influenced by the long unsaturated aliphatic chain that the compound bears.

These concentrations were based on the cytotoxicity of each plant and were chosen to achieve cell viability of at least 90%. Further measurements of the viral titer and foci formation showed that

These interesting findings of

’s peptide extract allowed them to explore the DENV-inhibitory activity of this extract towards four serotypes of DENV (DENV1-4). The inhibitory activity was most potent in DENV3, while the least inhibitory effect was seen in DENV2. Four peptides, 15-amino acids in length, were characterised and identified in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. catechu
</tp:taxon-name>
peptide extract using HPLC and LC-MS/MS (structures not shown). All four peptides were found to share the same N-terminus sequence of ASP–HIS–VAL-THR-PRO-ASP-ILE-ALA-TYR-ASN-PRO, which is thought to be a feature responsible for their activity as antiDENV. Moreover, confirmational anti-DENV testing of these isolated peptides was conducted. No signs of cytotoxicity have been noticed at doses between 0.01 μM and 1 mM. Only two peptides were found to be responsible for the anti-DENV activity, which was judged by measuring foci reduction (Panya et al., 2019).

Results of Panya et al. showed a broader focus on natural-sourced isolated peptides and proteins, which are believed to be the future of medicine, instead of looking only at small molecules. However, further assessment is required to study the target of these peptides and how they act and behave on a molecular level. Thus, further initiatives with these peptides can be undertaken for 
in-vivo
or through clinical trials.

Both peptides possessed hydrogen bond interactions with HIS and SER residues while maintaining non-bonded interactions with other residues at the binding pocket. Additionally, both peptides were found to interact with both chains of the protease; NS2b and NS3, with a binding conformation that is very similar to that of the co-crystallised control molecule. Molecular dynamics studies of the peptides revealed a consistent binding throughout the whole 30 ns of simulations (Kutumbarao and Velmurugan, 2016).</p>

Although herbal remedies and folklore medicine still have a great influence in many cultures around the world, there is no herbal medicine or supplement that has been developed and approved for the treatment and management of DENV infections (Trujillo-Correa et al., 2019; Dhiman et al., 2022). Still, many of the aforementioned phytochemicals have already been standardised and commercially available for various indications and not specifically for DENV infections. This agrees with our personal communication with a number of community pharmacies (Penang, Malaysia – July 2022) that DENV-infected people can alleviate some of their symptoms and strengthen their immune systems via a group of micronutrients (zinc, vitamin C, and vitamin D) and sometimes by using some of the commercially available herbal supplements, which include papaya leaf extracts, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma lucidum
</tp:taxon-name>
extracts, curcumin, berberine, and resveratrol. Additionally, grapefruit seed extract that is rich in flavonoids (especially naringenin) is also being used for the management of DENV infections in some countries based on evidence published earlier in 2017 (Frabasile et al., 2017).

A recent article by NutraIngredients-Asia was published announcing that a nutraceutical and functional food company from New Zealand was planning to launch their papaya supplement that is to be used as an adjunctive treatment of DENV infections. The supplement is extracted from the papaya variant 

“ 
Wakatengu
”

which is known for its high content of polyphenols and micronutrients (Koe, 2021). Moreover, another study was published recently claiming the formulation tablets of 
<tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia serrata
</tp:taxon-name>
(family 
<tp:taxon-name>Burseraceae</tp:taxon-name>
) extracts for the management of DENV infections. 
In-vitro
assessment of the tablets’ content release revealed 96.61% and 97.22% was released of each plant extract, respectively, at 120 min (Bhatia and Pansare, 2021). Noteworthy, 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. serrata

is known for preventing thrombocytopenia due to its boswellic acid content (Tawfik, 2016).

These formulations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. papaya
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf extracts and their use for DENV management can be attributed to the clinical study that was conducted in south India on 100 patients with confirmed cases of DENV infections to assess the effects of 1500 mg per day, peroral, of papaya leaf extract (formulated as capsules) on their medical condition. Results showed a significant increase in platelet count and a reduced need for platelet transfusion in the study group. Except for some gastrointestinal disturbances, no significant side effects were noticed (Adarsh et al., 2017). A similar finding was seen in another clinical study with thirty DENV-infected children (age 1–16 years old) where the dosage regimen was between 825 and 3300 mg per day, according to the child’ s age, for five days (Shetty et al., 2019). Although these studies showed a potential anti-DENV activity of papaya leaves, more research is required to monitor the effectiveness of different dosage regimens and to assess the possible acute and chronic adverse effects of papaya leaves’ extracts on the human body on an extended duration of treatment. In addition, more studies are required to isolate and investigate other active components which might contribute to the anti-DENV activity of papaya leaves.

In contrast, andrographolide was reported for its extremely poor solubility in acidic and alkaline aqueous environments, which impacts its bioavailability if administered orally (Malarvizhi, 2019). This has led to the formulation of various pharmaceutical preparations, including microspheres, microemulsion, liposomes, niosomes, and nanoparticles, and were reviewed recently by Adiguna and co-workers (Adiguna et al., 2021). Similarly, curcumin was reported for its poor solubility and rapid hydrolysis which makes it also of low bioavailability. Many efforts were taken to formulate curcumin into a suitable oral formulation. In light of the current topic, a research paper was published in 2020 claiming the encapsulation of curcumin in a nanoemulsion that is targeted against DENV. Results showed that nano-formulated curcumin exhibited higher 
in-vitro
cytotoxicity which was referred to the higher cellular uptake of the active compound. Regardless, no significant difference was noticed between the nano-formula and curcumin solution in supressing DENV infectivity and replication where curcumin was shown to be mostly effective against DENV1 and DENV2 serotypes (Nabila et al., 2020).

         <p>Furthermore, although herbal supplements are available commercially as adjunctive options for the management of varssious symptoms and conditions, the regulations and quality control measurements are not as strict as chemically synthesised drugs (Balekundri and Mannur, 2020). Herbal medicines are usually taken without enough supervision and in inconsistent concentration. This can highly impact the efficacy and safety of herbal preparations due to the presence of contaminants and other biologically active phytochemicals, especially in the case of crude extracts, which might be carcinogenic, mutagenic, or genotoxic (van Wyk and Prinsloo, 2020). Most importantly, people taking herbal medicines in conjunction with their medicines for the management of various health conditions are usually not paying enough attention towards the possible herb-drug interactions which might occur (Brantley et al., 2014). Therefore, regulations for herbal medicines are essential to minimise the discrepancies in the methods followed to prepare, formulate, and advertise for herbal products, which would ensure quality, safety, and efficacy of the final product (Sahoo et al., 2010).</p>

         <p>In 2004, guidelines for the regulation of herbal medicines in the South-East Asia Region were put. These guidelines classified herbal medicines into four categories; indigenous herbal medicines, herbal medicines in systems, modified herbal medicines, and imported products with a herbal medicine base. For each category, the minimum requirements for assessment of safety and efficacy of herbal medicines were specified. On one hand, major safety concerns which shall be provided as part of the regulations to commercialise a herbal medicine include acute and long-term toxicities, organ-targeted toxicity, immunotoxicity, embryo/fetal and prenatal toxicity, mutagenicity/genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. On the other hand, these guidelines specified the quality assurance, pharmacovigilance, and control of advertisements for any herbal medicinal product (WHO, 2004). Later in 2006, the International Regulatory Cooperation for Herbal Medicines (IRCH) global network was established by members representing sixteen countries. IRCH aims to maintain the quality and safety of herbal medicines through improved regulations. By 2017, the total number of IRCH members became thirty-four, including thirty-one countries and three regional and sub-regional parties, which include the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the European Medicines Agency, and the Latin American Parliament (WHO, 2022). A comprehensive and detailed summary of the regulations of herbal and complementary medicines was published earlier, covering all regions and countries around the globe (Reddy and Alex, 2017).</p>

Nature is a rich source of natural compounds that can be used to manage various ailments and infectious diseases. This review has described the recent discoveries in anti-DENV potentials of recently reported isolated phytochemicals and peptides. Except for very few, these isolated natural products were tested against DENV NS2b/NS3pro. Their testing included mostly 
in-silico
and 
in-vitro
experimentation. Thus, more investigations are required towards the compounds which were not verified for their type of inhibitory activity and their molecular target.

On the other hand, most of the reported isolated compounds are flavonoids, which show great potentials (except for rutin) to be developed and studied further as DENV protease inhibitors. Quercetin, curcumin, and myricetin were found to act as non-competitive allosteric inhibitors of the protease, raising a massive question about the activity of the flavonoids chemical scaffold as if they all act as non-competitive DENV protease inhibitors. This question can be answered by studying the (quantitative)-structure-activity relationship of compounds of this phytochemical class. Only two compounds were isolated from nature for the first time and were identified as anti-DENV; which include a flavanone glycoside from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Faramea bahiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, and a benzofuranone derivative from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Endiandra kingiana
</tp:taxon-name>
, which kinetically are still to be determined whether they are competitive or non-competitive inhibitors. This type of study can be achieved through studying their 
in-vitro
inhibition behaviour with various concentrations of the compounds at multiple concentrations of the substrate. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations would provide a tremendous contribution to investigate the behaviour of these molecules when bound to the protease and at which binding pocket they would bind with higher affinity.

The three fatty acids which were studied and discussed recently, their results are still not conclusive. This was concluded as, up to our knowledge, they were not studied as pure isolated chemical entities, and they were only investigated 
in-silico
and 
in-vitro
as part of crude extracts from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Syzygium grande
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lepisanthes fruticosa
</tp:taxon-name>
. However, eugeniin (a glucoside) was the most potent with an IC 
50
in the nanoscale. This might be influenced by the large molecular weight of eugeniin in comparison to the other recently reported glucosides and the abundance of the hydroxyl groups that act as hydrogen bond donors. These reasons can also apply for the interesting DENV inhibitory activities of some phenolic compounds including tatanan A (for its relatively large molecular weight), and resveratrol, anacardic acid, and cardol triene (for the presence of the hydrogen bond donors in their chemical structures). Moreover, building a pharmacophore using the chemical scaffold of the two diterpenoids (stachyonic acid A and andrographolide) can be an interesting starting point to screen libraries and databases for compounds which can match the pharmacophore and test them for their cytotoxicities and anti-DENV activities.

Still, a greater focus is highly encouraged towards tannins, alkaloids, stilbenoids, and coumarins of natural sources. Moreover, derivatives of these natural products can be designed and synthesised, which could enhance their specificity and efficacy towards the protease. Further investigations are also encouraged using cardol triene, tatanan A, pongamol, gedunin, and melatonin towards DENV NS2b/NS3pro as they were only investigated on other viral targets or without specifying a molecular target, according to our knowledge. Noteworthy, natural isolated peptides that were recently tested include four peptides from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Acacia catechu
</tp:taxon-name>
and two from fish. Most of the studies described in this review were conducted using natural products from plant extracts. Nevertheless, other sources of natural products, such as fungi, bacterial toxins, marine organisms, and animals, should also be explored towards discovering DENV NS2b/NS3pro inhibitors.

Our review was designed to cover the recent advance in discovering the efficacy of natural products in the management of DENV infection with a special emphasis towards its protease; NS2b/NS3pro. Throughout the conducted work, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar were searched with the following keywords: “natural products”; “polyphenols”; “flavonoids”; terpenes”; “peptides”; “dengue”; “dengue protease”; “protease inhibitors”; “NS2b-NS3pro”; and “ 
flavivirus
”. Databases were searched between November 2021 and April 2022 for research papers published in 2017 and later. Only English research papers were included in the current review as long as they are within the topic of interest. Published work primarily focused on synthesised derivatives from natural products was excluded. Moreover, scientific papers discussing the activity of natural products on DENV infections on other molecular targets were minimised to keep the general focus of the current review towards protease inhibitors.
