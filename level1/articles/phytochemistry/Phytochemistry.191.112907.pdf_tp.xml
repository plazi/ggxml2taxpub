         <p> Seven undescribed 22-hydroxylanostane triterpenoids were isolated from the fruiting
            bodies of <tp:taxon-name> Phellinus igniarius </tp:taxon-name> , together with three
            known sterols. Their structures were assigned by extensive spectroscopic and HRESIMS
            data analyses. The absolute configurations of C-22 were determined by X-ray
            crystallography, chemical methods, and spectroscopic data comparison. Phellinol G was a
            25,26,27-trinorlanostane triterpenoid glycoside. 22 S /22 R - 25,26,27-
            Trinorlanosta-8-en-3 β ,22,24-triols with the same side chain as that of phellinol G
            were stereoselectively synthesized from commercial lanosterol for the first time. The
            key step involved Sharpless asymmetrical epoxidation. Phellinols A, B, and F showed
            cardioprotective activity against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation injury in
            H9c2 cells at a concentration of 20 μ M. </p>

         <title> 1. Introduction </title>
         <p> The macromycete <tp:taxon-name> Phellinus igniarius </tp:taxon-name> (L.) Qu´el, (
               <tp:taxon-name>Hymenochaetaceae</tp:taxon-name> ) usually hosts on trunks of conifers
            or broadleaf trees, and leads to white rot on timbers ( ). The fruiting bodies of
               <tp:taxon-name> P. igniarius </tp:taxon-name> , called “Sanghuang” in Chinese, have
            been historically used as a folk medicine for the treatment of endometrorrhagia in
            gynecology ( ). In recently years, they have been used as auxiliary antitumor
            supplements in Asian countries ( ). Previous chemical investigations on the fruiting
            bodies of <tp:taxon-name> P. igniarius </tp:taxon-name> have led to the identification
            of structure interesting styrylpyrones ( ; , ) with anti-oxidative and cytotoxic
            activities, as well as other phenolic compounds ( , , ) and diterpenoids ( ).
            Additionally, several sterols and sesquiterpenoids were identified from the cultures of
               <tp:taxon-name> P. igniarius </tp:taxon-name> ( ; ; ) with significant antiviral and
            vascular-relaxing activities. </p>
         <p> Cardioprotection refers to reduce the injury from myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion
            ( ). The current cardioprotection methods mainly include non-pharmacological
            interventions and pharmaceutical treatments. At present, the clinical used drugs are not
            ideal, and the discovery of an effective cardioprotective drug that can be given before
            or at reperfusion is still demanding ( ). As a continuation of our interests in the
            chemistry and bioactivity of macromycetes ( ), a chemical investigation on the fruiting
            bodies of <tp:taxon-name> P. igniarius </tp:taxon-name> led to the isolation of seven
            previously undescribed 22-hydroxylanstane triterpenoids, phellinols A-G ( 1–7 ), along
            with three known sterols 8–10 . The absolute configurations of C-22 were determined by
            X-ray crystallographic analysis, chemical methods, and comparison with the reported
            spectroscopic data. The cardioprotective activity of compounds 1–10 was evaluated.
            Herein, we describe the isolation, structure elucidation, and cardioprotective activity
            of these isolated compounds. </p>

         <p> The methanolic extract of <tp:taxon-name> P. igniarius </tp:taxon-name> was subjected
            to column chromatography over MCI CHP20P, silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, ODS, and high
            performance liquid chromatography purification to yield seven undescribed
            22-hydroxylanostane triterpenoids, phellinols A-G ( 1–7 ), together with three known
            sterols ( 8–10 ) ( Fig. 1 ). The known compounds were identified as ergosta-7,22-diene-3
            β -ol ( 8 ) ( ), ergosta-7,22-diene-3- one ( 9 ) ( ), and phellinignincisterol C ( 10 )
            ( ), by comparison of their spectroscopic data with those reported in literatures. </p>

         <p> Compound 1 was isolated as a colorless needle. Its molecular formula was determined to
            be C 30 H 46 O 3 by the positive HRESIMS. The 1 H NMR spectrum of 1 showed the signals
            of two olefinic protons at δ H 6.77 (d, J = 6.9 Hz, H-7) and 5.28 (d, J = 5.9 Hz, H-11),
            two oxygenated methines at δ H 3.24 (dd, J = 11.6, 4.2 Hz, H-3) and 3.91 (m, H-22), one
            secondary methyl at δ H 0.96 (d, J = 6.6 Hz, H 3 -21), and seven tertiary methyls at δ H
            0.69 (s, H 3 -18), 0.98 (s, H 3 -19), 1.23 (s, H 3 -26), 1.24 (s, H 3 -27), 1.01 (s, H 3
            -28), 0.88 (s, H 3 -29), and 1.07 (s, H 3 -30). The 13 C NMR spectrum of 1 displayed 30
            carbons, including a carbonyl carbon at δ C 217.4 (C-15), four olefinic carbons at δ C
            124.3 (C-7), 135.1 (C-8), 146.3 (C-9), and 114.6 (C-11), five sp 3 -hybrid methines, two
            of which at δ C 78.9 (C-3) and 80.4 (C-22) were oxygenated, seven methylenes, eight
            methyls, and five sp 3 -hybrid quaternary carbons, including an oxygenated at δ C 80.1
            (C-25). The above spectroscopic data were close to those of ganodercochlearin A ( ),
            which possesses a tetrahydrofuran ring in the side chain. The major difference was
            arisen from the carbonylation of C-15 instead of the hydroxylation of C-24. The chemical
            shift of H-16 ( δ H 2.54, 2.06) and the HMBC correlations from H 3 -30 and H-17 to C-15
            ( Fig. 2 ) revealed a carbonyl group was located at C-15. The up-field shift of C-23 (Δ
            δ C 2.5 ppm), C-24 (Δ δ C 39.7 ppm), and C-25 (Δ δ C 1.6 ppm) in comparison with those
            of ganodercochlearin A indicated the disappearance of a hydroxyl substituent on C-24.
            Further detailed COSY and HMBC correlations analysis ( Fig. 2 ) established the planar
            structure of 1 , 3-hydroxy-22,25- epoxylanosta-7,9 (11)-dien-15-one. The NOE
            correlations of H-3/H 3 -28 and H-3/H-5 suggested that H-3 was α - oriented. Though H-22
            exhibited obviously NOE interactions with H-16 α and H-16 β , the absolute configuration
            of C-22 cannot be unambiguously concluded based solely on this information. However, by
            using single crystal XRD analysis conducted with Cu Kα radiation ( Fig. 3 , CCDC,
            2077919), the absolute configuration of C-22 was determined to be R . Thus, the
            structure of 1 was elucidated as 3 β -hydroxy-22 R ,25-epoxylansta-7,9 (11)-dien-15-one,
            with a trivial name of phellinol A. </p>

         <p> Compound 2 was obtained as white amorphous powder. Its molecular formula C 30 H 50 O 4
            was deduced from HRESIMS. Its NMR data ( Table 1 ) were similar to those of 1 ,
            suggesting a lanostane triterpenoid with a tetrahydrofuran ring. The major differences
            were that the 1 H NMR spectrum of 2 displayed the signals of two additional oxygenated
            methines at δ H 4.13 (q, J = 3.6 Hz, H-2) and 4.25 (dd, J = 9.8, 5.6 Hz, H-15), instead
            of two olefinic protons in 1 . The 1 H– 1 H COSY correlations from H-1 to H-3, and from
            H-15 to H-24, as well as the HMBC correlations of H 2 -1/C-2, H 2 -1/C-3, H-2/C-3,
            H-2/C-10, and H 3 -30/C-15 revealed the hydroxylations of C-2 and C-15. The position of
            a fully substituted double bond (Δ 8,9 ) was suggested by the HMBC correlations of H 2
            -7/C-8, H 2 -7/C-9, H 2 -11/C-8, H 3 -19/C-9, and H 3 -30/C-8. The small coupling
            constant (3.6 Hz) between H-2 and H-3 confirmed that they were cis -oriented ( ). The
            NOE correlations of H-2/H-3, H-2/H-5, H-3/H-5, and H-3/H 3 -28 revealed the α
            -orientations of H-2 and H-3. The obvious NOE correlation between H-15 and H 3 -18
            indicated that H-15 was β -oriented ( Fig. 4 ). The spectroscopic data of the C-20–C-27
            sidechain were in good agreement of those of 1 , which suggested that C-22 should be in
            R form. To provide more justification for this configuration, the acetylated product of
            2 ( 2a ), initially obtained by treating 2 with acetic anhydride, was further treated
            with BBr 3 to yield tetrahydrofuran ring-opening product 2b . The coupling constant of
            H-22 (dd, J = 9.6, 3.1 Hz) and the proton chemical shifts from H-21 to H- 27 in 2b were
            similar to those of inonotsuoxodiol A ( ) with the same side chain, supporting a R
            configuration at C-22. Based on the above evidence, the structure of 2 was assigned as
            22 R ,25-epoxylansta-8-en-2 β ,3 β ,15 α -triol and named phellinol B. </p>
         <p> Compound 3 possessed a molecular formula of C 30 H 48 O 4 as determined by the positive
            HRESIMS. The molecule weight of 3 was two mass units less than that of 2 , corresponding
            to a degree of unsaturation. Comparison of their spectroscopic data revealed that the
            isolated double bond (Δ 8 ) in 2 was replaced by a conjugated one (Δ 7,8 and Δ 9,11 ) in
            3 , as suggested by the chemical shifts of H-7 at δ H 5.86, d ( J = 6.6 Hz) and H-11 at
            δ H 5.33, d ( J = 4.5 Hz). The position of the conjugated double bond Δ 7,8 and Δ 9,11
            was further revealed by 1 H– 1 H COSY and HMBC correlations. The α -orientations of H-2
            and H-3, and the β -orientation of H-15 were confirmed by the pertinent NOE
            correlations. The identical spectroscopic data of the side chain between 2 and 3
            suggested that C-22 had an ( R )-configuration. Therefore, the structure of 3 was
            determined to be 22 R ,25-epoxylansta-7,9 (11)-dien-2 β ,3 β ,15 α -triol, and was given
            a trivial name phellinol C. </p>
         <p> Compound 4 was isolated as white amorphous powder. Its molecular formula was determined
            to be C 30 H 48 O 7 by the positive HRESIMS. The planar structure was elucidated on the
            basis of HSQC, COSY and HMBC spectra analysis ( Fig. 2 ). The ABCD-ring of 4 was similar
            to that of 2 except for the carbonylation of C-7 ( δ C 204.5) and hydroxylation of C-11
            [ δ H 4.60, dd ( J = 9.2, 4.5 Hz), H-11; δ C 63.8, C-11]. One significantly deshielded
            olefinic carbon ( δ C 166.9, C-9) suggested the conjugation of the double bond (Δ 8,9 )
            with a carbonyl group. The HMBC correlations from H 2 -6 ( δ H 2.80, 2.56) to C-4 ( δ C
            38.1), C-7 ( δ C 204.5), C-8 ( δ C 139.7), and C-10 ( δ C 40.5), and from H-11 to C-8
            and C-13 ( δ C 48.8) revealed the locations of additional carbonyl and hydroxyl groups
            at C-7 and C-11, respectively. The NOE correlation of H-11/H 3 -19 suggested a β
            -orientation of H-11 ( Fig. 4 ). The relative large coupling constant of H-20/H-22 ( J =
            9.2 Hz) and the similar 13 C NMR data of C-20–C-23 with those of inonotsuoxodiol A ( ),
            being different from those of astraeusins D-F ( ) with same side chain, indicated a R
            configuration on C-22. The double bond Δ 24,25 adopted an E -configuration as suggested
            by the NOE correlation between H 2 -24 ( δ H 5.56) and H 2 -26 ( δ H 3.97). On the basis
            of aforementioned data, phellinol D ( 4 ) was elucidated as 2 β ,3 β ,11 α ,15 α ,22 R
            ,26-hexahydroxylansta-8,24- dien-7-one. </p>
         <p> 9,11 </p>
         <p> Compound 5 was assigned a molecular formula of C 30 H 44 O 5 on the basis of HRESIMS.
            Comparison of the spectroscopic data of 5 and 4 revealed that their ABC-ring was varied.
            The HMBC correlations from olefinic proton ( δ H 6.58, s, H-1) to C-3 ( δ C 200.2), C-5
            ( δ C 46.6), and C-19 ( δ C 25.1), and from H 3 -29 ( δ H 1.16) to C-3 and C-5 indicated
            the presence of an α , β -unsaturated carbonyl group in A ring. The chemical shifts of
            C-1 ( δ C 123.7), C-2 ( δ C 143.3), and C-3 ( δ C 200.2) were similar with those of
            sublateriol A ( ), a C-2 hydroxylated α , β -unsaturated 3-keto lanostane triterpenoid.
            This information suggested that a hydroxyl group attached to C-2. The 1 H NMR signals at
            δ H 5.96 (H-7) and 5.58 (H-11), and the 13 C NMR signals at δ C 121.5 (C-7), 140.6
            (C-8), 141.2 (C-9), and 117.4 (C-11) were characterized for the presence of a conjugated
            double bond (Δ 7,8 and Δ). The α -orientation of the hydroxyl group at C-15 was revealed
            by the NOE correlation of H-15/H 3 -18. The absolute configuration of C-22 was deduced
            to be R based on the similar spectroscopic data with those of 4 . Accordingly, the
            structure of 5 was established as 2,15 α ,22 R ,26-tetrahydroxylansta-1,7,9
            (11),24-tetraen-3-one, with a trivial name of phellinol E. </p>
         <p> The molecular formula of compound 6 was deduced to be C 30 H 46 O 5 from the positive
            HRESIMS. The spectroscopic data assignable to the BCD-ring exhibited differences from
            those of 4 . The NMR spectra of 6 showed signals for a conjugated double bond (Δ 7,8 and
            Δ 9,11 ) at δ H 6.79 (H-7) and 5.40 (H-11), and a carbonyl group at δ C 218.0 (C-15).
            Further detailed COSY and HMBC correlations analysis revealed the planar structure of 6
            as shown in Fig. 1 . The orientations of H-2 and H-3 were determined by the same NOE
            correlations as those for compounds 2–4 . Consequently, phellinol F ( 6 ) was assigned
            as 2 β ,3 β ,22 R ,26-tetrahydroxylansta-7,9 (11),24-trien-15- one. </p>
         <p> Compound 7 was obtained as white amorphous powder. The molecular formula of 7 was
            determined to be C 33 H 52 O 9 by the positive HRESIMS. The spectroscopic data of
            ABCD-ring in 7 was similar to those of 1 except for the down-field shift of C-3 (Δ δ C 9
            ppm), possibly due to the glycosidation of C-3. The anomeric proton at δ H 4.15 (d, J =
            7.8 Hz, H-1 ′ ), indicative of a β -configuration for glycosidic bond, showed HMBC
            correlation with C-3 ( δ C 88.1) and NOE correlation with H-3 ( δ H 3.09), suggesting
            the attachment of a sugar moiety to C-3. Enzymatic hydrolysis of 7 yielded D-glucose, as
            revealed by HPLC analysis and comparison with corresponding derivatives of standard
            D/L-glucose. Detailed HSQC, COSY, and HMBC spectra analysis ( Fig. 2 ) revealed a
            25,26,27-trinorlanostanoid. The NOE correlations between H-3 ( δ H 3.09) and H-5 ( δ H
            1.03) indicated that H-3 was α -oriented ( Fig. 4 ). The absolute configuration of C-22
            was proposed to be R based on the biosynthetic consideration. On the basis of the
            above-mentioned data, the structure of 7 was elucidated as 3- O -β -D-glucopyranosyl-3 β
            ,22 R ,24- trihydroxy-25,26,27-trinorlanosta- 7,9 (11)-dien-15-one, and was given a
            trivial name phellinol G. </p>
         <p> To validate the absolute configuration of C- 22 in 7 , two 22-hydroxy-25,26,27-
            trinorlanostane triterpenoids epimerized at C-22 were synthesized from the commercial
            lanosterol ( 7a ). The lanosterol was initially acetylated. Then the double bond Δ 24,
            25 in 7b was epoxided by mCPBA, followed by oxidative cleavage with H 5 IO 6 . The
            yielded product 7d was dehydrogenated by selenium dioxide to afford an α , β
            -unsaturated aldehyde. Subsequently, reduction of 7e with NaBH 4 gave an allyl alcohol
            in the side chain of 7f , which was subjected to Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation and
            Red-Al reduction to yield 25,26,27-trinorlanosta-8-en-3 β ,22 S ,24-triol ( 7i ) and
            25,26,27-trinorlanosta-8-en-3 β ,22 R ,24-triol ( 7j ), respectively. In the end, the
            spectroscopic data of 7i and 7j showed no distinguishable difference, due to the
            substitution on C-23 was not bulky enough to form the predominant conformation (Fig.
            76S). To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time to stereoselectively
            hydroxylate C-22 for lanostane triterpenoids, through 22 R - and 22 S -
            hydroxylanostanoids were synthesized ( ; ). </p>
         <p> Compounds 1–10 were evaluated for their cardioprotective activity against
