L. (
<tp:taxon-name>Hypericaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) has been used as a folk Chinese medicine for the treatment of inflammatory related diseases. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a crucial target for the development of agents to treat inflammation. To search for anti-inflammatory compounds from traditional Chinese medicines, a chemical constituent study along with COX-2 inhibitory activity analysis was performed for this plant. In this study, sixteen chemical monomers, including three undescribed oxidative degradation polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs, hypemoins C–E), two undescribed PPAPs (hypemoins A and B), and 11 known compounds, were identified from the flowers of 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. monogynum
</tp:taxon-name>
. Their structures were characterized by HRESIMS, NMR techniques, ECD, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Four flavonoid derivatives showed remarkable COX-2 inhibitory activities, with IC 
50
values ranging from 0.220 ± 0.006 to 1.655 ± 0.098 μM. Among these compounds, the possible recognition mechanism between quercetin 3-(6 
′′
-O-caffeoyl)-β-3-D-galactoside and COX-2 was predicted by molecular docking analysis. Moreover, the multidrug resistance reversal activities for the selected compounds were evaluated.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
Hypericum monogynum
</tp:taxon-name>
L. (
<tp:taxon-name>Hypericaceae</tp:taxon-name>
), a shrub, mainly grows in lowland provinces of 
China
, such as 
Sichuan
, 
Anhui
, 
Fujian
, 
Guangdong
, 
Guangxi
, 
Guizhou
, 
Henan
, 
Hubei
, and 
Hunan
(

). 
This
plant has been prescribed as a folk 
Chinese
medicine for the treatment of hepatitis, conjunctivitis, acute laryngopharyngitis, and snake bites (Editorial committee of the administration bureau of traditional Chinese medicine, 1999). 
The
occurrence and development of the diseases described above are closely related to inflammation (

; 

; 

). 
Previous
phytochemical investigations of this species have revealed that it is rich in different 
types
of specialized metabolites including flavonoids, polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs), diterpenes, and xanthones (

; 

, 

, 

). Among these specialized metabolites, some xanthones and PPAPs have been shown to exhibit neuroprotective effects and multidrug resistance (MDR) reversal activities (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
The arachidonic acid cascade in the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway is one of the most important pathways in the inflammatory process, in which COX-2 is a significant target for the discovery of many undescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (

). To date, several drugs targeting COX-2 are on the market, such as nimesulide, meloxicam, and celecoxib. However, many drugs have numerous side effects. Consequently, searching for undescribed COX-2 inhibitors with little or no side effects is necessary.
</p>
         <p>
Thus, to explore the potential anti-inflammatory compounds from 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. monogynum
</tp:taxon-name>
, subsequent chromatographic fractionation of the MeOH extract of the flowers of 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. monogynum
</tp:taxon-name>
gave seven PPAPs (
1–7
), four flavonoids (
8–11
), and five phenolics (
12–16
). Among them, compounds 
1–5
are undescribed compounds with a unique tricyclic 
γ
-lactone moiety. All compounds were screened for their inhibitory effects on COX-2. Moreover, selected compounds were tested for multidrug resistance reversal activity. Herein, the isolation, structural elucidation, and bioactive study of these compounds are described.

2. Results and discussion
</title>
         <p>
Hypemoin A (
1
), a white amorphous powder, presented a molecular formular of C 
26
H 
36
O 
7
from the HR-ESI-MS ion at 
m
/ 
z
483.2346 [M + Na] 
+
(calcd. for C 
26
H 
36
O 
7
Na, 483.2353). The 1D NMR data (
Table 1
) were similar to those of biyoulactone B (
7
) (

). The planar structure for compound 
1
with units A and B was readily assigned from 2D NMR spectroscopy (
Fig. 2
). The difference between those two compounds was that a 2-methylbutanoyl group at C- 
5 in
7
was replaced by a 2-methylpropanoyl group (
δ
C
206.0, 37.9, 17.0, and 17.7) in 
1
. This deduction was confirmed by the HMBC correlations of both H 
3
-13 and H 
3
-14 to C-11 and C-12 together with the 
1
H– 
1
H COSY correlations of H 
3
-13/H-12/H 
3
-14 (
Fig. 2
). Other parts of 
1
were identical to those of 
7
by analysis of the 2D NMR spectroscopic data. The relative configuration of 
1
was partially deduced by a NOESY experiment (
Fig. 2
), in which cross-peaks of Me-27/H-19/H-22 
β
/Me-26 revealed that these groups were co-facial and were assigned as being in the β- orientation. In addition, NOESY correlations of 20-OH/H-23 revealed that these groups are α- oriented. Unfortunately, the relative configuration of 
1
could not be determined due to the lack of key NOESY correlations. Luckily, crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction could be obtained from ethanol. X-ray diffraction analysis, conducted with Cu Kα radiation, not only confirmed the complete structure but also assigned the absolute configurations of all asymmetric carbon centers (
Fig. 3
).
</p>
         <p>
Hypemoin B (
2
) had the same molecular formula as compound 
1
(C 
26
H 
36
O 
7
) by the HRESIMS ion at 
m
/ 
z
483.2347 [M +Na] 
+
(calcd. for C 
26
H 
36
O 
7
, 483.2353). Detailed analysis of the 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data (
Table 1
) indicated that compound 
2
had the same planar structure as compound 
1
. The chemical shift of C-23 was shifted significantly upfield from 
δ
C
47.4 in
1
to 
δ
C
44.3 in
2
, which implied that compound 
2
was a 23-epimer of compound 
1
. In the NOESY spectrum (
Fig. 4
), the correlations of 6-OH/H 
3
-7, 6-OH/H-18β, H-18 
β
/H-19, H-19/H-23, and H-23/ H 
3
-27 were readily observed, supporting the 
β
-configuration of H-23. Moreover, the calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) curve matched well with the experimental ECD curve (

), confirming the absolute configuration of 
2
(
Fig. 4
). Thus, the structure of 
2
was elucidated as shown (
Fig. 1
).
</p>
         <p>
Hypemoin C (
3
) was designated with the molecular formula C 
20
H 
30
O 
4
(six degrees of unsaturation), as determined by HR-ESI-MS data at 
m/z
357.2033 [M + Na] 
+
(calcd. for C 
20
H 
30
O 
4
Na, 357.2036). Detailed comparison of its 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data (
Table 2
) revealed that 
3
shared the same moiety of unit B as that of compound 
1
. This inference was confirmed by the multiple HMBC correlations as well as 
1
H– 
1
H COSY correlations, as shown in 
Fig. 5
. However, unit A was oxidized to a side chain of 2,5-dimethylhex-4-enoyl. The HMBC correlations (
Fig. 5
) from H 
2
-10 to C-13, from H 
3
-15 to C-13 and C-14, and from both H 
3
-19 and H 
3
-20 to C-16 and C-18, together with the 
1
H– 
1
H COSY correlations of H-14/H 
2
-16/H-17, supported the presence of this side chain (C-13‒C-20) connected at C-2. The NOESY cross-peaks of H-6α/OH-5, OH-5/H-8, H-8/H-3α, and H-8/H-10α implied the α- orientation of these groups. Moreover, the NOESY cross-peaks from Me-12 to H-6β and H-4 and from H-4 to H-3β led to the β- orientation assignment of these protons. In addition, the coupling constant for H-4 (td, 
J
= 12.6, 5.1 Hz) indicated the trans-junction of the octahydroindene ring system (

) (
Fig. 5
). Thus, the relative configuration of this rare octahydro-1H-1,4-methanocyclopenta [c]oxepine ring system was assigned. Subsequently, the relative configuration of the side chain (2, 5-dimethylhex-4-enoyl) was fixed. However, the relative configuration of the methyl group of C-15 could not be assigned due to the lack of a key NOESY correlation of this group located on the side chain as well as the rotation of this side chain. The structure of 
3
, as an undescribed oxidative degradation product of compounds 
1
and 
2
, was therefore elucidated and given the name hypemoin C (
3
).

Compounds

and

presented molecular formulas of C

deduced from their HR-ESI-MS ions at 
m/z
291.1201 [M + Na]

(calcd. for C 
14
H 
20
O 
5
Na, 291.1203) and 233.1145 [M + Na] 
+
(calcd. for C 
12
H 
18
O 
3
Na, 233.1148), respectively. Comparison of the 1D NMR data of 
4
and 
5
with those of hypemoin C (
3
) suggested that the substituted group at C-2 was further oxidized to an ester (
4
) or degraded to a hydrogen atom (
5
). Further observation revealed that the ester group was located at C- 
2 in
4
by the HMBC correlations of 14-OCH 
3
(
δ
H
3.69, s) to C-13 (
δ
C
170.0). For compound 
5
, the HSQC correlation from H-2 (
δ
H
2.73, td, 
J
= 4.9, 1.8 Hz) to C-2 (
δ
C
40.9) and the 
1
H– 
1
H COSY correlations of H-2/H 
2
-3 indicated that there was no substituent group at C-2. The same NOESY correlations and 1D NMR data between 
4
and 
3
assigned the same relative configurations (
Fig. 5
). The absolute configuration of 
4
(1 
S
, 4 
S
, 5 
R
, 8 
R
, 9 
S
) was determined by ECD calculation (
Fig. 6
) (

), which indicated that the experimental ECD results were consistent with the calculated ECD results. The well-matched experimental ECD spectra of 
5
and 
4
further confirmed the absolute configuration of 
5
(
Fig. 6
). Hence, the structures of 
4
and 
5
, as undescribed further oxidative degradation products of compound 
3
, were established as shown in 
Fig. 1
. To the best of our knowledge, compounds 
3–5
represent the first oxidative degradation PPAPs with an octahydro-1H-1,4-methanocyclopenta [c]oxepine ring system.

has been used as a folk Chinese medicine for the treatment of inflammatory related diseases, and COX-2 is a crucial target for the development of agents to treat inflammation. Therefore, we evaluated the in vitro anti-inflammatory properties of compounds 
1–16
. The results (
Table 3
) showed that flavonoids 
8–11
showed significant inhibitory activity, with IC 
50
values ranging from 0.220 ± 0.006 to 1.655 ± 0.098 μM (

). Among them, flavonoids with substituted sugars (
8
, 
10
, and 
11
) were the best COX-2 inhibitors, with IC 
50
values ranging from 0.220 ± 
0.006
–0.265
μM. PPAP derivatives (
1–7
) and phenolics (
12–16
) showed no activity (IC 
50
&gt;
20 μM).
</p>
         <p>
To investigate the molecular recognition mechanism between the most active compound and COX-2, compound 
8
was applied to in silico analysis with a human COX-2 protein model (PDB code: 5IKQ) (

; 

). As shown in 
Fig. 7
, the results demonstrate that hydrogen bonds exist between 
8
and residues in the hydrophobic channel, leading to the catalytic site of the protein. Specifically, five hydrogen bonds were observed to 
<tp:taxon-name>form between</tp:taxon-name>
a carbonyl group of C-4 and TRP-387, between 4 
′′
-OH and HIS-214, between 6 
′′′
-OH and GLN-289, and between 7 
′′′
-OH and ASC-222. Moreover, the structure of 
8
was packed into the hydrophobic pocket formed by GLN-203, LEU-291, TRP-387, and LYS-214, favoring binding. These interactions contribute to the localization of the inhibitor within the hydrophobic COX-2 channel (
Fig. 7
).
</p>
         <p>
Since many PPAP derivatives have been reported to possess moderate to significant MDR reversal activities (

; 

), compounds 
1–7
and 
9
(20 μM) along with adriamycin (ADR, 40 μM) were evaluated for their MDR reversal activity against MCF-7/ADR cells by the MTT method (
Table 4
). Then, the active compounds (
1
, 
2
, 
6

) were screened for their cytotoxicity against MCF-7/ADR cells, and no obvious cytotoxicity toward the tested cell lines was observed (IC 
50
&gt;
150 μM). The results showed that four PPAPs (
1
, 
2
, 
6
, and 
7
) showed moderate reversal activity against MCF-7/ADR cells at a concentration of 20 μM, with reverse folds (RFs) ranging from 11 to 27 (
Table 4
). When compounds 
1
and 
2
with a unit A fragment were oxidized to a side chain (
3
) or an ester (
4
) or degraded to a hydrogen atom (
5
), the activity disappeared.

3. Conclusion
</title>
         <p>
In this work, sixteen chemical monomers (
1–16
), including three undescribed oxidative degradation PPAPs (
3–5
), two undescribed PPAPs (
1
and 
2
), four flavonoids (
8–11
), and five phenolic compounds (
12–16
), were discovered from the flowers of 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. monogynum
</tp:taxon-name>
. All the compounds were evaluated for COX-2 inhibitory activity, and four flavonoids exhibited excellent activity. These results support the anti-inflammatory effect of flavonoids and illustrate the anti-inflammatory effect of this plant in traditional Chinese medicine. Furthermore, our findings greatly expand the structural diversity of biologically active PPAPs and flavonoids.

4.4. Theoretical ECD calculation
</title>
         <p>
Theoretical calculations of ECD spectra for compounds 
2
and 
4
were performed with the Gaussian 09 program package (

). The preliminary conformational distributions search was performed by HyperChem Release 8.0 software. Selected conformers with distributions higher than 1% were further optimized by the DFT (density functional theory) method at the B3LYP/6–311 +g (d) level in Gaussian 09 program package (

). The ECD of the conformer of selected conformers was then calculated by the TD-DFT method at the CAM-B3LYP/tzvp levels with the PCM model in methanol solution. The overall calculated ECD curves were weighted by Boltzmann distribution. The calculated ECD spectra were produced by SpecDis 1.604 (

). Detailed calculated parameters were proved in Supporting Information.
