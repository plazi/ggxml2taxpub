1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
In this paper we wish to report the isolation of six new conjugated 3- keto-steroids from the Australian brown alga 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cystophora xiphocarpa
(Harvey)
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Sargassaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Fucales</tp:taxon-name>
) and their cytotoxicity. This forms part of our ongoing studies of the specialised metabolites from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cystophora
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
(

; 

; 

; 

; 

, 

). Members of this genus produce a range of specialised metabolites including simple terpenoids, cyclised terpenoids, 
p
-toluquinol diterpenes, acyl-phoroglucinols and resorcinols and in the case of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. brownii
</tp:taxon-name>
a steroid oxidised at C-16 (

, and references cited therein). 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. xiphocarpa
</tp:taxon-name>
is of particular interest since it is the extant putative origin species of the genus (

).
</p>
         <p>
Bioactive α,β- conjugated 3-keto-steroids have been isolated from both terrestrial and marine organisms but remain relatively rare (
Fig. 1
). The 16-hydroxy sterones tumacone B (
1
) and tumacoside B (
2
) (
Fig. 1
) were isolated from the South American plant 
<tp:taxon-name>
Solanum nudum
(
Saez et al., 1998
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. While neither compound revealed bioactivity when tested, the
</p>
         <p>
C-16 acetate derivative tumacoside A (
3
) displayed 
in vitro
antimalarial activity against 
<tp:taxon-name>
Plasmodium falciparum
</tp:taxon-name>
chloroquine-resistant FCB-1 strain, with IC 
50
= 27 μM. In addition to hydroxylation at C-16, conjugated 3-keto-steroids with a hydroxy group at C-6 have been reported from the red algae 
<tp:taxon-name>
Jania adhaerens
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Red Sea (

). They included the previously undescribed compound 6β,16β- dihydroxycholest-4-en-3-one (
4
) and known compounds 6β- hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one (
5
), 6β- hydroxycholest-4,22-dien-3-one (
6
) as well as 16β- hydroxy-5α- cholestan-3,6-dione (
7
). Compound 
7
was found to be protective toward induced DNA damage of human peripheral blood cells (

). Biologically active 3-ketosteroids with hydroxy groups at C-20 and C- 
22 in
addition to a hydroxy group at C-16 have been found in guggul, the oleogum resin of plant 
<tp:taxon-name>
Commiphora wightii
(
El-Mekkawy et al., 2013
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. Guggulsterol I (
8
) showed weak α- glucosidase inhibitory effects (

). Bioactive guggulsterol III (
9
), previously found in the plant 
<tp:taxon-name>
Commiphora mukul
</tp:taxon-name>
, was isolated again from the marine gorgonian 
Leptogargia sarmentosa
, along with the previously undescribed compounds 16- 
epi
-guggulsterol III (cholest-4-en-16α,20ξ- diol-3-one, 
10
) and cholest-4-en-20ξ- ol-3,16-dione (
11
) (

). Keto-steroids with a hydroxy group at C-7, a previously undescribed compound 7α- hydroxy-4,24(28)-ergostadien-3-one (
12
) and known compound 7,20 

S

-dihydroxyergosta-4,24 (28)-dien-3-one (
13
) were isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Antrocaryon klaineanum
</tp:taxon-name>
, a plant from 
Cameroon
(

). Compound 
13
is reported to show potent inhibition of the 3D7 strain of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Plasmodium falciparum
</tp:taxon-name>
with an IC 
50
value 21.3 ± 0.2 μM.

2. Results and discussion
</title>
         <p>
Pure compounds from the crude acetone extract of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. xiphocarpa
</tp:taxon-name>
were obtained after a series of chromatographic steps which included, in order, vacuum chromatography with a stepped gradient elution (light petroleum, 
CH
2
Cl 
2
, EtOH, MeOH), centripetal planar chromatography (Chromatotron®, elution with mixtures of light petroleum–EtOAc) and semi-preparative 
HPLC
(isooctane– 
CH
2
Cl 
2
–MeOH) resulting in the isolation of six undescribed compounds 
14
, 
15
, 
17
, 
18, 21
and 
22
(

H

A downfield signal in the

spectrum at

carbon at 
δC
171.4 (qC, C-5) are the only remaining signals consistent with the chemical shift of an alkene and the IR spectrum indicates that the carbonyl signal is part of an α,β- unsaturated system, these signals must constitute the α,β- unsaturation and the third unit of unsaturation.

Carbon multiplicities were determined from DEPT-90 and -135 spectra.
</p>
         <p>
As there are no unaccounted for unsaturated carbon atoms visible in the 
NMR
data, the remaining four units of unsaturation have been attributed to the presence of four rings. Typical of angular methyl groups in fused ring systems, two methyl groups show strong HMBC correlations to four different carbons each, namely, 
H
3
-18 (δ 0.96, 
s
) to C-12 (δ 40.0), C-13 (δ 42.7), C-14 (δ 53.3) and C-17 (δ 57.1), and 
H
3
-19 (δ 1.18, 
s
) to C-1 (δ 35.7), C-5 (δ 171.4), C-10 (δ 38.6) and C-9 (δ 53.8). These correlations with the HMBC correlation observed between H-9 (δ 0.90) and C-11 (δ 20.8) tie together all but one of the carbon atoms 
14
, including the α,β- unsaturated ketone moiety (
Fig. 3
).
</p>
         <p>
The molecular formula of compound 
14
indicates the presence of three oxygen atoms in the structure, one of which has been attributed to the presence of the ketone group. As the IR spectrum indicates the presence of at least one hydroxy group and since there are only two 

sp 
3

carbon atoms bonded to oxygen visible in the 
13
C
NMR
spectrum, the third oxygen atom must be part of a second hydroxy group. At this stage it was evident that compound 
14
is a steroid and the literature was searched for steroids with similar structures. Comparison of 
NMR
data from compound 
14
to data from a steroid nucleus and a steroidal side chain reported in the literature showed good agreement (

; 

; 

) with the values obtained from compound 
14
for the steroidal nucleus (
ΔδC

14
; The greatest differences were found at C-17, C-21 and C-23 with Δδ 2.4–4 ppm, possibly due to the two isomers being hydroxy epimers at C-22. In addition, the

</p>
         <p>
The NOESY spectrum of 
16
was measured in benzene-d 
6
. The key NOE correlations observed are shown in 
Fig. 4
. The cyclic carbonate extends the fused ring system of the steroid limiting rotation around C-17–C-20 and C-20–C-22. The NOEs observed are consistent with the standard steroid configuration with H-9, H-14 and H-17 appearing to be on the α- face of 
16
and H-8, 
H
3
-18 and 
H
3
-19 on the β- face. H-16 has an NOE correlation with H-17, as well as one of the protons on C-15, indicating that it is on the α- face. The cyclic carbonate has therefore been formed from a β- hydroxy group at C- 
16 in
compound 
14
. The assignment is supported by the clear difference in splitting pattern for H-16 when the hydroxy group is β compared to α. All of the previously undescribed compounds reported here have a 
ddd
splitting pattern with two moderate and one smaller coupling constant (

c. 
J

= 8, 7, 4 Hz) compared to the C-16 α- epimer which has no coupling constants greater than 7 Hz and one between 0 and 2.5 Hz (

).

Where no entry has been made, the nature of the splitting pattern of the signal could not be discerned due to heavy overlapping from other signals in the

H-17 has a NOESY correlation to 
H
3
-21 while 
H
3
-18 is correlated to the proton on C-20, as would be expected. The key NOESY correlation occurs between the angular methyl group 
H
3
-18 and the proton on C-22, placing it on the β- face of the ring system with the original hydroxy group, now participating in the cyclic carbonate, nominally originally on the α- face. Assuming that the normal absolute configuration for steroids applies, this makes compound

-epimer has a dihedral angle of about 170 
◦
between H-20 and H-22 and thus a coupling constant of ~10 Hz, as predicted by the Karplus equation calculator Sweet 
J
(

). In the case of the 22 

S

-epimer, modelling revealed the presence of two major conformations, viz. different gauche conformations of H-20 and H-22, φ = 48 
◦
and 70 
◦
, in a ratio of 40:60, respectively. These correspond to a coupling constant 
3
J
H-20,22
= ~2 Hz, in line with 

J

= ~4 Hz (cf. ~10 Hz) measured for compound 
16
. Interestingly, if one considers the two NOESY correlations observed between both 
H
3
-18 and H-21 to H-22, no single conformation appears to be able to explain them both, however, the presence of the two almost equally probable conformations does.
</p>
         <p>
Since compounds 
14
and 
15
, epimeric at C-22, have such distinctive splitting patterns for H-22, the molecular modelling and coupling constant analysis used for the carbonate derivative 
16
was repeated for 
14
and 
15
to ascertain whether these patterns might be diagnostic for the particular C-22 epimer present. Each isomer appeared to have only one major conformation (
&gt;
96% conformational bias) with 
φH20,22
= 65 
◦
and 168 
◦
for compounds 
14
and 
15
, respectively, similar to those calculated for the equivalent cyclic carbonate derivatives. Since the dihedral angles from H-22 to the two protons on C-23 are always one 
gauche
and one 
anti
, regardless of which C-22 epimer is present, it appears that the third coupling constant, viz. 
3
J
H-20,22
, can be used to distinguish between them (

were very similar to those of compounds

with the significant differences appearing in the signals ascribed to steroid side chain (C-20 to C-29) (supplementary data

H

-23 (δ 1.75,

= 10.3 Hz) which included an oxymethine proton at δ 3.80 (
ddd
, 

J

= 10.3, 2.3, 2.3 Hz, H-22). HMBC spectroscopy showed that H-22 is correlated with C-24, a downfield quaternary carbon atom at δ 79.8, which was also correlated with a vinylic proton (δ 5.73, 
dd
, 

J

= 17.4, 11.9 Hz, H-28) which was part of a new terminal alkene accounting for the extra 
CH
2
equivalent found in the molecular formula. The additional oxygen atom is clearly incorporated as a quaternary alcohol at C-24. The vinylic proton H-28 is also correlated with the C-25– 
C
27 spin system at C-25 (δ 38.4, 
CH
) completing the structure of the steroidal side chain. Thus, the structure of compound 
17
, in comparison with 
14
, has a vinyl group and an additional hydroxy group substituted at C-24, replacing the

Na 481.3288), isomeric with compound 
17
. All spectra (IR, 
NMR
) were very similar to those of 
17
with the only differences in the 
NMR
spectra of 
18
being attributable to differences in the steroidal side chain (C-20 to C-29). COSY and HMBC spectroscopy indicated that both compounds had the same planar structure (supplementary data Table 
S
5; 
Fig. S3
). The major difference in 
13
C
NMR
chemical shifts appears at C-25 (Δδ 3.9) and since the splitting pattern for H-22 is practically identical, the remaining chiral centre at C- 
24 in
the side chain must be the point of difference. Compounds 
17
and 
18
are epimers at C-24.
</p>
         <p>
The configuration at C-24 was determined by consideration of the differences of chemical shifts of the protons surrounding C-24. Since the splitting pattern of H-22 is almost identical in both compounds, it can be inferred that the difference in chemical shift of H-22 (Δδ 0.20) will be due to differences in configuration and conformation occurring in the C-24–C-29 part of their structures. Molecular modelling of both epimers provides lowest energy conformations consistent with this inference. The lowest energy conformation of C-24 

R

epimer shows that H-22 lies within the shielding cone of the alkene (Δ 
28
) whereas in the lowest energy conformation of the corresponding 
C
–24 

S

epimer the alkene is in a conformation where it is unlikely to influence the chemical shift of H-22 (supplementary data 
Fig. S4
). Thus the signal for H-22 of the C-24 

R

epimer (δ 3.80), being in the alkene shielding cone, will be relatively upfield from the signal for H- 
22 in
the

An additional pair of epimers were also isolated and tentatively identified. Compounds 
19
and 
20
were isolated as a mixture. The 1D and 2D 
NMR
spectra of the mixture suggested that the compounds are closely related and that the tetracyclic nucleus of both steroids in the mixture is identical to those of the steroids isolated previously. Many of the signals for the two compounds could be distinguished from each other through correlations appearing in the 2D 
NMR
spectra and their 
1
H
NMR
integrals; They appear to be present in a 2:1 ratio. The two compounds possess an ethenyl group on the steroidal side chain, similar to that present in compounds 
17
and

NMR
spectroscopy, molecular mechanics calculations and derivatisation.

         <p>
While these compounds were undescribed, as a class of bioactive steroids they are relatively unremarkable, joining a relatively small group isolated from a range of plant and algal sources. These compounds share hydroxylation at C-16 with the only other steroid thus far reported from the

A related steroid completely unadorned by hydroxy groups (

<tp:taxon-name>
Turbinaria conoides
</tp:taxon-name>
has no significant activity against cancer cell lines, namely, HT-29, P-388, KB and A-549 (lung) (

), while its 6β- hydroxy derivative does show significant activity, e.g. ED 
50
2.9 μM against HT-29. From this, it appears that hydroxy group functionalisation of the steroid nucleus enhances bioactivity but their location and orientation may not be that important in these examples. The role of the hydroxy groups in enhancing cytotoxicity could be simply due to non-specific changes in steroid intermolecular non-bonding interactions.

California
, 
USA
, with circular preparative layer chromatography plates coated with Merck TLC grade 7749 silica gel Kieselgel 60, PF 
254
containing gypsum (1 or

4.3. Molecular modelling
</title>
         <p>
Molecular modelling was performed using Spartan ’04 (Wavefunction Inc., Irvine, CA, 
USA
). The initial structures were minimised by molecular mechanics (MMFF) and then the native Monte-Carlo search routine employed to find the 100 lowest energy conformers for each structure, again using MMFF to determine the energy of each conformer. The conformers within each group were arranged in increasing energy. In cases where the difference in relative energy between the lowest energy conformation and first significantly different conformation is of the order of 8–10 kJ/mol, it was assumed that the lowest energy conformation is largely responsible for producing the observed NOE correlations and 
1

NMR
coupling constants.

, 250 μL, 20% in toluene) was added dropwise over 1 min while stirring vigorously at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by TLC and after 3 h the emergence of two products was observed. Additional phosgene solution (250 μL) was added dropwise over 1 min and the reaction stirred over night. The products were purified by normal phase HPLC (EtOAc–2,2,4-trimethylpentane, gradient from 1:19 to 1:4 over 80 min) to yield compound 
16
and a major byproduct which appeared to be the carbonate dimer at C-16, as determined by HRESIMS ([M + Na]

4.6. Growth inhibition assay
</title>
         <p>
All cell lines were purchased from the American 
Type
Culture Collection. Cell culture and stock solutions were prepared as follows. A 20 mM stock solution in DMSO was prepared for each compound and stored at 20 
◦
C
. All cancer cell lines were cultured at 37 
◦
C
, under 5% CO 

2
in

air, and were maintained in Dulbecco’ s modified Eagle’ s medium (Trace Biosciences, 
Australia
) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM sodium bicarbonate penicillin (100 IU/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL), and glutamine (4 mM). Cells in logarithmic growth were transferred to 96-well plates. Cytotoxicity was determined by plating cells in duplicate in 100 μL of medium at a density of 2000–3000 cells/ well. On day 0 (24 h after plating), when the cells were in logarithmic growth, 100 μL of medium with or without the test agent was added to each well. After 72 h drug exposure growth inhibitory effects were evaluated using the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and absorbance was read at 
540 nm
. Initially, percentage growth inhibition was determined at a fixed drug concentration of 25 μM. A value of 100% is indicative of complete cell growth inhibition. Those compounds showing appreciable percentage growth inhibition underwent further analysis in order to calculate the concentration (μM) that induced 50% growth inhibition (GI 
50
) relative to untreated cells. To achieve this a dose-response curve was produced using eight drug concentrations in the range of 0.25–50 μM.
