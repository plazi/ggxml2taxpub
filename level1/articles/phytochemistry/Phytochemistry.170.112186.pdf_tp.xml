Chemical investigation of the traditional Chinese medicine, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Murraya kwangsiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, led to the isolation of 16 undescribed biscarbazole alkaloids, kwangsines A–M, two undescribed natural products, (+/−)-bispyrayafoline C, and 19 known monomeric analogues. (±)-Bispyrayafoline C and (±)-kwangsines A–C are four pairs of biscarbazole atropisomers, and they were separated by chiral HPLC to obtain the optically pure compounds. The structures of the undescribed compounds were elucidated on the basis of HRESIMS and NMR data analysis. Their absolute configurations were assigned via comparison of the specific rotation, ECD exciton coupling method, as well as comparison of experimental and calculated ECD data. A compound showed significant inhibition on NO production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells, and four compounds exhibited moderate cytotoxicities against HepG2 cells, with IC 
50
values less than 20 μM.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Murraya
</tp:taxon-name>
comprises approximately 14 species and two varieties, mainly distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions. There are nine species and one variety in 
China
(Editorial 

). Previous phytochemical investigations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Murraya
species
</tp:taxon-name>
indicated the presence of carbazole alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, etc. (

; Lv et al., 2015a; 

). Carbazole alkaloids from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Murraya
</tp:taxon-name>
plants were reported to possess novel structures and potent anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, analgesic, and antimicrobial activities (

; 

; 

).

            <tp:taxon-name>
Murraya kwangsiensis
(C.C. Huang) C.C. Huang (Rutaceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
is a shrub growing up to 
1–2m
high, distributed widely in 
Guangxi
and 
Yunnan
provinces of 
China
(Editorial 

). The leaves and stems of this plant have been used as a folk medicine for the treatment of cold, measles, bronchitis, keratitis, injuries, and fractures (

; 

). Previously, five carbazole alkaloids were obtained from the leaves and stems of this plant (

). As part of an ongoing search for bioactive natural products from the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Murraya
</tp:taxon-name>
plants (

; Lv et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2016; 

; 

), the 95% aqueous ethanol extract of the leaves and stems of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. kwangsiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
was investigated to afford 16 undescribed carbazole alkaloid dimers (
2a/2b −4a/4b
, 
5–14
), two undescribed natural products (
1a/1b
) (
Fig. 1
), and 19 known monomeric carbazole alkaloids (
15–33
). The bispyranocarbazole alkaloid atropisomers (
1a/1b −4a/4b
) were separated by chiral HPLC and their absolute configurations were determined by comparison of the specific rotation, the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) exciton coupling method, and comparison of experimental and calculated ECD data. Herein, we described the isolation and structural characterization of compounds 
1–33
, as well as their inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in BV-2 microglial cells and their cytotoxicities on HepG2 cells.

1
to be the same with that of a synthetic bispyranocarbazole, bispyrayafoline C (

Analysis of the structural characteristics of 
1
showed that there is a high steric hindrance at its central biaryl axis, indicating an axial chirality existed. However, its specific rotation approached zero and no Cotton effects were observed in its ECD spectrum, suggesting 
1
as an atropisomer mixture (

, 

; 

). Chiral HPLC resolution of 
1
afforded a pair of enantiomers, 
1a
and 
1b
, in a ratio of 1:1, and their opposite specific rotations (
1a
, −144; 
1b
, +144) and ECD curves supported their enantiomeric relationship (
Fig. 2
). The ECD spectrum of 
1a
exhibited sequential negative and positive Cotton effects at 252 and 
218 nm
, i.e., a negative couplet derived from the electronic transition of the two carbazole monomers as shown in 
Fig. 3
. Therefore, the absolute configuration of (−)-bispyrayafoline C (
1a
) was determined as 
R
a
(

; 

), and correspondingly, (+)-bispyrayafoline C (
1b
) was assigned as 
S
a
configuration. Furthermore, the ECD spectra of (
R

)- and (
S

)- 
1
were calculated using the TDDFT method at the B3LYP/6-311 + G(d) level to confirm the result of ECD exciton coupling (

During the chiral separation of 
1a
and 
1b
, we found that they could interchange in methanol solution at room temperature. After six days, pure compound 
1a
or 
1b
converted to a mixture of 
1a
and 
1b
in a ratio of 1:1 (
Fig. 4
), and the interconversion was accelerated at a higher temperature (40 °C, 
Fig. S2
, Supporting Information). Thus, the pure atropisomer could only be obtained below the room temperature.

(±)-Kwangsine A (

−2 (

N 
2
O 
5
via its 
13
C NMR and HRESIMS data (
m/z

−
). The UV spectrum showed typical pyranocarbazole absorptions at 
λ
max
222, 242, 296, and 
320 nm
(

). Analysis of the 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data (
Tables 1
and 
2
) indicated that 
2
is an unsymmetrical pyranocarbazole dimer, and its structure is similar to that of 
1
, except that the methyl at C-3′ in one unit was replaced by a formyl group [
δ
H
10.05 and 
δ
C
196.6], which was supported by the HMBC correlations from the formyl proton to C-2′ (
δ
C
160.0) and C-3′ (
δ
C
116.8). Therefore, the structure of kwangsine A (
2
) was established as shown. Similar to 
1
, 
2
was also a pair of atropisomers. The isolation of its individual conformers (
2a
and 
2b
) was accomplished by a chiral HPLC separation, and the pure enantiomers were obtained in a ratio of 1:1. Their configurations were determined as 
R
a
for 
2a
and 
S
a
for 
2b
by comparison of their ECD (Fig. S8, Supporting Information) and specific rotation data with those of 
1a
and 
1b
.

(±)-Kwangsine B (
3
) was obtained as a brown amorphous powder, [

25
D
−4 (
c
0.1, MeOH). Its molecular formula was assigned as C 
36
H 
34
N 
2
O 
4
from the 
13
C NMR and HRESIMS data (
m/z

, calcd for C 
36
H 
33
N 
2
O 
4
, 557.2440). Analysis of the NMR data of 
3
indicated that it is an unsymmetrical dimeric carbazole, consisting of a pyrayafoline C unit and an isomurrayafoline B analogue unit (

; 

). Compared with isomurrayafoline B, the C-7′ methoxy group (
δ
H
3.90, 3H, s) was replaced by a hydroxy group (
δ
H
7.99, 1H, s) in 
3
, which was deduced to be located at C-7′ from the HMBC correlations of the hydroxy proton with C-6′ (
δ
C
109.2), C-7′ (
δ
C
152.9), and C-8′ (
δ
C
110.0). The absence of H-1 and H-1′ signals indicated that these two units were linked through C-1−C-1′. The optical inactivity of 
3
indicated that it is also a pair of atropisomer mixture in a ratio of 1:1. After chiral separation and ECD and specific rotation determination, the absolute configurations of 
3a
and 
3b
were determined as 
R
a
and 
S
a
, respectively (Fig. S14, Supporting Information), by comparison of their ECD and specific rotation data with those of 
1a
and 
1b
.

(±)-Kwangsine C (
4
) was obtained as a brown amorphous powder, [
α
] 
25
D
−4 (
c
0.1, MeOH). Its molecular formula, C 
41
H 
40
N 
2
O 
4
, was deduced from the HRESIMS (
m/z
623.2902 [M − H] 
−
, calcd for C 
41
H 
39
N 
2
O 
4
, 623.2910) and 
13
C NMR spectroscopic data. The NMR data of 
4
indicated that it was also a dimeric carbazole consisting of a pyrayafoline C unit and a pyrayafoline D unit (

; 

), and these two units were linked through C-1−C-1′, the same linkage as that of 
1−3
. The lack of optical activity and Cotton effect indicated that 
4
is also a pair of atropisomers. Chiral HPLC separation of 
4
gave two enantiomers, 
4a
and 
4b
in a ratio of 1:1, which have opposite ECD curves and specific rotations (Fig. S20, Supporting Information). The absolute configurations of 
4a
and 
4b
were established as 
R
a
and 
S
a
, respectively, by comparison of their ECD and specific rotation data with those of 
1a
and 
1b
. The experimental ECD spectra of 
4a
/ 
4b
are almost similar to those of 
1a
/ 
1b
. In addition, the calculated ECD spectrum of 3‴ 
R
-(
R
a
)- 
4
is also similar to that of 3‴ 
S
- (
R
a
)- 
4
. These observations suggested that the configuration at C-3‴ does not contribute much to the ECD curves of compounds 
4a
and 
4b
, which leads to the inability to determine the configuration at C-3‴.

Kwangsine D (
5
) was obtained as a brown amorphous powder. Its molecular formula was determined as C 
32
H 
28
N 
2
O 
3
by the HRESIMS (
m/ z
487.2024 [M − H] 
−
, calcd for C 
32
H 
27
N 
2
O 
3
, 487.2022) and 
13
C NMR spectroscopic data. The NMR data (
Tables 1
and 
2
) indicated 
5
as a dimeric carbazole alkaloid consisting of a pyrayafoline C and a murrayafoline A units (

). Comparison of the 
1
H NMR data of 
5
with those of murrayafoline A, the methyl group at 
δ
H
2.53 (3H, s) in murrayafoline A was replaced by a methylene group at 
δ
H
5.62 (2H, s) in 
5
. The two units were deduced to be linked via an 
N
–C-3′-methyl linkage from the HMBC correlations of the methylene protons with C-8a (
δ
C
137.9), C-9a (
δ
C
142.2), C-2′ (
δ
C
103.9), C-3′ (
δ
C
129.9), and C-4′ (
δ
C
110.0) (
Fig. 6
). Therefore, the structure of kwangsine D (
5
) was elucidated as shown.
</p>
         <p>
Kwangsine E (
6
) was obtained as a brown amorphous powder. Its molecular formula was assigned as C 
31
H 
26
N 
2
O 
2
on the basis of the 
13
C NMR and negative-ion HRESIMS data [
m/z
457.1910 [M − H] 
−
(calcd for C 
31
H 
25
N 
2
O 
2
, 457.1916)]. Its 1D and 2D NMR data were similar to those of 
5
, except for the absence of a methoxy singlet, and the replacement of an aromatic singlet in 
5
by two aromatic signals in 
6
[
δ
H
7.30 (1H, d, 
J
= 8.3 Hz, H-1′) and 7.17 (1H, overlapped, H-2′)]. Further 2D NMR analysis suggested that 
6
was a demethoxy derivative of compound 
5
, thus, the structure of kwangsine E (
6
) was defined as shown.
</p>
         <p>
Kwangsine F (
7
) was obtained as a brown amorphous powder, [
α
] 
25
D
‒7 (
c
0.1, MeOH). Its negative-ion HRESIMS data showed a deprotonated molecular ion at 
m/z
525.2560 [M − H] 
−
(calcd for C 
36
H 
33
N 
2
O 
2
, 525.2542), which in conjunction with the 
13
C NMR data assigned 
7
a molecular formula of C 
36
H 
34
N 
2
O 
2
. Interpretation of the NMR data revealed that the structure of 
7
was similar to that of 
6
, except for the presence of an additional prenyl unit in 
7
as evidenced by the resonances at 
δ
H
1.70 (2H, m, H-5″), 2.08 (2H, m, H-6″), 5.05 (1H, t, 
J
=7.7Hz, H-7″), 1.53 (3H, s, H-9″), and 1.62 (3H, s, H-10″). The HMBC correlations of H-5′′ (
δ
H
1.70) with C-7′′ (
δ
C
124.3), and H-4′′ (
δ
H
1.38) with C-2′′ (
δ
C
129.3), C-3′′ (
δ
C
77.1), and C-5′′ (
δ
C
40.2) suggested that the prenyl unit is linked at C-5′′. The absolute configuration of 
7
was assigned as (3″ 
S
) from its similar ECD curve and optical rotation sign with those of 
17
(
Fig. 5
; 
7
, [
α
] 
25
D
−7; 
17
, [
α

−16), one of the biosynthetic precursor units of 
7
. Therefore, the structure of kwangsine F (
7
) was deduced as shown.

O 
3
. Analysis of NMR data of 
8
(
Tables 1
and 
2
) showed a close structural resemblance to 
5
. The main difference between these two compounds was that the linkage pattern between the two carbazole units changed from the 
N
–C-3′-methyl linkage in 
5
to the C-1−C-3′-methyl linkage in 
8
, which was supported by the HMBC correlations of the methylene protons at 
δ
H
4.46 (2H, s) with C-1 (
δ
C

9
resembled those of

8
by two aromatic signals in

The molecular formula of 
10
was determined as C

based on the

C NMR and negative-ion HRESIMS data (

10
with those of 
8
revealed their structural similarity, and the only difference is the presence of an additional prenyl group in 
10
. In combination with the relevant HMBC correlation analysis, the prenyl group was deduced to be attached at C-5′′. A (3″ 
S

10
was deduced from its similar ECD curves (

11
to be an unsymmetrical carbazole dimer consisting of two pyrayafoline C units (

; 

). These two units were linked via a C-1−C-3′-methyl pattern deduced from the HMBC correlations of the 
CH

1
H and

owing to the same constituent units, pyrayafoline C and murrayafoline A moieties (

). However, the linkage pattern of the two units changed from 
N
–C-3′-methyl linkage in 
5
to C-6−C-3′-methyl linkage in

7.38 (1H, d,

The relative configurations of compounds 
1a
, 
1b
, and 
17
were submitted to random conformational analysis with the MMFF94s force field using the Sybyl-X 2.0 software package. The geometries of compounds 
1a
, 
1b
, and 
17
were calculated using the TDDFT method at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, and the frequencies were calculated at the same theoretical level. The stable conformers of 
1a
, 
1b
, and 
17
without imaginary frequencies were subjected to ECD calculation by the TDDFT method at the B3LYP/6-31 + G(d) level, with the CPCM model in MeOH. The ECD spectra of different conformers were simulated using SpecDis v1.51 with a half-band width of 0.3 ev, and the final ECD spectra were obtained according to the Boltzmann-calculated contribution of each conformer. The calculated ECD spectra were compared with the experimental data. All calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 program package.
