Psiadia arguta
(Asteraceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
is endemic to the island of 
Mauritius
in the Indian Ocean. The species is traditionally used to treat various ailments, such as its use as an expectorant or for the treatment of bronchitis and asthma. Preliminary biological screenings have displayed the antimalarial (
<tp:taxon-name>
Plasmodium falciparum
</tp:taxon-name>
) and anticancer (HeLa human cell line) potential of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
leaves. The phytochemical investigation of this plant has led to the isolation and characterization of sixteen compounds including five antiplasmodial molecules. The accumulation of the antiplasmodial compounds during the growth of the plant was studied by a 
1
H NMR-based metabolomic approach. In order to identify factors influencing the production of bioactive compounds, young plants of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
were multiplied using 
in vitro
culture techniques, and micro-propagated plants at different stages of development were acclimatized and followed for the experiments. The multivariate data analysis showed an accumulation of four bioactive compounds in the leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
when these plants were challenged with a biotic stress: labdan-13(
E
)-en-8α-ol-15-yl acetate, labdan-8α-ol-15-yl acetate, labdan-13(
E
)-ene-8α-ol-15-diol, and (8

            <tp:taxon-name>
Psiadia arguta
Pers. (Voigt) (Asteraceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
commonly known as “Baume de l'île Plate” belongs to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Asteraceae</tp:taxon-name>
family. This shrub is endemic to 
Mauritius
and is used in folk medicine as an expectorant and for treatment of bronchitis and asthma (

; 

). Its presence has been reduced due to urbanisation, propagation of invasive plants, and difficulties of seed germination (

). Some wild specimens can still be found on Ilot Gabriel, a small islet off the north coast of 
Mauritius
. However, this species is completely extinct in the natural habitat on 
Mauritius
. For this reason, 

P. 
<tp:taxon-name>arguta</tp:taxon-name>

has been registered in 
1997 in
the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. For its conservation, 

provided a micropropagation method through cotyledonary axillary bud culture and conservation efforts have led to the exclusion of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
from the IUCN Red List. Recent research on wild specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
have demonstrated the antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antiplasmodial, and anticancer potential of this species (

, 

; 

; 

). 

, 

) reported that 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
crude extracts have displayed a high antiplasmodial activity in comparison to the other biological activity tested (anti-inflammatory and anticancer). Indeed, the dichloromethane leaf extract displayed a strong activity against 
<tp:taxon-name>
Plasmodium falciparum
</tp:taxon-name>
3D7 and W2 strains with IC 
50
of 10.1 and 8.4 μg/mL, respectively. Besides, this extract exhibited a moderate antiplasmodial activity 
in vivo
in mice infested by

led to the isolation and characterization of 16 terpenoids including the known compounds β-amyrin, α-amyrin, labda-13(

). Further studies on 
<tp:taxon-name>

are difficult due to its low abundance and the degree of protection in natural parks (

; 

). Vegetative micropropagation represents an efficient tool for the sustainable production of this species for scientific experiments. Thus, in our continuing research on 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
, we conducted a greenhouse experiment in order to understand the conditions for accumulation of the antiplasmodial compounds. To achieve these objectives, 
in vitro
plantlets were micro-propagated and then acclimatized. Three parameters have been taken into account in order to identify the conditions of accumulation of the antiplasmodial compounds: the age of plants, the conditions of culture and the effect of the environment. Besides, metabolomics has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to analyse the metabolic profile of biological samples (

). Therefore, in the present study, a 
1
H NMR based metabolomic analysis was performed to determine the differences between plants according to each studied factor and rapidly recognize the metabolites involved in the antiplasmodial activity of

            <tp:taxon-name>

is endangered due to its low abundance and difficulties for seed germination both in its natural habitat and in artificial conditions (

). In the present study, given that 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
seed germination is difficult, it was impossible to obtain sufficient quantities of plant material for all experiments. Thus, young plants were micro-propagated using tissue culture techniques as previously reported (

). In order to investigate the circumstances for accumulation of the antiplasmodial compounds, plants of 6, 7, 8, and 9 months old were studied. Besides, two conditions of culture were studied: 
in vitro
and acclimatized plants. Three independent repetitions were performed for the acclimatization of plants as these could be subjected to various stresses during this process. Indeed, some acclimatized plants were attacked by mealybugs and aphids. In natural habitat, insects were observed on the leaf surfaces of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
young plants on Ilot Gabriel (islet off the north coast of 
Mauritius
) and in the botanical garden of the University of 
La Reunion Island
(Kodja, comm pers). By removing the phloem sieve elements in the leaves, aphids introduce toxins, viruses, and other pathogens into the plant. Moreover, the honeydew secreted by the aphids is an ideal culture medium for various fungi on the leaf. Hence, in order to study the possible influence of the environment on the accumulation of antiplasmodial compounds, an elicitation step was performed on the acclimatized plants using 
<tp:taxon-name>
Botrytis cinerea
</tp:taxon-name>
culture filtrate. The protocol for obtaining all plants from different conditions of culture is summarized in 
Fig. 1
. The antiplasmodial activity of all crude extracts was evaluated, the chemical profile was analysed by 
1
H NMR, and a multivariate data analysis was performed to identify active compounds.

</title>
         <p>
The influence of the antiplasmodial activity according to the age of the plants was first analysed for axenic plants as these were produced in controlled and axenic conditions (
Table 1
). The results showed a weak antiplasmodial activity (IC 
50
of 31.3–41.7 μg/mL). The comparison of the antiplasmodial activity using parametric analysis of variance showed no significant values relating to the age of plants (Pvalue = 0.548). Therefore, this factor does not have a significant influence on the antiplasmodial activity of

plants that are up to 8 months old.

2.1.2. The effect of the conditions of culture on the antiplasmodial activity
</title>
         <p>
As only plants obtained from the first repetition and up to 8 months old were not attacked, the effect of the conditions of culture was analysed by comparison of the results obtained from leaf crude extracts of axenic and healthy acclimatized plants. At this stage, the plants transferred in the opened greenhouse were no longer in sterile conditions. The air and the TKS substrate contained microorganisms that might have influenced the plants’ metabolism. For both conditions of culture, the crude extracts displayed low antiplasmodial activity, with IC 
50
of 31.3–41.7 μg/mL for axenic plants and 28.9–39.7 μg/mL for healthy acclimatized plants (
Table 1
). The results showed no significant difference in the antiplasmodial activity for both conditions (Student t-test, P-value = 0.374). Therefore, the conditions of culture used in this study appeared to have no significant effect on the antiplasmodial activity of plants up to 8 months of age.

The effect of the environment on the antiplasmodial activity of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Psiadia arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
plants was studied by the comparison of healthy and attacked acclimatized plants. Insects were observed on some plants transferred in the opened greenhouse (
Fig. 2
). Plant damage from these insects on 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
consisted of yellowing leaves, dark spots of necrosis, and leaf wilt (
Fig. 2B
). The identification of these insects was attempted, and the results showed two different specimens: mealybugs from the 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudococcidae</tp:taxon-name>
family (voucher number: AFRA00185_01) and aphids from the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aphis
</tp:taxon-name>
genera (voucher number: AFRA00184_01) (
Fig. 2C and D
). These voucher specimens are registered in the reference collection of the UMR PVBMT (Unité Mixte de Recherche Peuplement Végétaux et Bio-agresseurs en Milieu Tropical, CIRAD of 
La Réunion
). The analysis of the antiplasmodial activity of the crude extracts obtained from the infected plants revealed that these plants exhibited a higher antiplasmodial activity, with IC 
50
of 16.1–32.1 μg/mL (Student t-test, P-value = 7.52 × 10 
−7
), in comparison to the crude extracts of healthy acclimatized plants (
Table 1
). Those results could be explained by the observation of aphids and mealybugs on the plants. The population growth of these insects increases rapidly during warm conditions (

), which was the case when the greenhouse experiments were performed. Aphids and mealybugs are plant damaging pests that consume large amounts of phloem sieve elements (

). Besides, the variation of the antiplasmodial activity for infected plants could be explained by the intensity of the attack. As reported on sorghum species, plant damage from aphids results from the loss of nutrients and sugars during feeding, which can cause plant water stress and a metabolic imbalance (

). Besides, symptoms of aphid damage include the purpling and twisting of the young leaves, and as feeding injury intensifies, leaf health declines and leaf colour changes to yellow or brown. These kinds of symptoms were observed on the leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P
.

</tp:taxon-name>
contaminated plants (
Fig. 2A and B
). In order to overcome biotic stresses, plants have evolved complex defence systems including the synthesis of diverse specialised metabolites, named phytoalexins (

). Those includes alkaloids, terpenoids, and phenolic compounds that affect the performance of herbivores (

). Thus, our results suggested that the physical and biotic stresses induced by the attack of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
plants by insects activated a defence reaction, which resulted in the accumulation of bioactive compounds in the leaves.

2.1.4. The effect of elicitation on the antiplasmodial activity

         <p>
In order to confirm the results obtained and evaluate the effect of a biotic stress on the metabolome of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
plants, we decided to focus on elicited plants of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
in controlled conditions. A preparation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Botrytis cinerea
</tp:taxon-name>
extract was chosen because this fungus is the prevalent one that damages plants. In response, plants have developed the ability to recognize the elicitors and to react to them by activation of defence responses. Besides, this elicitor has been successfully used in other species such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Vitis
spp
</tp:taxon-name>
to induce protection against major pathogens (

; 

). Therefore, in the present study, plants of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
were acclimatized in a greenhouse and were then elicited with a solution of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Botrytis cinerea
</tp:taxon-name>
culture filtrate. The latter contains β-glucan oligosaccharides (including 50% of DP6, 32% of DP5, and 18% of DP2-3) (

). Oligosaccharide fragments have previously been reported to induce resistance reactions in plants (

). Thus, two concentrations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. cinerea
</tp:taxon-name>
culture filtrate (8 and 
5 g

The results showed that all elicited plants were active in comparison to the control, which was inactive (IC

Besides, the time of incubation affected the antiplasmodial activity (analysis of variance, P-value = 0.0062); whereas, no significant difference was perceived for both tested concentrations (analysis of variance, Pvalue = 0.3645). There was no interaction between the two factors (analysis of variance, P-value = 0.5246). The antiplasmodial activity evaluated for the elicited plants is slightly higher than those measured for plants attacked by aphids and mealybugs, suggesting that

plants reacts rapidly to a biotic stress.

H NMR profiles and multivariate data analysis

</title>
         <p>
The chemical profile of all crude extracts was analysed by 
1
H NMR and a multivariate data analysis was performed in order to identify the bioactive metabolites. An unsupervised Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied on 
1
H NMR spectral data of all extracts to visualize variations between the samples (
Fig. S1
, supporting information). A three-component model explained 82.7% of the variance, with the first two components explaining 70%. From a general point of view, we noticed a trend of samples as grouping in two clusters along the first component: healthy samples (axenic and acclimatized ones) and attacked samples. In order to confirm these two groups discrimination, the orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was applied on the 
1
H NMR spectral data of healthy and attacked samples. The OPLS-DA model set of 1 predictive and 2 orthogonal components (RX 
2
= 66.3%, RY 
2
= 95.5% and Q 
2
= 83.2) (
Fig. 3A
). The permutation test confirmed the validity of the model (
Fig. 3B
). The receiver operating characteristic (
ROC
) curves showed areas under curve (AUC) of 1 (
Fig. 3C
). The comparison of spectral variables from both groups and the S-plot (
Fig. 3D
) has led to the identification of the variables contributing to this discrimination. Indeed, the contribution plot (
Fig. 3E
) highlighted the variables 0.80, 0.88, 0.92, 1.16, 1.40, 1.44, 1.48, 1.71, 2.12 and 4.12 that are found in the 
1
H NMR spectra of infected samples (AA). These specific signals in the region from 0.5 to 2.5 ppm were present at higher concentration in attacked samples (AA) but also at a lower intensity or completely absent in axenic plants (VH) and healthy acclimatized plants (AH) as observed in the 
1
H NMR spectra (
Fig. 4
). The scattering of attacked samples on the OPLS-DA score plot may be associated with the intensity of the attack and hence the variation of levels of specific metabolites in their crude extracts. These signals might be related to the higher antiplasmodial activity observed for attacked plants. As they were perceived in the aliphatic region of the NMR spectrum, they might be attributed to terpenes. Indeed, the existence of terpenoids can be determined by the presence of several singlets between 0.5 and 2.0 ppm in the 
1
H NMR spectrum, as observed on 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
attacked plants spectra (

). Besides, terpenes are a class of phytoalexins known to display a wide range of biological activity including an antiparasitic effect (

2.3. Identification of bioactive compounds
</title>
         <p>
The analysis of the 
1
H NMR spectra of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
extracts from all conditions of culture highlighted two distinct chemical profiles: the first one is related to healthy samples and the second one to attacked samples. The differences observed were mainly qualitative. The comparison of spectral data realised with the contribution plot revealed that these two groups were distinguished mainly by chemical variables at 
δH
0.76, 0.84, 0.92, 1.12, 1.16, 1.44, 1.64, 2.08, 3.73, and 4.13 ppm (
Figs. 3
and 
4
). Since all observed signals in attacked samples might be related to the terpenoids family, the 
1
H NMR signals were assigned by comparison to those of terpenes previously isolated (labdane diterpenes and triterpenes) from the wild specimen extract (

). The results provided evidence of labdan-13(
E
)-en-8α-ol-15-yl acetate (
1
), labdan-8α-ol-15-yl acetate (
2
), labdan-13(
E
)-ene-8α-ol-15-diol (
3
) and (8 
R
,13 
S
)-labdan-8,15-diol (
4
) in the extracts of contaminated plants (
Fig. 4
). Major signals such as H-19/H-20 at 
δH
0.76 (s), H-18 at 
δH
0.84 (s), and H-17 at 
δH
1.16 (s), characteristic of the labdane bicyclic ring, were clearly distinguished in the 
1
H NMR spectra. In addition to these, signals of the lateral chain of labdan-13(
E
)-en-8α-ol-15-yle acetate were detected at 
δH
2.12 (s) and 
δH
1.71 (s). Resonances at 
δH
2.12 (s) and 
δH
0.92 (d, 
J
= 6.6 Hz) were assigned to the labdan-8α-ol-15-yl acetate. Moreover, characteristic signals of the labdan-13(
E
)-ene-8α-ol-15-diol at 
δH
4.13 (q, 
J
= 6.7 Hz) and 
δH
1.71 (s), and the (8 
R
,13 
S
)-labdan-8,15-diol at 
δH
0.92 (d, 
J
= 6.6 Hz) and 
δH
3.69 (m) were also identified. In order to confirm those hypotheses, the 1D and 2D NMR spectra of one attacked plant crude extract were obtained (supporting information). The NMR data showed signals characteristic of the labdan bicyclic ring (
Table S1
, supporting information). Characteristic signals of the lateral chain provided evidence of compounds 
1–4 in
the crude extract of attacked plants. Indeed, the analysis of the 
13
C and 
1
H NMR spectra revealed resonances consistent with those of an acetate moiety (
δC
171.4 for C-1′, 
δC
20.3 for C-2′ and 
δH
2.0 for H-2′). In addition, the signals 
δC
137.4 and 
δC
30.6 associated with C-13 confirmed the presence of compounds 1 and 2, respectively. Furthermore, the HSQC cross-peaks between C-15 (
δC
58.3) and H-15 (
δH
3.6) and C-15 (
δC
63.0) and H-15 (
δH
4.1) are assigned to compounds 3 and 4.

         <p>
As demonstrated in our previous study on the isolation of antiplasmodial compounds from a wild specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
, the compounds 1–4 (
Fig. 5
) were the most active ones with IC 
50
of 10.2, 11.7, 11.3, and 6.9 μg/mL, respectively (

). Therefore, their accumulation in the contaminated plant extracts could explain their highest antiplasmodial activity compared to those of uninfected ones.

2.4. Elicitation
</title>
         <p>
In order to confirm the accumulation of these compounds in stressed plants, the 
1
H NMR spectra of all elicited plants were analysed. The inspection of all 
1
H NMR spectra revealed the presence of the same signals as those found in attacked plants’ spectra (
Fig. 4
). The results confirmed the production of these four compounds following a biotic or a physical stress.
</p>
         <p>
The identification of these four diterpenes in elicited plants as well as in acclimatized plants confirmed that they were synthetized in response to a biotic stress and without any specificity. Thus, those results demonstrated that labdan-13(
E
)-en-8α-ol-15-yl acetate, labdan-8α-ol-15-yl acetate, labdan-13(
E
)-ene-8α-ol-15-diol and (8

,13 
S
)-labdan-8,15-diol are accumulated in the leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
</tp:taxon-name>
plants after the first interaction with the environment, particularly after phytopathogenic attacks. Indeed, terpenes are phytoalexins that are biosynthesized in response to plant aggression (

). Many studies have demonstrated the induction of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes or diterpenes after fungal or herbivore attacks including aphid attacks (

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

). The induction of plant volatile biosynthesis is regulated by the jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) pathways, which are plant defence signalling pathways (

; 

). It is also established that the JA-signalling pathway regulates the biosynthesis of volatile terpenoids (

). Moreover, phloem-feeding insects such as aphids or mealybugs mainly trigger the SA- and JA-signalling pathways, which could explain our results on the accumulation of terpenes in the leaves of attacked plants (

). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of these four compounds produced by plants in response to attack by herbivorous insects.

In this work we have been able to establish the acclimatization of 

<tp:taxon-name>P. arguta</tp:taxon-name>

plantlets providing a biotechnological tool for the production of this plant and its metabolites. Besides, the NMR-based metabolomic approach used in the present study was a powerful tool to determine the metabolomic variation of plants in response to environmental perturbations. With this methodology, labdan-13(
E
)-en-8α-ol-15-yl acetate, labdan-8α-ol-15-yl acetate, labdan-13(
E
)-ene-8α-ol-15- diol, and (8 
R
,13 
S
)-labdan-8,15-diol were identified as the major compounds contributing to the discrimination between attacked and healthy plants. These four compounds were considered to be biotic stress-related chemicals that were also responsible for the antiplasmodial activity of attacked plants.

         <p>
The axenic plants of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arguta
Pers. (Voigt) (Asteraceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
were obtained from seeds that were collected in 2008 from a specimen in culture in the botanical garden of the University of 
Reunion Island
. The micropropagation of the axenic plants was performed using the method of 

.
</p>
         <p>
These axenic plantlets were cultured in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks on basal medium (BM). The BM consisted of macro and microsalts of (

) supplemented with 
30 g
/L sucrose, Maurel's vitamines (

) and 0.75% agar. The medium's pH was adjusted to 5.8, and then it was autoclaved at 121 °C. Every 3 months, well-developed plantlets containing multiple axillary buds were used for vegetative micropropagation on basal medium. Thus, the multiplication of axenic plantlets was performed by excision of axillary buds with few leaves (each consisting of a microshoot). All microshoots were placed on the surface of the basal medium.
</p>
         <p>
In the present work, three months old well-developed axenic plantlets were used to obtain plant materials for all experiments. Thus, three protocol experiments were followed to obtain 6-9 months-old plants depending on the conditions of culture: (1) 
in vitro
axenic plants, (2) plants acclimatized in a greenhouse, and (3) acclimatized and elicited plants in a greenhouse. The protocols are explained in 
Fig. 1
.
</p>
         <p>
(1) For the axenic plants, three months old well-developed plants were transplanted in 1 L glass bottles containing 500 mL of basal medium. These were allowed to grow for 3, 4, 5 or 6 months on this growth medium until they reached 6–9 months old. All axenic plants were kept in a growth room at 25 ± 1 °C and under a 14 h photoperiod provided by 400 Wm 
-2
cool fluorescent tubes. There was 1 biological replicate for each age of plant. When the plants were 6–9 months old, the leaves were collected and freeze-dried.
</p>
         <p>
(2) For acclimatized plants, excess culture medium was removed from the roots of three months old well-developed plants, and the plantlets were then transplanted into Magenta™ containers with sterile TKS 
®
1 substrate (growing medium, Floragard). After one month, all Magenta™ containers were opened in sterile conditions and transferred in a mini greenhouse. All plants were kept in this greenhouse and the level of humidity was reduced gradually within for 4 weeks (acclimatization step). All the plants were at that point five-months-old. Acclimatized plants were afterwards transplanted in pots (10 × 
10 cm
) containing non-sterile TKS 
®
1 substrate. All the plants were transferred in an opened greenhouse; located in the botanical garden of the University of 
Reunion Island
. The plants were allowed to grow 1–4 months on the non-sterile TKS substrate until they reached 6–9 months old. There were 4–5 biological replicates for each age of plants. For each age, the leaves of all specimens were collected and pooled together before freeze-drying.
</p>
         <p>
(3) For elicited plants, after the acclimatization step, the plants were transferred in the greenhouse and were allowed to grow for 2 months until they reached seven-months-old. Then, the plants were elicited with

Botrytis cinerea
</tp:taxon-name>
culture filtrate, which was provided by the Institut des Sciences de la Vigne et du Vin (Villenave d'Ornon,

8 g

5 g
/L of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. cinerea

culture filtrate were prepared in sterile water. Plants leaves were sprayed with these solutions, and 48 h or 72 h after treatment, the leaves were collected and freeze-dried.

4.2. Extraction
</title>
         <p>
Five grams of freeze-dried leaves of each sample were ground and exhaustively extracted by maceration with ethyl acetate (analytical grade, Carlo Erba) at room temperature with magnetic agitation. The extraction was repeated three times. The extracts were pooled and evaporated under reduced pressure and kept at 4 °C until analysis. The amount of crude extract obtained varied from 
0.3 to 0.5 g
.

For each sample, 15 ±

3
, D 99.9 atom %, Eurisotop) containing 0.03% TMS (tetramethylsilane) was added to each sample. The mixture was vortexed at room temperature for 1 min. An aliquot of 0.6 mL was transferred into 5 mm-NMR tubes for NMR analysis.

H NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker 600 MHz Avance III spectrometer (600.13 MHz proton NMR frequency) equipped with a 
TCI
cryoprobe. Each NMR spectrum was recorded in CDCl 
3
and consisted of 64 scans. CDCl 
3
was used as the internal lock. Each 
1
H-NMR spectrum was recorded with the following parameters: standard one-pulse sequence with 30° flip angle and relaxation delay (RD) = 
1.0 s
. Free induction decays (FIDs) were Fourier-transformed with line broadening (LB) = 0.3 Hz. The resulting spectra were manually phased, baseline-corrected, and calibrated to TMS at 0.00 ppm using MestReNova 10.0 (Mestrelab Research S.L.). Spectral intensities were scaled to total intensity and reduced to integrated regions of equal width (0.04 ppm) corresponding to the region of δ 0.32–10.02. The region of δ 7.05–7.49 was removed prior to further analysis because of the residual signal of solvent. The matrix size consisted then of 231 variables.

1D and 2D NMR spectra (

4.5. Multivariate data analysis
</title>
         <p>
Chemometric analysis was performed with SIMCA version 12.0 (Umetrics, Umea, 
Sweden
) in the form of an unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and a supervised orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The scaling was based on Pareto method. With PCA, class differences were determined from a multivariate dataset. Rx 
2
and Q 
2
values described the quality of the model. Rx 
2
indicated goodness of fit and is defined as the proportion of the variance in the data observed in the model. Q 
2
is defined as the proportion of variance in the data that was predictable by the model.

The effect of each crude extract on parasite growth of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. falciparum
</tp:taxon-name>
strain 3D7 was measured in a 48 h growth assay as previously reported (

). Briefly, ring stage parasite cultures were grown for 48 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of crude extract at 37 °C. After 48 h in culture, parasite viability was evaluated by the lactate dehydrogenase inhibition colorimetric test. The half inhibitory concentration (IC 
50
) values are the average of three independent assays with each determination in duplicate and are expressed ± standard deviation. Artemisinin (Sigma-Aldrich, Machelen, 
Belgium
) at an initial concentration of 
100 ng
/mL was used as positive control in all experiments.

4.7. Statistical analysis
</title>
         <p>Preliminary tests of distribution normality and homogeneity of variances were performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test and Bartlett test, respectively. The effect of plant age on the antiplasmodial activity was analysed using parametric one-way analysis of variance. The effect of conditions of culture and environment on the antiplasmodial activity was examined using Student t-tests. Differences in antiplasmodial activity between two concentrations of oligosaccharide solution and two times of incubation were investigated using parametric two-way analysis of variance. All these analyses were performed with R 3.4.2 (R Core Team, 2017).</p>
