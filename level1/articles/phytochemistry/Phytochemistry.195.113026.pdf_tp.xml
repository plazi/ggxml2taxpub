Phytochemical investigation of the ethanol extract from wild 
<tp:taxon-name>
Momordica charantia
</tp:taxon-name>
vines has resulted in isolation of seven cucurbitane-type triterpenoids, including six undescribed compounds, kuguaovins H‒M, and the known compound, momordicoside K. The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analyses, including 1D and 2D NMR, and MS experiments. The chemical structure of momordicoside K was determined for the first time by X-ray crystallographic analysis and its absolute configuration assigned. The cytotoxicity against four human tumor cell lines and anti-inflammatory activities on LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages were evaluated. Of the isolates, kaguaovin L exhibited potential cytotoxicity against MCF-7, HEp-2, Hep-G2, and WiDr cancer cell lines and showed moderate anti-NO production activity. In addition, kuguaovins H and J also showed the stimulatory effect of GLP-1 secretion on the murine intestinal secretin tumor cell line (STC-1).

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
Momordica charantia
</tp:taxon-name>
L. (
<tp:taxon-name>Cucurbitaceae</tp:taxon-name>
), also known as an edible bitter melon (English), goya (
Japan
), or kugua (Chinese area), originating in 
India
, is now widely cultivated in Asia, South America, and Africa. 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. charantia
</tp:taxon-name>
has been used as an herbal medicine for hundreds of years to treat cough, liver heating, stomachic complaints, anthelmintic, and diabetes-related diseases (

; 

). Previous pharmacological investigations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. charantia
</tp:taxon-name>
have revealed various biological activities, such as antiviral (

; 

; 

), antitumor (

; 

; 

), antiulcer (

), antidiabetic (

; 

; 

), anti-obesity (

; 

), antibacterial (

), and anti-inflammatory (

; 

; 

) activity.
</p>
         <p>
Our previous study focused on fruits and isolated cucurbitane-type triterpenoids and their glycosides with promising anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and cytotoxic activities (

; 

; 

). In preliminary bioassay studies on the vines of wild 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. charantia
</tp:taxon-name>
, the CHCl 
3
fraction from the 95% EtOH extract showed an anti-inflammatory effect at a concentration of 10 μg/mL (IC 
50
= 19.85 μg/mL) by inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells. In addition, the fraction also exhibited cytotoxicity against WiDr, Hep-2, HEp-G2, and MCF-7 cancer cells with IC 
50
values of 28.54, 24.12, 22.96, and 31.57 μg/mL, respectively.
</p>
         <p>
In our continuing search for potential components from the bioactive fractions of wild 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. charantia
</tp:taxon-name>
, six undescribed cucurbitane-type triterpene derivatives (
1–6
), together with a known derivative, momordicoside K (
7
) (Murakami et al.,), were isolated and characterized (
Fig. 1
). Structural elucidations of the undescribed isolates were based on detailed spectral analyses, including 2D NMR experiments (
1
H– 
1
H COSY, HSQC, HMBC and NOESY) and spectroscopic comparison with related compounds. In addition, the absolute configuration of compound 
7
was determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis.
</p>
         <p>
Some pharmacological reports have shown that the isolated components and aqueous extracts from 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. charantia
</tp:taxon-name>
exert hypoglycemic effects by elevating GLP-1 secretion (

; 

). Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has been suggested to be an important antidiabetic incretin hormone that is secreted from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 possesses a glucose-dependent insulin stimulatory effect, boosts β- cell function, and suppresses hepatic glucose production and glucagon secretion (

; 

). Since GLP-1 is rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDP4) 
in vivo
, generating stable DPP4-resistant GLP-1 analogs or small molecule-based DPP4 inhibitors has become a major strategy for the treatment of diabetes (

; 

). However, modulation of endogenous GLP-1 levels by using agents that stimulate intestinal GLP-1 secretion has also gradually gained more attention (

; 

). In the present study, the GLP-1 secretory effect of isolated cucurbitanes was evaluated in a murine intestinal secretin tumor cell line (STC-1). The anti-NO production and cytotoxic activities of these compounds are also reported herein.

</title>
         <p>
Compound 
1
, white amorphous powder ([
α
] 25D 67, MeOH), has a molecular formula of C 
41
H 
64
O 
12
as derived from its HRESIMS at 
m/z
771.4291 ([M+Na] 
+
, calcd. for C 
41
H 
64
O 
12
Na, 771.4295). The IR spectrum displayed the absorptions of hydroxyl (
3440 cm
1
), carbonyl (1752 and 
1732 cm
1
), and olefinic (1642 and 
1446 cm
1
) functional groups. The 
13
C- and DEPT NMR spectra of compound 
1
(
Table 1
) revealed the existence of two ester carbonyls (
δ
C
167.5 and 166.8), four olefinic carbons (
δ
C
129.1, 131.6, 132.2, and 132.8), two acetal carbons (
δ
C
104.2 and 112.3), one oxygenated quaternary carbon (
δ
C
84.0), four other quaternary carbons (
δ
C
37.8, 45.4, 48.1, and 48.3), six oxygenated methines (
δ
C
71.8, 75.3, 75.6, 78.2, 78.3, and 78.9), one oxygenated methylene (
δ
C
62.9), eight methylenes (
δ
C
18.4, 23.2, 25.1, 28.2, 30.8, 33.8, 42.2, and 43.8), two methoxyls (
δ
C
52.57 and 33.8), seven methyls (
δ
C
14.8, 18.2, 19.4, 19.9, 20.0, 24.2, and 25.8), and four methines (
δC
32.6, 41.5, 42.1, 51.4). The 
1
H-NMR spectrum of 
1
(
Table 2
) also clearly showed signals for six singlets of methyl (
δ
H
0.86, 0.90, 0.92, 1.18, 1.66, and 1.75), a doublet of methyl [
δ
H
1.17 (d, 
J
=6.0 Hz)], two methoxyls (
δ
H
3.49 and 3.69), eight oxymethine protons (
δ
H
3.88, 4.00, 4.20, 4.22, 4.77, 4.91, 4.93, and 4.95), one oxymethylene proton [
δ
H
4.32 (dd, 
J
= 11.0, 4.0 Hz) and 4.46 (br d, 
J
= 11.0 Hz)], and three olefinic protons [
δ
H
5.59 (dd, 
J
=3.5, 10.0 Hz), 5.61 (br d, 
J
=8.0 Hz), and 6.10 (br d, 
J
= 9.5 Hz)]. The above 
1
H and 
13
C-NMR evidence suggested that compound 
1
possessed a 5,19-epoxycucurbitane-type triterpene skeleton with a sugar moiety and malonyl group and was similar to taikuguasin D isolated from the fruits of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. charantia
</tp:taxon-name>
in a previous report (

). The planar structure of 
1
was further established by 
1
H– 
1
H COSY and HMBC experiments (
Fig. 2A
). The malonyl group was assigned at C-3 based on the HMBC correlation between H-3 (
δ
H
4.38) and C-1’ (
δ
C
166.8). The HMBC correlations of two methoxyl groups (
δ
H
3.69 and 3.49) with 
δ
C
167.5 and 112.3, respectively, suggested that methoxyl groups were linked at C-3 
′
and C-19. Moreover, the sugar moiety at C-23 was clearly determined by the COSY correlations (Glc-1/Glc-2/Glc-3/Glc-4/Glc-5/Glc-6) and HMBC correlations between Glc-1 [
δ
H
4.95 (d, 
J
= 8.0 Hz)] and C-23 (
δ
C
75.3). The hexose sugar moiety was confirmed as 
β
-glucose by the coupling constant of Glc-1, and the D-form was identified by acid hydrolysis of 
1
(

).

Based on the characteristic NOESY correlations of compound 
1
(
Fig. 2B
), major cross-peaks of H-3/Me-28 and Me-29, H-9/Me-29 and Me-30, H-17/Me-30, and H-8/Me-18 and OMe-19 were observed. According to the biosynthetic pathway of cucurbitane-type triterpenes, together with the first reported crystallographic structure of momordicoside K (
7
) (
Fig. 3
), H-3 and H-17 should be in the α- orientation, while H-8 should be in the 
β
-orientation. However, the stereochemistry of C-19 and C-23 was determined as 
R
configuration by comparison with 
1
H and 
13
C-NMR chemical shifts of taikuguasin D. Finally, the complete structure of compound 
1
was established as 3 
β -O
-(3-methoxy-3-oxopropanoyl)-5 
β
,19 
R
-epoxy-19-methoxycucurbita-6,24-dien-3,23-diol 23 
R -O - β
-D-glucopyranoside, and the compound was named kaguaovin H.
</p>
         <p>
Compound 
2
had the same molecular formula deduced from 
m/z
771.4284 ([M+Na] 
+
, calcd. for C 
41
H 
64
O 
12
Na, 771.4295) in the HRESIMS experiment and IR absorptions at 3399, 1754, 1728, 1640, and 
1446 cm
1
as those of compound 
1
. The 
1
H and 
13
C-NMR spectra data (
Tables 1
and 
2
) of both 
1
and 
2
were very similar, suggesting that 
2
is an analog of 
1
. However, the proton signals of H-8 (
δ
H
2.29) and H-19 (
δ
H
4.54) in the 
1
H-NMR spectrum and the carbon signals of C-8 (
δ
C
49.7) and C-19 (
δ
C
114.1) in the 
13
C-NMR spectrum were different from those of 
2
. According to our previous study on the stereochemistry of cucurbitane-type triterpenoids, together with the evidence of NOESY correlation between H-19 and H-8 (
Fig. 2B
), the C-19 configuration of compound 
2
should be 
S
(

). Thus, compound 
2
was a C-19 epimer of 
1
and named kaguaovin I (3 
β -O
-(3-methoxy-3-oxopropanoyl)-5 
β
,19 
S
-epoxy-19-methoxycucurbita-6,24-dien-3,23-diol-23 
R -O -β
-D-glucopyranoside).
</p>
         <p>
Compound 
3
displayed a sodiated quasimoleclar ion peak at 
m/z
685.4283 [M+Na] 
+
in the HRESIMS experiment, consistent with the molecular formula of C 
38
H 
62
O 
9
Na. Its IR spectrum exhibited hydroxyl (
3444 cm
1
) and olefinic (1642 and 
1454 cm
1
) functional groups. The 
1
H-NMR spectrum (
Table 2
) of compound 
3
showed signals for six singlet methyls (
δ
H
0.85, 0.88, 0.91, 1.37, 1.67, and 1.76), one doublet methyl [
δ
H
1.18 (d, 
J
= 6.0 Hz)], one triplet methyl [1.09 (t, 
J
= 8.4 Hz)], eight oxymethine protons [
δ
H
3.55 (br d, 
J
=11.4 Hz), 3.89, 4.03, 4.21, 4.22, 4.86, 4.92 (td, 
J
=4.2, 10.8 Hz), and 4.96 (d, 
J
=8.4 Hz)], and three olefinic protons [
δ
H
5.62 (br d, 
J
=9.0 Hz), 5.64 (dd, 
J
=3.6, 9.6 Hz), and 6.08 (dd, 
J
= 1.2, 9.6 Hz)]. The 
13
C-NMR (
Table 1
) and DEPT spectra displayed 38 signals, including six quaternary carbons, fifteen methine carbons, nine methylene carbons, and eight methyl carbons. Detailed comparison of the 
1
H and 
13
C-NMR data with compounds 
3
and 
1
revealed that both had a structure similar to the 5,19- epoxycucurbitane-type triterpene skeleton with a glucose moiety except for the absence of a malonyl group and the methyl groups in 
3
. Additionally, the signals of 
δ
H
3.39 (m), 3.78 (m) and 1.09 (t, 
J
=8.4 Hz) and 
δ
C
65.9 and 15.5 were found in 
3
, the characteristic of an ethoxyl group that was located at C-19 and confirmed by the HMBC correlation (
Fig. 2A
) between H-19 (
δ
H
4.54) and 19- 
CH
2
CH
3
(
δ
C
65.9). The chemical structure and stereochemistry of 
3
were further confirmed by 
1

         </p>
         <p>
The isolated cucurbitane-type triterpenoids (
1–7
) were evaluated for cytotoxicity against HEp-2 (laryngeal carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), Hep-G2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), and WiDr (colon adenocarcinoma) human cancer cells and anti-inflammatory activity by the inhibition of LPS-stimulated NO production in RAW264.7 macrophage cells. Preliminary results of the cytotoxicity assay (
Table 3
) showed that Kaguaovin K (
4
) exhibited moderate cytotoxicity with IC 
50
values at 9.45 ± 0.51, 9.66 ± 0.34, 8.69 ± 0.46, and 9.23 ± 0.04 μM against MCF-7, HEp-2, Hep-G2, and WiDr cancer cells, respectively, whereas the activities of the other curcubitanes were weak (IC 
50
values =20–40 μM) or inactive (IC 
50
values
&gt;
40 μM). In the anti-inflammatory assay (
Table 4
), all of the tested compounds showed potent anti-NO production with IC 
50
values less than 20 μM. Among them, Kaguaovin K (
4
) exhibited remarkable inhibition of NO production with IC 
50
7.40 ±0.27 at a concentration of 10 μg/mL. In the GLP-1 secretory assay, as shown in 
Fig. 4
A-C, GLP-1 secretory response by STC-1 cells was significantly elevated by compounds 
1
, 
3
, and 
7
at the concentration up to 100 μg/mL. Compounds

3. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
Seven cucurbitane-type triterpenoids, including six undescribed kaguaovins H-M (
1–6
), were successfully isolated by bioassay-directed fractionation from the 95% ethanol extract of the vine of wild 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. charantia
</tp:taxon-name>
. The chemical structures of the undescribed cucurbitanes were determined by 1D and 2D NMR, as well as HRESIMS. Compounds 
1–6
were evaluated for anti-NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW246.7 macrophage cells and cytotoxicity against four human cancer cell lines. Kaguaovin K (
4
) showed potent activity of both anti-NO production and cytotoxicity compared with the others, suggesting that the butenoic ester group at C- 
3 in
cucurbitane-type triterpenoids may obviously increase the bioactivities. Moreover, the 5 
β
,19-epoxycucurbitane glycosides kaguaovins H (
1
) and J (
3
) increase GLP-1 secretory activities in STC-1 cells.

The optical rotations were determined by using a JASCO P-2000 polarimeter. The infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Mattson Genesis II spectrometer (Thermo). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) data were obtained on an LCQ mass spectrometer (Thermo). High-resolution electronic ionization mass spectrometry (HREIMS) data were measured on a Shimadzu IT-TOF HR mass spectrometer. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 400 MHz, Varian Unity Inova 500 MHz, and Varian VNMRS 600 MHz spectrometers. For column chromatography (CC), silica gel 60 (60–230 mesh, Merck) and Sephadex LH-20 (GE) were used. Precoated silica gel (Merck 60 F-254) plates were used for TLC. The spots on TLC were detected by spraying with an anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid (5% H
