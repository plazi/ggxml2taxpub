1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Endophytic fungi are eukaryotic organisms, which exist in healthy plant tissues at certain stages of their lifecycles without causing any noticeable symptoms or harm to the host (

). The symbiotic relationship between endophytic fungi and plants provides a powerful ability to generate biologically active substances (

), such as antibacterial (

; 

), antimalarial (

), antifungal (

), anti-inflammatory, and anticancer agents (

; 

).

, a basidiomycete that biodegrades and turns dead wood white (i.e., white rot), is often used as a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of chronic glomerulonephritis (

). In recent years, several undescribed furan derivatives (i.e., irpexins A-H) (

), sesquiterpenoids (i. e., tremutins A-H (

), irlactins A-K (

, 

, 2019), and irpexolactins A-N (

)), triterpenes (i. e., irpeksolactins A-J) (

), and polyketides (i.e., irpexins I-J) (

) have been isolated from their metabolite compositions, and their bioactivities were explored.

2. Results and discussion
</title>
         <p>
Multiple fermentations and ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extractions yielded a total of 
99.49 g
of crude extract. The nine undescribed isolates and eight previously reported analogs were isolated by various methods, including silica gel, C 
18
reversed-phase silica gel, and Sephadex LH-20. The undescribed isolates were analyzed as follows:
</p>
         <p>
Irpexolaceus A (
1
) was obtained as a colorless oil. The molecular formula was identified as C 
15
H 
20
O 
2
, with six degrees of unsaturation based on the HRESIMS data (
m/z
233.1527 [M + H] 
+
, calcd for C 
15
H 
21
O 
2
, 233.1536). In addition, the 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data of 
1
(
Table 1
) showed structural similarity to tremutin F (

), with the key difference being the absence of a hydroxyl binding to C-4 (
δ
C
21.8) in compound 
1
. The NOESY signals (
Fig. 2
) of Me-13 (
δ
H
0.79)/H-8 
β
(
δ
H
1.59)/Me-14 (
δ
H
1.14) and H-7 (
δ
H
3.11)/Me-15 (
δ
H
1.06)/H-8 
α
(
δ
H
1.83), as well as the lack of H-7/Me-14 and H-8 
β
/Me-15 correlation signals, supported the assignment of Me-13 to 
α
orientation, opposite to that of H-7 (
β
orientation). The predicted electronic CD (ECD) curve of 
1
was calculated using the quantum chemical method at the B3LYP/6-31 + G (d, p) level and the theoretical ECD curve for 6 
R
,7 
R
showed excellent agreement with the experimental one (
Fig. 3
). Therefore, the absolute configuration of 
1
was identified to 6 
R
,7 
R
.
</p>
         <p>
Irpexolaceus B (
5
), a colorless needle-like crystal, was assigned the molecular formula C 
15
H 
22
O 
3
, with five degrees of unsaturation based on the HRESIMS data (
m/z
251.1638 [M+H] 
+
, calcd for C 
15
H 
23
O 
3
, 251.1642). The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data of 
5
(
Table 1
) showed high similarity to the co-isolate irpexolactin J (
8
) (

). The NOESY correlations (
Fig. 2
) of Me-13 (
δ
H
1.03)/Me-14 (
δ
H
1.09)/H-1 (
δ
H
2.96) and H-6 (
δ
H
2.14)/H-7 (
δ
H
2.10)/H 
2
-15 (
δ
H
3.36, 3.33) suggested that Me-13, Me-14, and H-1 were on the same orientation and different from H-6, H-7, and H-15. Considering the differences in 
5
and 
8
regarding optical rotation and retention time (
t
R
) for HPLC analysis, they were determined as stereoisomers. The absolute configuration of 
5
was established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (
Fig. 4
) and unequivocally determined to be 1 
S
,6 
R
,7 
R
,9 
S
.
</p>
         <p>
Irpexolaceus C (
9
), a colorless oil, was identified with a molecular formula of C 
20
H 
27
NO 
5
, with eight degrees of unsaturation based on HRESIMS data at 
m/z
362.1960 [M+H] 
+
(calcd for C 
20
H 
28
NO 
5
, 362.1962). The 1D and 2D NMR spectra exhibited the same relative configuration to compound 
5
, except for the C 
5
moiety, which was an ester of 
5
at C-15, as the HMBC spectrum (
Fig. 5
) showed a correlation between H 
2
-15 (
δ
H
4.00, 3.97) and C-16 (
δ
C
174.1), and the carbon signal at 
δ
71.7 in
compound 
5
shifted downfield to 
δ
74.2 in
compound 
9
.
</p>
         <p>
The 1D NMR data (
Table 1
) also revealed the presence of two methylenes [
δ
H
2.19 (m, H-18 
β
), 2.50 (m, H-18 
α
), and 2.35 (m, H-19); 
δ
C
26.0 (C-18), 30.2 (C-19)], one methine [
δ
H
4.32 (dd, 
J
= 9.1, 4.1 Hz, H-17); 
δ
C
57.2 (C-17)], and two carboxyl units [
δ
C
174.1 (C-16), 181.0 (C-20)]. These data indicated the presence of a fragment structure of pyroglutamate, through further NMR data analysis of C 
5
moiety identified it as 2(
S
)-pyroglutamate. These results are in accordance with previous 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data (

; 

), as well as the theoretical and experimental ECD curves for 
S
in compound H1-1 (Fig. S104), which was also isolated in this study. Therefore, compound 
9
was biosynthesized by the esterification of 
5
and H1- 
1 in
<tp:taxon-name>
I. lacteus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Fig. S105), and its theoretical ECD curve for 1 
S
,6 
R
,7 
R
,9 
S
,17 
S
was in good agreement with the experimental curve (
Fig. 6
). The absolute configuration of 
9
was determined to be 1 
S
,6 
R
,7 
R
,9 
S
,17 
S
.

         <p>
Irpexonjust A (
10
) and irpexonjust B (
11
) were obtained as yellowish powders, with the same molecular formula of C 
12
H 
18
O 
4
and four degrees of unsaturation based on HRESIMS data at 
m/z
227.1278 [M+H] 
+
(calcd for C 
12
H 
19
O 
4
, 227.1278) and 227.1277 [M+H] 
+
(calcd for C 
12
H 
19
O 
4
, 227.1278), respectively. The 1D NMR data of 
10
(
Table 2
) demonstrated high similarity to irpexlacte D (

), with the main difference being that the carboxyl at C- 
11 in
irpexlacte D was substituted by a hydroxyl in compound 
10
, as determined by the 
1
H– 
1
H COSY correlations of H-8 (
δ
H
2.76)/H 
2
-9 (
δ
H
1.83, 1.74)/H-10 (
δ
H
1.49)/H-11 (
δ
H
3.75)/H-12 (
δ
H
1.16), and HMBC correlations from H-11 (
δ
H
3.75) to C-9 (
δ
C
25.1), C-10 (
δ
C
39.4), and C-12 (
δ
C
23.5) (
Fig. 5
). Compared to 
10
, the hydroxyl of 
11
was located at C-10 rather than C-11, as confirmed by the 
1
H– 
1
H COSY correlations of H 
2
-8 (
δ
H
2.89, 2.79)/H 
2
-9 (
δ
H
1.88, 1.74)/H-10 (
δ
H
3.47)/H-11 (
δ
H
1.50)/H-12 (
δ
H
0.93), and HMBC correlations from H 
2
-8 (
δ
H
2.89, 2.79), H 
2
-9 (
δ
H
1.88, 1.74), H-11 (
δ
H
1.50), and H-12 (
δ
H
0.93) to C-10 (
δ
C
72.9) (
Fig. 5
). The planar structures of 
10
and 
11
are given in 
Fig. 1
. Unfortunately, stereochemical determination using the Mosher method proved difficult due to the limited amounts these compounds.

         <p>
Irpexolaceus D (
12
) and irpexolaceus F (
16
) were isolated as yellowish oils, and assigned the same molecular formula of C 
15
H 
22
O 
4
, with five degrees of unsaturation based on HRESIMS data at 
m/z
267.1584 [M+H]

(calcd for C 
15
H 
23
O

+
(calcd for C 
15
H 
22
NaO 
4
, 289.1410), respectively. The 1D NMR data of 
12
(
Table 1
) were highly similar to davotremulane B (

). The NOESY correlations (
Fig. 2
) of Me-14 (
δ
H
1.10)/H-5 (
δ
H
3.83)/H-7 (
δ
H
2.12) and Me-13 (
δ
H
1.03)/H-1 (
δ
H
2.86)/H 
2
-15 (
δ
H
3.34, 3.32) indicated the same orientation of Me-14, H-5, and H-7, different from Me-13, H-1, and H-15. The absolute configuration of 
12
was determined to be 1 
S
,5 
R
,6 
S
,7 
S
,9 
R
using single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (
Fig. 7
). Compound 
16
had the same molecular formula as davotremulane B but differed in the configurations of C-1 and C-6 based on the NOESY correlations (
Fig. 2
) of Me-14 (
δ
H
1.05)/H-1 (
δ
H
3.08)/Me-13 (
δ
H
1.16) and H-15 (
δ
H
3.33, 3.32)/H-7 (
δ
H
2.05)/H-5 (
δ
H
4.71). The calculated and experimental ECD spectra of 
16
showed excellent fit (
Fig. 6
), indicating that the absolute configuration of 
16
was 1 
R
,5 
S
,6 
R
,7 
R
,9 
R
.

         <p>
Irpexolaceus E (
13
) was obtained as a yellowish oil, with a molecular formula of C 
15
H 
22
O 
4
, and five degrees of unsaturation based on HRESIMS data at 
m/z
267.1586 [M+H] 
+
(calcd for C 
15
H 
23
O 
4
, 267.1591). The 1D NMR data of 
13
(
Table 1

17
were similar to (

Biogenetically, tremulane (
i
) and (
ii
) were biosynthesized based on the relative structures of compounds 
1
, 
2
, 
5
, 
9
, 
12
, 
13
, and 
16
by cyclization and rearrangement of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) (
Fig. 8
). Tremulenolide D (
2
) (

), which was synthesized by a series of reactions of tremulane (
i
), may be considered a precursor of 
1
, 
5
, 
9
, 
12
, and 
13
. Under the catalysis of oxidase, tremulenolide D was converted to compounds 
1
, 
5
, 
9
, 
12
, and 
13
. Interestingly, the configuration of 
16
differed from that of the other isolates, especially the carbon configurations of C-1 and C-7, and was possibly derived from tremulane (
ii
) obtained by cyclization of FPP (
Fig. 8
). Lactarane skeletons 
ii-1
, 
ii-2
, and 
ii-3
were produced by a series of methyl migrations, as reported in the fungus 
<tp:taxon-name>

, the isomeride of tremulane, underwent esterification and catalytic oxidase

In addition to the above-mentioned isolate analyses, the absolute configurations of irpexlacte B (

Table 2
. Along with six congeners, tremulenolide D (

The 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-2)-3,5-diphenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) assay (

) was used to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of the nine undescribed isolates and

on RAW 264.7 cells. When the concentrations of compounds

4

11
, and 
16
were

100 
μ
g/mL, cell viability was less than 80%. Therefore, these test compounds were considered non-cytotoxic to RAW 264.7 cells after 24 h of incubation at low concentration (25 and 50 
μ
g/mL) (Fig. S106). We further evaluated the inhibitory effects of these compounds on NO production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Results showed that NO release was suppressed after exposure to compounds

3. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
In this study, nine undescribed compounds, including six tremulane-type sesquiterpenoids, one phenolic bisabolane-type sesquiterpenoid, and two furan derivatives, along with eight previously reported analogs, were isolated from the metabolite composition of endophytic fungi 
<tp:taxon-name>
I. lacteus

</tp:taxon-name>
38. The structures of these isolates were assigned based on
</p>
         <p>
NMR, HRESIMS, IR, UV, ECD, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Eleven isolates, including 
3
and 
4
, were evaluated for anti-inflammatory activity by detecting their inhibitory effects on NO production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. At a concentration of 50 
μ
g/ mL, compound 
17
(56.7%), one phenolic bisabolene-type sesquiterpenoid, and compound 
11
(55.7%), with a hydroxyl binding to C-10, not to C-11 (as in 
10
), exhibited remarkable inhibitory effects against NO release compared to the other nine isolates. The inhibition of NO production by compound 
16
(50.2%) was stronger than that by compound 
12
(47.3%), which showed the same planar structure but different absolute configurations (compound 
16

1
(49.8%) exhibited a higher inhibition ratio than compounds 
12
(47.3%) and 
9
(45.8%). Therefore, 
17
and 
11
could be considered as potential compounds for further anti-inflammatory studies.

4.6. ECD calculation
</title>
         <p>
Initial conformational searches were carried out using Spartan 10 software with the Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF) (

). The conformers with a Boltzmann population of over 1% were chosen for ECD calculations. The conformers were subjected to gas-phase QM geometry optimizations and frequency calculations at B3LYP/6-31 + G before solvated geometry optimizations at M062X/TZVP with SDM-IEFPCM in MeOH. The ECD spectra for all conformers of compounds 
1
, 
3
, 
4
, 
9
, and 
16
were conducted by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methodology at the 
ω
B97X/def2-TZVP using IEFPCM in methanol, CAM-B3LYP/TZVP with IEFPCM in MeOH, and M062X/def2-TZVP with IEFPCM in MeOH (

). The ECD spectra were generated using the program SpecDis v1.71 from dipole-length rotational strength by applying Gaussian band shapes with sigma = 0.2 eV (

).

4.7. Cytotoxicity assay

The RAW 264.7 cells (8 ×

Utah

USA
) in an incubator with 5% CO

at 37

C for 12 h until the cells adhered to the wall. After this, another 100 
μ
L of DMEM was added to each well in the presence of test compounds using the 2-fold dilution method (from 100 to 1.5625 
μ
g/mL) (

), with 0.1% DMSO used as the negative control and DMEM medium without any compounds used as the blank group. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37

C. A 20- 
μ
L aliquot of MTT (
4 mg
/mL) was added to each well for 4 h incubation at 37 
◦
C. The supernatant was carefully removed and 200 
μ
L of DMSO was added to each well with gentle shaking to fully dissolve the purple crystal formazan, followed by determining at 
570 nm
on a microplate reader (Biotek Elx800, Winooski, VT,

4.8. Nitric oxide (NO) production assay
</title>
         <p>
NO production was determined using the Griess reagent assay (

), with slight modification. The RAW 264.7 cells (8 × 10 
4
cells/well) were treated with test compounds (25 and 50 
μ
g/mL) in the presence of LPS (1 
μ
g/mL) for 24 h at 37 
◦
C in 96-well plates. Cells treated with LPS only were used as a model group and cells in DMEM without compounds or LPS were used as a blank group. The RAW 264.7 cell culture supernatant was harvested for analysis with Griess reagent. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the optical densities were measured at 
550 nm
. The concentration of NO was estimated according to the standard curve of sodium nitrite. All values are given as means ± standard deviation (SD). Data analysis involved one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with subsequent Scheffe’ s test.
