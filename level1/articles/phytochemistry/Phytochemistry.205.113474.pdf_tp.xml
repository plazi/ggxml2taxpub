         <p>
Nine previously undescribed compounds including three sesquiterpenoids, three iridoids, two monoterpenoids and a furan fatty acid, along with seventeen known ones, were isolated from the water decoction of roots and rhizomes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Valeriana officinalis
L
</tp:taxon-name>
. Structure elucidation of the twenty-six compounds were accomplished by analysis of the extensive spectroscopic data, and the absolute configurations of the nine previously undescribed ones were established by NOESY experiment and the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) simulations. Among them, 
β-
patchoulene-8- 
O-β-
D-glucopyranoside, 11-methoxyl-viburtinal, and protocatechuic acid showed anti-neuroinflammatory potentials by significantly inhibiting the secretion of nitric oxide (NO) on BV-2 cells upon LPS stimulation (

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
As is known, iridoids and volatile oil have been recognized as the two major constituents in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Valeriana
</tp:taxon-name>
(

; 

). And so far, nearly 110 iridoids (

; 

; 

, 

; 

; 

; 

; 

, 2020) have been discovered from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Valeriana
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, possessing numerous valuable efficacies such as sleep-promoting (

), anti-anxiety (

), sedative (D. 

), and anti-spasmodic (

; 

; 

) activities. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Valeriana officinalis
L
</tp:taxon-name>
. (
<tp:taxon-name>Valerianaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) is one of the most commonly used plants in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Valeriana
</tp:taxon-name>
genus, and it is frequently prescribed in the form of water decoction in most traditional medicinal systems (

; 

; 

). However, few modern phytochemical studies (

) focus on the water-soluble constituents of 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. officinalis
</tp:taxon-name>
despite the fact that modern pharmacological investigations have uncovered the significant anticonvulsant (

), anti-coronaryspastic, anti-hypertensive and anti-bronchospastic activities (

) of the aqueous extracts (or water decoctions) of 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. officinalis
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
Herein, during our preparation and chemical fingerprinting of the components of common Chinese medicines (CMs), phytochemical study on the water-soluble components of roots and rhizomes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. officinalis
</tp:taxon-name>
afforded the isolation of twenty-six compounds, including nine previously undescribed compounds (
1–9
, 
Fig. 1
) and the seventeen known ones (Supplementary Fig. S82), with structures assigned by analysis of the extensive spectroscopic data, aided by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. Furthermore, a Griess method (

) was applied to evaluate the anti-neuroinflammatory potentials of those isolates on the secretion of nitric oxide (NO) by LPS stimulation in BV-2 cells (

; 

; 

; 

).

deduced by analysis of their HRESIMS (Supplementary 
Figs. S1
and S9) and NMR (
Table 1
) data. 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra of 
1
and 
2
were both composed of the characteristic proton and carbon resonances assignable to an oxygenated patchouli alcohol (

), as similar in the known 8-acetoxyl-patchouli alcohol (
11
) (

) and valeriananoid A (
12
) (

). As detailed in 
Table 1
and 
Figs. 2
and 
3
, overall comparison of the NMR data between 
1
and 
2
revealed that C-3 (
δ
C
76.6, a methine oxygenated by an acetoxyl group) in 
1
was oxygenated instead of the C-8 (
δ
C
81.4, an oxygenated methine glycosylated by a glucose) in 
2
. And, the C-6’ (a hydroxymethyl with 
δ
C
68.7) of the glucopyranosyl moiety in 
2
was substituted by another apiofuranosyl moiety as indicated by comparing its NMR data with those of valeriananoid F (
13
) (

), a known 8- 
O -β
-D-glucopyranosyl-patchouli alcohol. The existence of D-glucose and D-apiose in 
2
was confirmed by precolumn derivatization HPLC analysis of acid hydrolysate of 
2
(Supplementary Fig. S80) (Fan, et al., 2019). In NOESY spectrum of 
2
, the presence of correlation between H-2" (
δ
H
3.89, d, 
J
=2.4 Hz) and H-4 
′′
b (
δ
H
3.95, d, 
J
=10.2 Hz) and the absence of correlation between H-2 
′′
and H-1" (
δ
H
5.00, d, 
J
= 2.4 Hz) indicated a 
β
-D-configuration of the apiofuranosyl moiety (Picmanova ˇ´ and 

; Juliao ˜et al., 2010). And the 
β
-configuration of the glucopyranosyl moiety was projected by the 
3
J
coupling constant between H-1 
′
and H-2 
′
, which was above 7.0 Hz. Thus, 
1
and 
2
were accordingly identified as 3-acetoxyl-patchouli alcohol and patchouli alcohol 8- 
O -β
-D-apiofuranosyl-(1 → 6)- 
β
-D-glucopyranoside.
</p>
         <p>
Since 
1
possessed the same patchouli alcohol-skeleton as 
2
and 
10–12
, the absolute configurations of the C-1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10 were then proposed as 1

R
, 4 
R

, 7

and 10

in clue of their homology in biogenetic pathways. NOESY correlations between 
δ

δ
H
1.12 (3H, s, H 
3
-14), 0.892 (3H, d, 
J
=6.6 Hz, H 
3
-12) indicated an 
α
-orientation of the acetoxyl moiety in 
1
. The absolute configuration of 
1
was then determined by comparison of its experimental ECD data with those calculated by TDDFT method (

). The experimental ECD spectrum matched well with that calculated for 1

b)/62.8, combined with the precolumn derivatization HPLC analysis of acid hydrolysate of 
3
(Supplementary Fig. S81), revealed the presence of a 
β-
D-glucopyranosyl moiety in 
3
. The HMBC correlation of 
δ
H
3.95 (H-8) with 
δ
C
103.4 (C-1

) revealed that the glycosidation occurred at the C-8 of the 
β

3
. Thus, the planar structure of 
3
was finally elucidated as a previously undescribed 8- 
O
-glucoside derivative of 
β

3
was proposed by analysis of the NOESY data (
Fig. 2
). NOESY correlations of H 
3

3
-14 and H 
3
-15/H-8 indicated that H 
3
-12, H 
3

β

3
was determined by comparison of its experimental ECD spectra with those calculated by TDDFT method (

suggested the existence of a monoterpenoid scaffold featuring a 6,7-dioxygenated octahydrocyclopenta[

in

the same deuterated solvent (CD

It has been well-recognized that neuroinflammation is closely related to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, can drive pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases once it has begun. and microglia are the key cell 
type
in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation (

). Herein, the activities of those isolates on the viability and the NO production of BV-2 cells upon LPS stimulation, were evaluated for their anti-neuroinflammatory properties (

didn’ t exert any significant effects on the cell viability of BV-2 cells, indicating that they didn’ t show any cytotoxicities on BV-2 cells at the concentration of 10

4.4. Acid hydrolysis of compounds 2 and 3
</title>
         <p>
To determine the absolute configuration of monosaccharide constituents of isolated compounds, the method of PMP (1-phenyl-3- methyl-5-pyrazolone)-HPLC analysis upon acid hydrolysis (Fan, et al., 2019) was used. Each solution of 
2
and 
3
(each 1.0 mg) in 2 M HCl (2 ml) was heated at 90 
◦
C for 3 h. Each solution mixture was then extracted three times with CHCl 
3
(2.0 ml). The H 
2
O layer was dried in vacuum to produce a mixture of monosaccharides. Sugars of each sample were dissolved in H 
2
O (0.5 ml) containing 0.3 M (0.2 ml) NaOH and 0.5 M PMP (0.2 ml) and heated at 70 
◦
C for 0.5 h. 0.3 M HCl (0.2 ml) was added into each reaction mixture, which was then extracted three times with CHCl 
3
(1.0 ml) to remove the PMP. The collected supernatants were analyzed by a HPLC system (Agilent 1260 Infinity II) equipped with a PDA detector (detection wavelength: 
250 nm
) and a COSMOSIL C 
18
column (

As similar process as our previous study reported (

) relative configuration of

, 
3–8
was deduced by analysis of 1D and 2D NMR data and Chem3D modeling. Stochastic conformational searches were firstly performed under the MMFF94 force field using CONFLEX 8 software to afford the low energy conformers. By TDDFT method, geometry optimizations and the frequencies pre-calculations for verifying the stabilities of the conformers, were finished by Gaussian 16 package (Revision C.01) at the B3LYP/6–311 +g (2d, p) basis set level in MeOH. Using the optimized conformers, one hundred excitation states at the B3LYP/6–311 +g (2d, p) level with a IEFPCM solvent model in MeOH or Water were calculated for compounds 
1
, 
3–8
with a half bandwidth of 0.35–0.50 eV, and the calculation results of different conformers were Boltzmann averaged to simulate the ECD spectra after UV correction, which were finally extracted by SpecDis 1.70.1 software.
