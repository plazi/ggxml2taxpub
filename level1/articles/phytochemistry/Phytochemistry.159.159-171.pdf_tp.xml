. RsBBI (9216 Da) and RsKI (19,412 Da) exhibited self-association pattern as revealed by western blotting with anti-BBI antibody and

peptide mass fingerprint analysis, respectively. RsBBI and RsKI varied significantly in their biochemical, biophysical and insecticidal properties. RsBBI inhibited the activity of trypsin (

Ki
= 807.8 ± 23.7 nM) while RsKI (
Ki
= 172.0 ± 9.2 nM) inhibited the activity of trypsin alone, by non-competitive mode. The trypsin inhibitor (
TI
) and chymotrypsin inhibitor (CI) activities of RsBBI were stable up to 100 °C. But, RsBBI completely lost its

and CI activities on reduction with 3 mM DTT. Conversely, RsKI lost its

activity in presence of 3 mM DTT. CD spectroscopic studies on RsBBI and RsKI showed their secondary structural elements in the following order: random coils&gt; β-sheets/β-turns&gt; α-helix. However, RsKI showed reversible denaturation midpoint (

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Seeds are the vehicles for continuity of next generation and contain various proteinaceous enzyme inhibitors such as amylase inhibitors and proteinase/protease inhibitors (PIs) (

). PIs are expressed constitutively in reproductive organs or induced in vegetative organs during biotic and abiotic stresses (

; 

). They also act as pseudosubstrates of proteases and stabilize them during desiccation. The PIs are rapidly degraded during seed germination to release essential amino acids and they reappear in cotyledons to protect them from invading pests and pathogens. They also take part in programmed cell death in plants. Bowman-Birk inhibitors (BBIs) and Kunitz inhibitors are widely studied among serinetype PIs across Leguminosae family members. The BBIs are 6–9 kDa proteins with seven intrachain disulfide bridges to stabilize its structure and contained two reactive sites for trypsin and chymotrypsin on opposite sides of the molecule. Conversely, the Kunitz inhibitors are ca. 20 kDa proteins with two disulfide bridges and contained a single reactive site for its cognate proteases such as trypsin or chymotrypsin (

).

Insects induce huge yield loss in crop plants by feeding on them. In response to feeding, the PIs expressed as a part of the defense mechanism in crop plants inhibit the digestive proteases present in the insect gut and thereby reduce the bioavailability of free amino acids (

). During the process of host-pest coevolution, insect gut proteases are adapted to the PIs of domesticated crop plants by overexpressing the existing proteases or synthesizing alternative proteases (

; 

). In this scenario, PIs from few non-host plants and wild relatives are suggested as potential candidates to inhibit the gut proteases of host insects since their guts are not exposed to such kind of PIs earlier. Many transgenic plants expressing PIs from non-host and wild relatives are reported to counteract the insect pests (

; 

; 

; 

; 

). Therefore, a continuous screening of non-hosts and wild relatives is essential to identify effective ecofriendly PIs to target economically important insect pests such as 
<tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
(

(a polyphagous pest) and 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
(a major pest on

) has been a major challenge since they are efficient in overcoming defense mechanisms of host plant and chemical pesticides due to their broad host range and voracious feeding behaviour.

and known to harbor a rich pool of defensive proteins including PIs. The studies on different species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rhynchosia</tp:taxon-name>
indicated the presence of PIs active against trypsin-like gut proteases of 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. armigera
</tp:taxon-name>
in their seeds (

; 

). Further studies with the crude protease inhibitors (CPIs) from 
<tp:taxon-name>

seeds
</tp:taxon-name>
showed remarkable reduction in the activity of gut trypsin-like proteases from 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. armigera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. janata
(
Mohanraj et al., 2018
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the seeds of 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
might possess different kinds of PIs to defend the gut trypsin-like proteases of both 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. armigera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
. Furthermore, as several classes of PIs are active against trypsin, it is important to identify and understand the properties of PIs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sublobata
</tp:taxon-name>
. Thus, in the present study, PIs which are active against gut trypsin-like proteases of 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. armigera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. janata

are purified and characterized for their biochemical and biophysical properties.

fractionated CPI was resolved into two peaks in trypsin-affinity column when eluted with 
0.01 N

<tp:taxon-name>
R. sublobata
</tp:taxon-name>
trypsin specific protease inhibitors “RsPI” (

) and it showed two major bands when separated in Tricine SDS-PAGE (

). The lower major band apparently possessed molecular mass of ca. 13 kDa or 8 kDa when compared with commercially available protein molecular weight marker (PMWM) and soybean Bowman-Birk Inhibitor (SBBI), respectively. This discrepancy is very common in TIs, particularly among those which are known to self-associate depending on the method of molecular weight determination such as ultra-centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE, 2-D gel electrophoresis or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (
Bergeron and Nielsen, 1993
and references therein; 
Swathi et al., 2014
, 
2016
). However, molecular mass of lower band is assumed to be closer to 8 kDa considering its similar migration pattern with SBBI as compared to PMWM marker. In contrast, the upper band which showed molecular mass of ca. 20 kDa is well in range with both PMWM and SBBI. Further, this discrepancy in molecular mass was monitored by loading both SBBI and RsPI in all gels performed in this study.

2.2. IEF of RsPI and identification of RsBBI and RsKI by Edman
degradation method
</title>
         <p>
The RsPI is resolved into several isoinhibitors on IEF followed by second-dimension PAGE. The isoinhibitor spots in the 8 kDa region were distributed between pI 4.3 and pI 6.2, while the isoinhibitors spots in the 20 kDa region were distributed between pI 4.4 and pI 6.7 (
Fig. 2A
). Further, the 2DE combined with in-gel 
TI
activity assay indicated isoinhibitor spots in 20 kDa region are active against trypsin even after reduction of RsPI with DTT/IDA whereas the isoinhibitor spots in 8 kDa region are inactive (
Fig. 2B
). These results suggest RsPI possess isoinhibitors from atleast two different PI families and the structural stability of isoinhibitors from 8 kDa region is influenced by redox-sensitive disulfide bridges.
</p>
         <p>
Further, the N-terminal sequencing of the isoinhibitor (spot 1) with pI 4.9 and molecular mass ca. 20 kDa by Edman degradation method revealed the following 20 amino acid sequence “DFVLDTDGDPLQNG-GRYFIL” which showed 70% identity to Trypsin inhibitors A (ITRA_SOYBN) &amp; B (ITRB_SOYBN) and 75% identity to Kunitz trypsin inhibitors 1 (KTI1_SOYBN) and 2 (KTI2_SOYBN) of soybean from UniProt data base (
Fig. 2A and C
). Conversely, N-terminal sequencing of the isoinhibitor (spot 2) with pI 5.0 and molecular mass ca. 8 kDa revealed the following amino acid sequence “SDHHHHHSSSSDEP” which showed 43–71% identity to the N-terminus of BBIs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Macrotyloma axillare
</tp:taxon-name>
(IBB4_MACAX), soybean (IBB1_SOYBN), 
<tp:taxon-name>

(IBB2_PHAVU) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. acutifolius
</tp:taxon-name>
(IBB_PHAAT), respectively from the above database (
Fig. 2A and D
). Also, N-terminal sequencing performed for spot 3 of pI 6.0 and molecular mass ca. 20 kDa revealed the sequence of first five amino acids as “DFVLD” and they were similar to that obtained for spot 1 (
Fig. 2A
). Taken together, these results suggested the presence of Bowman-Birk isoinhibitors (RsBBI) and Kunitz isoinhibitors (RsKI) in the seeds of

A variety of protocols are applied by various research groups to separate BBIs and Kunitz inhibitors present in a single seed variety which included (i) multiple chromatographic steps; (ii) preparative native gels; and (iii) application of different processing steps after extraction into a suitable organic solvent (

;

). All these methods were highly time-consuming and involved a tedious process. Also, in the present study, separation of RsBBI and RsKI from RsPI using the principles of chromatography was found to be very difficult for the following reasons: (a) both RsBBI and RsKI are TIs (
Fig. 2C and D
); (b) close proximity in the molecular mass of RsBBI and RsKI (
Figs. 1C
and 
2A
); and (c) most of the isoinhibitors of RsBBI and RsKI showed overlapping in their pI values (
Fig. 2A
). Besides, usage of the columns such


as Superdex G-75 and MonoQ Sepharose, and procedures like 10 kDa cut-off spin columns or simple SDS-PAGE gel elution techniques could not separate RsBBI and RsKI from RsPI. The hydrophobic interaction chromatography using Phenyl Sepharose 6 fast flow method separated the RsBBI and RsKI from RsPI on decreasing ammonium sulfate gradient (Data not shown). But, this procedure involved extensive time-consuming post processing steps such as buffer exchange and sample concentration to isolate them in pure forms. Therefore, during this study, a short and quick method was introduced to separate RsBBI and RsKI from RsPI based on their differential solubility properties in TCA and sodium acetate, respectively (
Fig. 3A
). 


In the first phase, RsBBI was separated from RsPI by extracting into 2.5% TCA at 70 °C. Subsequently, the supernatant ‘S1’ enriched with RsBBI is subjected to acetone precipitation and the pellet was 

solubilized in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. This step was repeated to extract the BBI totally from RsPI. In the second phase, RsKI is separated from RsPI by extracting the P1 pellet after TCA extraction into 50 mM Sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0. The supernatant ‘S2’ enriched with RsKI is subsequently subjected to acetone precipitation and the pellet was solubilized in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (
Fig. 3A
). TCA is known to increase the hydrophobicity of the proteins by exposing their hydrophobic core and thereby induce bulk protein precipitation. Hence, exposure of RsPI to 2.5% TCA at 70 °C resulted in precipitation of RsKI with hydrophobic core as pellet “P1” (
Fig. 3A and B
). Conversely, BBIs are low molecular mass, globular, water soluble proteins with hydrophilic core and surface hydrophobic patch (

). These properties of RsBBI allowed it to be retained in the soluble fraction (S1) on mild TCA precipitation and it exhibited self-association pattern (homo-dimer and -trimer) in solution. Since, Kunitz inhibitors are also reported to be soluble in acetate buffers (

), the extraction of RsKI enriched pellet ‘P1'with Sodium acetate (pH 4.0) retained RsKI in the supernatant ‘S2’. Thus, a simple and costeffective method is developed to separate RsBBI and RsKI from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sublobata
</tp:taxon-name>
within a short period of 2 h. This protocol yielded 
4.26 mg
of RsBBI and 
1.08 mg
of RsKI from 
10 g
of seeds accounting to 50- and 23- fold of purification, respectively. RsBBI is highly active against bovine trypsin enzyme (1780.28 TI units/mg protein) than RsKI (837.03 TI units/mg protein;

2.4. Confirmation of RsBBI and RsKI by immunodetection, mass
spectrometry and 2DE
</title>
         <p>
The homogeneity of RsBBI and RsKI separated from RsPI was visualized in 15% Tricine SDS-PAGE (
Fig. 3B
). Loading of RsBBI and RsKI at increasing concentrations demonstrated the presence of these PIs in higher order conformations (
Fig. 3C
). Further, probing with anti-BBI antibody revealed the existence of RsBBI as monomer, dimer and tetramer (
Fig. 3D
). Furthermore, RsKI which existed as monomer and dimer did not show any reaction with anti-BBI antibody. This in turn confirmed the absence of any traces of RsBBI in S2 (
Fig. 3A–D
). Besides, the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) spectra of the higher order bands of RsBBI (dimer and tetramer) and RsKI (dimer) with corresponding monomers demonstrated their self-association property (Supplementary 
Figs. 1
and 
2
). Furthermore, when an identical peak from all the PMF spectra of RsBBI (ca. 1708 Da) and RsKI (ca. 1201 Da) were ionized (MS/MS) and de novo sequenced (Supplementary 
Fig. 3A,B,C
; 
Fig. 4A and B
) the obtained sequence matched with the related BBIs and Kunitz inhibitors (Supplementary 
Fig. 5A and B
).
</p>
         <p>
Intact mass analysis of purified ‘RsBBI’ and ‘RsKI’ using 
MALDI-TOF
mass spectroscopy studies confirmed that they existed as small oligomers in solution (
Fig. 4A and B
). The appearance of (i) three peaks for RsBBI with molecular masses 9216.4 Da (monomer), 18,427.4 Da (dimer) and 27,693.0 Da (trimer), and (ii) two peaks for RsKI with molecular masses 19,412.6 Da (monomer) and 38,811.0 Da (dimer) corroborated with the higher ordered conformation observed in SDS-PAGE (
Fig. 3C
). However, the appearance of RsBBI in trimeric state during intact 
MALDI-TOF
analysis and tetrameric state in Tricine SDS-PAGE could be due to variation in the technique applied and the concentration of RsBBI used (
Fig. 3C
and 
4A
). Sismilarly, the oligomeric nature of 
SBBI
which is used as a control varied significantly in different gels (
Figs. 1C
, 
2A
and 
3B,C
). Thus, the results from the present study revealed that RsBBI self-associate to form dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric states (
Figs. 3C,D
and 
4A
). Oligomerisation of BBIs is well-known and occurred as a very common phenomenon when compared with Kunitz inhibitors (

; 

; 

). The purified BBIs from cultivars of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. cajan
</tp:taxon-name>
were reported to possess self-association tendency and existed from monomeric to pentameric states (

; 

). Thermodynamically, the existence of BBIs in solution as monomer is suggested as an unfavorable reaction (

; 

). Perhaps, oligomerisation of BBIs might increase their thermal stability and resistance to enzyme digestion (

). The BBI from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Vigna ungiculata
</tp:taxon-name>
is reported to form a very tight dimeric structures (

). The studies of 

hypothesized existence of dimeric and tetrameric structures, and their transitions at equilibria for black-eyed pea trypsin-chymotrypsin-inhibitor and 
TI
. The opposite electrostatic potential between the 
TI
domain of one molecule of BBI and the CI domain of second molecule of BBI render them together during formation of higher order conformations (

). Precisely, Lys 
24
at the 
TI
reactive site of first monomer is shown to interact with the Asp 
76
of the CI reactive site of second monomer in BBI of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dolichos biflorus
(
Kumar et al., 2004
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. But, the dimerization of Kunitz inhibitors as observed in RsKI (
Figs. 3B
and 
4B
) is rarely found and reported from species such as 

<tp:taxon-name>C. platycarpus</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>Canavalia lineata</tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>

(

         <p>

Further, IEF of RsBBI and RsKI followed by SDS-PAGE on second dimension visualized the different isoinhibitors of Bowman-Birk and Kunitz family in the acidic range (
Fig. 4C and D
). Since, both plants and insects are evolving independently and together, presence of multiple isoinhibitors in plants is suggested to play a strategic role in protecting themselves against invading predators (

; 

; 

). The polymorphic nature of TIs is also evident in several wild relatives of 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. volubilis
</tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. ceratotropis
</tp:taxon-name>
(

;

,b;

; 

). Further, multiple isoinhibitors have been arisen in plants, possibly due to events such as gene duplication/multi-gene products and/or post translational modifications both at N- and C-terminal ends (

).
</p>
         <p>
Furthermore, the following N-terminal sequences, ‘SSSDEPSESSN-NCCDQ’ and ‘I/LI/LNGGTYYVRGAI/LRGDGGGI/LE’ are identified by MALDI-ISD spectrum in RsBBI and RsKI (Supplementary 
Fig. 6A and B
). The BLAST analysis of these sequences showed a significant identity to BBIs from 
<tp:taxon-name>Phaseolus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Vigna, Horse</tp:taxon-name>
gram and soybean and Kunitz inhibitors from soybean and tree legumes (
Fig. 4E and F
). Besides, the overlap in N-terminal sequences obtained through MALDI-ISD with those sequences obtained through Edman degradation (
Figs. 2C,D
and 
4E,F
), further strengthened the evidences for existance of both RsBBI and RsKI in

In-gel activity staining studies revealed both RsBBI and RsKI are active against bovine pancreatic trypsin (
Fig. 5A
). However, RsBBI but not RsKI is active against chymotrypsin (
Fig. 5B
). RsBBI is bound to its cognate proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin at 1:2 and 3:4 M ratio (
Fig. 5C
) and RsKI is bound to trypsin at 1:2 M ratio (
Fig. 5D
). In general, the PIs from BBI family were double headed while PIs from Kunitz inhibitor family were single headed (

). RsBBI corroborated well with the reported BBIs from leguminous plants in possessing inhibitory domains for trypsin and chymotrypsin. 
<tp:taxon-name>
In silico
</tp:taxon-name>
three-dimensional modelling of RsBBI1 also predicted it as a symmetrical protein with both trypsin and chymotrypsin reactive site loops on opposite sides (

). But, RsBBI neutralized chymotrypsin activity in a unique pattern (3:4 ratio) although 80% of enzyme activity is inhibited at 1:2 M ratio. Also, RsKI differed from most earlier known Kunitz inhibitors in possessing two trypsin inhibitory domains (
Fig. 5A and D
). Occurrence of such double headed Kunitz inhibitors is found to be rare in nature and reported from the following plants earlier: 
<tp:taxon-name>
Leucaena leucocephala

), 
<tp:taxon-name>
Adenanthera pavonina
(
Migliolo et al., 2010

</tp:taxon-name>
, tamarind (

). However, the exact nature of the number of 
TI
/CI reactive sites on RsBBI and RsKI has to be studied in detail as it could also be due to oligomerisation. But, the existence of dual 
TI
sites on BBI and Kunitz inhibitors of plants is not uncommon.
</p>
         <p>
Enzyme inhibition kinetics analysis by Lineweaver-Burk plot revealed that RsBBI and RsKI inhibited the trypsin/chymotrypsin enzymes by non-competitive mode. The 
Ki
of RsBBI and RsKI against trypsin were 128.5 ± 4.5 nM and 172.0 ± 9.2 nM (
Fig. 5E and G
) while the 
Ki
of RsBBI against chymotrypsin was 807.8 ± 23.7 nM (
Fig. 5F

Ki
values at a wide range from &lt;1 nM to 52 μM towards trypsin (

2.6. Biochemical stability of RsBBI and RsKI
</title>
         <p>
There is no remarkable loss in the 
TI
and CI activities of RsBBI on heating up to 100 °C (
Fig. 6A
). Similarly, the 
TI
and CI activities of RsBBI were stable at alkaline pH. However, at less acidic (pH 5.0) or neutral pH (pH 7.0), a decrease (&gt; 40%) in 
TI
activity but not CI activity was observed (
Fig. 6B
). Such a decrease in 
TI
activity was correlated to the precipitation of PIs at their isoelectric pH (
Figs. 2A
and 
4C
; 

). Conversely, RsBBI lost 100% of its 
TI
and CI activities after reduction with 1.0 mM and 3 mM DTT, respectively (
Fig. 6C
). The loss in 
TI
and CI activities of RsBBI on reduction with DTT confirmed the importance of redox-sensitive disulphide bridge network in maintenance of RsBBI structure (

). The effect of temperature, pH and DTT treatment on the 
TI
activity of RsKI was quite different from RsBBI. The 
TI
activity of RsKI is stable up to 70 °C. But, it lost&gt; 80% of its 
TI
activity when incubated at 100 °C (
Fig. 6D
). There was a marginal loss (&lt;10%) in 
TI
activity of RsKI at acidic/ neutral/alkaline pH (
Fig. 6E

TI
activity of RsKI was quite stable to the action of DTT. RsKI lost complete (100%) 
TI
activity when incubated with DTT at a concentration as high as 200 mM (
Fig. 6F

TI
activity of Kunitz inhibitors after reduction with DTT was also reported from

2.7. Secondary structural analysis of RsBBI and RsKI
</title>
         <p>
At far-UV (
190–260 nm
) region, the secondary structural elements existed in the following order in RsBBI: random coils (56%)&gt; β-sheets (21%)&gt; β-turns (18%)&gt; α-helices (5%) while in RsKI, they existed as: random coils (62.9%)&gt; β-turns (23.8%)&gt; β-sheets (7%)&gt; α-helices (6%). Thermal treatment of RsBBI showed only a marginal decrease in its ellipticity when the temperature was raised from 25 to 90 
°
C. But, this effect was reversed on cooling down from 90 to 25 
°
C suggesting RsBBI is stable to heat treatment (
Fig. 7A and B
). Also, the changes observed in mean residue ellipticity of RsBBI at 
203 nm
on increasing the temperature to as high as 90 °C indicate RsBBI is highly stable and resistant to thermal denaturation (Supplementary 
Fig. 7A and B
). BBIs are structurally stable due to its rich network of seven disulphide bridges and β-sheets which prevent the RsBBI from undergoing any changes in their secondary structures even after heating to 90 °C and thereby render the protein to retain both its 
TI
and CI activities (
Figs. 6A
and 
7A,B
). Such structural stability was reported in BBIs from horse gram (

) and black gram (

). Conversely, RsKI is sensitive to thermal treatment and showed a remarkable decrease in its ellipticity when heated at 80 °C (
Fig. 7D
). However, the ellipticity was reversed on cooling down from 90 to 25 °C (
Fig. 7E
). Moreover, the mean residue ellipticity of RsKI at 
199 nm
revealed a sigmoidal curve on increasing temperature which started at 70 °C and ended at 90 °C with a 
Tm
of 75 °C and reversed upon cooling from 90 to 25 °C (Supplementary 
Fig. 7C and D
). Such structural plasticity of Kunitz inhibitors in temperature induced unfolding and refolding was reported from

C. selloi

(

).
</p>
         <p>
Further, any change in pH from 8.0 to 2.0 or 12.0 resulted in a marginal decrease in the ellipticity of RsBBI (
Fig. 7C
). The ellipticity exhibited by RsKI did not vary at pH 4.0 and 6.0 as compared to pH 8.0. But, a marginal increase in the ellipticity of RsKI was observed when incubated at pH 2.0 or 12.0 (
Fig. 7F
). These results suggest that RsBBI is structurally more stable than RsKI at different temperature and pH treatments.

Fig. 8A–G
). In-gel activity staining studies suggest RsBBI and RsKI were active against both AjGPs and HaGPs (
Fig. 8A and B
). Despite the marginal differences showed during in-gel activity staining studies, quantification of the specific activity of both RsBBI and RsKI showed wide difference against AjGPs and HaGPs (
Fig. 8A–C
). The specific activity of RsBBI against trypsin, chymotrypsin, AjGPs and HaGPs are found to be in the following order: AjGPIs (41,666 ± 950 units/mg protein)&gt; 
TI
(1730 ± 120 units/mg protein)&gt; CI (217 ± 25 units/mg protein)&gt; HaGPIs (113 ± 10 units/mg protein). Conversely, the specific activity of RsKI against the respective enzymes were in the following order: HaGPIs (16,950 ± 750 units/mg protein)&gt; 
TI
(807 ± 55 units/mg protein)&gt; AjGPIs (513 ± 45 units/ mg protein). However, no activity was detected for RsKI against chymotrypsin (

In the present study trypsin-specific PIs (RsPI) were purified from the seeds of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. sublobata
</tp:taxon-name>
, a wild relative of pigeonpea using chromatographic techniques. Bowman-Birk isoinhibitors (RsBBI) and Kunitz isoinhibitors (RsKI) present in RsPI are purified to homogeneity by exploiting their differential solubility in TCA and sodium acetate buffer, sequentially. The identity of RsBBI and RsKI was confirmed through Nterminal sequencing by Edman degradation method and mass spectrometry studies. The self-association pattern of RsBBI and RsKI was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting with anti-BBI antibody, MALDI- intact mass and MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis, respectively. The 
TI
and CI activities of RsBBI and RsKI correlated with their structural stability at a wide range of temperature, pH and DTT concentration. Further, 
in vitro
studies against AjGPs and HaGPs suggested the potential of RsBBI and RsKI in the management of
