Cyclotides are an extremely stable class of peptides, ubiquitously distributed in 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of cyclotides in Sri Lankan 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
plants, using combined tools of transcriptomics and mass spectrometry. New cyclotides were discovered for the first time in the wild flora of 
Sri Lanka
, within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
, a plant used in traditional medicine as an antimicrobial. Plant extracts prepared in small scale from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
were first subjected to LC-MS analysis. Subsequent transcriptome 
de novo
sequencing of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
uncovered 25 new (vibe 1–25) and three known (varv 
A
/kalata 
S
, viba 17, viba 11) peptide sequences from M¨obius and bracelet cyclotide subfamilies as well as hybrid cyclotides. Among the transcripts, putative linear acyclotide sequences (vibe 4, vibe 10, vibe 11 and vibe 22) that lack a conserved asparagine or aspartic acid vital for cyclisation were also present. Four asparagine endopeptidases (AEPs), 
Vb
AEP1-4 were found within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola betonicifolia
transcriptome
</tp:taxon-name>
, including a peptide asparaginyl ligase (PAL), potentially involved in cyclotide backbone cyclisation, showing
&gt;
93% sequence homology to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola yedoensis
</tp:taxon-name>
peptide asparaginyl ligases, 
Vy
PALs. In addition, we identified two protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs), 
Vb
PDI1-2, likely involved in cyclotide oxidative folding, having high sequence homology (
&gt;
74%) with previously reported 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
PDIs. The current study highlights the ubiquity of cyclotides in 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
as well as the utility of transcriptomic analysis for cyclotides and their putative processing enzyme discovery. The high variability of cyclotide sequences in terms of loop sizes and residues in 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
showcase the cyclotide structure as an adaptable scaffold as well as their importance as a combinatorial library, implicated in plant defense.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Cyclotides are an exceptionally stable family of gene-encoded plant miniproteins. Their N and 
C
termini are joined by a peptide bond to form a continuous circular backbone, which together with three intertwined disulfide crosslinks, result in their signature cyclic cystine knot (CCK) motif (

) as shown in 
Fig. 1
. Among the plant families investigated so far, cyclotides are found within the families 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rubiaceae (Lorents 
Gran, 1973
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Solanaceae (
Poth et al., 2012
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae (Colgrave et al., 2011)</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cucurbitaceae (
Hernandez et al., 2000
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(G¨oransson et al., 1999; 

). Cyclotides show a diverse range of bioactivities including antimicrobial (

; 

), cytotoxic (

; Sch¨opke et al., 1993), anti-HIV (

, 

), insecticidal (

) and uterotonic activities (Lorents 

; 

). Their ecological role in plants points to host-defense (

; 

). Cyclotides are ribosomally synthesised and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) (Van der Donk., 2013; 

; 

). This allows for their identification by genetic tools, presenting complementing tools for peptide discovery. As shown in 
Fig. 1
, cyclotides grouped into the Mobius ¨subfamily contain a Pro reside in loop 5 usually preceded by a Trp residue, facilitating a 
cis
-Pro bond and resulting in a conceptual 180 
◦
twist in the backbone (

). Cyclotides, lacking this 
cis-
Pro residue, instead having a 
trans
-amide bond at the corresponding position, have a topology that mimics an amino acid bracelet, thus termed bracelet cyclotides - the second subfamily. However, the differentiation of cyclotides goes beyond the 
cis
-Pro conformation, as hybrid cyclotides having loops similar to both Mobius ¨and bracelet groups have also been identified (

). The third subfamily, confined to 
<tp:taxon-name>Cucurbitaceae</tp:taxon-name>
and differentiated by trypsin inhibition, is atypical in sequence and loop size to other cyclotides and is more similar to linear trypsin inhibitor knottins from squash plants (

). Variants of naturally occurring cyclotides with an open backbone were also identified in plants and termed acyclotides (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
consists of 23–31 genera and approximately 1000–1100 species worldwide (

; 

). Most genera contain a small number of species and the three largest genera, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hybanthus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rinorea
</tp:taxon-name>
account for more than 90% of the family. The largest of these three genera is 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola
</tp:taxon-name>
, commonly known as violets, a genus comprising herbs with spurred flowers. The other genera in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family have radially symmetrical flowers and are lianas, shrubs, or either large or small trees (

). Eight species from the 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
are found in 
Sri Lanka
: three from genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rinorea
</tp:taxon-name>
, three from genus 

<tp:taxon-name>Viola</tp:taxon-name>
,

and two from genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hybanthus
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rinorea
species
</tp:taxon-name>
are thought to be extinct in 
Sri Lanka
and endangered plants from the other two 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hybanthus
species
</tp:taxon-name>
are found only in wild forests (Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, 2016) (

).
</p>
         <p>
Cyclotide discovery efforts on 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
outnumber any other plant family and almost every 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
plant screened has shown a positive outcome, either at peptide or genetic level, for the presence of cyclotides (

). To our knowledge, no examples for 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
plants devoid of cyclotides are reported in literature. The number of cyclotide variants among 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
plants is estimated to above 150,000 different sequences, or on average 160 per species (

). Notably, neither cyclotides nor any other secondary metabolites from Sri Lankan 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola
</tp:taxon-name>
plants have been investigated, making them good candidates for discovery of new chemistry. The presence of cyclotides in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
collected in 
Australia
, was hinted in previous studies but their peptide sequences and/or structural information were not probed in detail (

; 

; 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Geographical location and environmental conditions are factors that influence the plant cyclotide profile (

). For example, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola odorata
</tp:taxon-name>
found within 
India
expresses a suite of different cyclotides, depending on its geographical location (

). This is attributed to large variations in environmental factors such as the 
type
of soil, altitude, water, temperature, humidity, sunlight and related stress factors associated with geographical location (

). Thus, it was also of interest to investigate the cyclotide expression at transcriptome and peptide level within 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
originating from 
Sri Lanka
.
</p>
         <p>
Water extract or decoction of whole herb or part of the plant such as the flowers of 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
is used by local people and tribes in 
India
and 
Pakistan
in traditional medicine as a diuretic and to treat blood disorders, as well as for a variety of therapeutic conditions including nervous system diseases like epilepsy, cough, pneumonia, pharyngitis and boils (

; 

; 

). This traditional practice also motivated the current study because cyclotides were speculated as a prime group of candidate molecules responsible for the plant’ s bioactivities. This was supported by the pre-existing knowledge that cyclotides commonly occur within 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
and are naturally endowed with a wide variety of inherent bioactivities (Srivastava et al., 2020).
</p>
         <p>
Herein we discovered a new set of cyclotides and acyclotides in 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
using transcriptomic analysis, small scale peptide extraction and mass spectrometric analysis. The sequence diversity of new cyclotides indicate their high bioactive potential. The precursor sequences of cylotides give further insight into potential processing sites accessible to processing enzymes during cyclotide maturation. The transcriptome also formed the basis for identifying a putative enzyme 
Vb
AEP1 that could presumably be involved in cyclotide biosynthesis. Our results highlight that combination of techniques, using transcriptomic and peptidomic tools can guide and accelerate cyclotide discovery.

2.1. Identification of novel cyclotide sequences in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Viola betonicifolia</tp:taxon-name>
transcriptome
</title>
         <p>
A
high-quality transcriptome assembly is a prerequisite for studying biosynthesis and regulation of specialised plant metabolites. To capture active transcripts of 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
, cDNA libraries were prepared from the combined tissues obtained from leaves, stems, seeds and roots. RNAsequencing was performed using an Illumina Hi-Seq 3000 platform. Summary of detailed information on the 
de novo
transcriptome assembly for 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
is given in Supplementary 
Table S1.
</p>
         <p>
A total of 28 cyclotide precursor sequences were prepared as DNA sequences for the sequence alignment (
Fig. 2
, Supplementary Data 
S
1), comprising selected domains of the precursor, 
i.e.
, N-terminal propeptide (NTPP), N-terminal repeat (NTR), and mature cyclotide domains. To guide the alignment of DNA sequences of the precursors, they were translated into protein sequences and aligned independently for each precursor domains using ClustalX in Ugene software package. The resulting protein-guided alignment of nucleotide sequences was then subjected to manual adjustments within reading frames or precursor domains.
</p>
         <p>
Analysis of precursor sequences and putative processing sites provided further insight into cyclotide biosynthesis in 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
and assisted to distinguish cyclotides from other cysteine-rich plant proteins. 
A
total of 25 new peptide sequences (vibe 1–25) and three known sequences (viba 11, viba 17, and varv 
A
/kalata 
S
) were identified from transcriptomic analysis (
Table 1
). New cyclotides (vibe 1–25) were named according to the nomenclature proposed by 

, with the plant binomial name followed by the number indicating the order (vibe for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
).
</p>
         <p>
As highlighted in 
Table 1
, these 25 new cyclotides/acyclotides were detected in 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
transcriptome and 12 of them were only found as transcripts but not at peptide level. Two cleavage events, one at the N-terminal and the other at the C-terminal in the cyclotide precursors, lead to the formation of a linear peptide that is subsequently ligated to 
<tp:taxon-name>form the</tp:taxon-name>
head-to-tail cyclized backbone. In demarcating loop 6 where potential cyclisation occurs, we propose that the vibe precursors are most likely cleaved after an Asn/Asp residue at the C-terminal processing site and N-terminal of a Gly residue, at the N-terminal processing site. This notion was esablished based on cyclotide precursors identified in previous studies to date (

), Based on these most probable cleavage sites, the expected mature vibe cyclotide masses were calculated and compared with observed peptide masses (
Table 1
). Based on the presence or absence of the Pro residue in loop 5, members of both M¨obius and bracelet cyclotides were found at transcriptome level. Some cyclotides are hybrids between the two subfamilies (vibe 18–19, vibe 23–24), in particular they have a loop 3 more aligned with typical M¨obius-type. Vibe 22 likewise lacks the 
cis
-Pro but its loops lack similarity with either subfamily besides carrying the conserved PG dipeptide sequence in loop 3 (Mobius ¨characteristic), together making it a distinct hybrid cyclotide.
</p>
         <p>
All mature cyclotide products begin with a Gly residue at the Nterminal except vibe 16 that contains an Ala at the corresponding position (
Fig. 2
and 
Table 1
). This indicates that either a Gly or Ala at Nterminal are capable of undergoing a transpeptidase reaction with the conserved Asn/Asp at C-terminal during cyclisation. In 21 of the new vibe precursor sequences identified, an Asn or Asp occupies the C-terminus of the cyclotide domain which is followed by a highly conserved SL and rarely AL or SI dipeptide sequence. As it is known that the conserved Asn/Asp facilitates head-to-tail cyclisation, these vibe sequences were identified as ‘cyclotides’. In contrast, four of the precursors differ significantly in the C-terminal processing sites and were identified as acyclotides (vibe 4, vibe 10, vibe 11, vibe 22) (
Table 1
, 
Fig. 2
, supplementary Data 
S
1). Vibe 4 and 11 precursor sequences terminate at a C-terminal Asn and Asp residue, respectively, due to a stop codon. However, despite the presence the Asn and Asp critical for cyclisation, the absence of the 
C
terminal signal peptide, prevents the cyclotide precursor affinity for the putative cyclizing enzyme (

; 

). Vibe 10 and 22 likewise contain stop codons in their mature cyclotide domain and lack the conserved Asn/Asp residue, vital for cyclisation. In previous reports, the occurrence of acyclotides is infrequently reported for species of the

Analysis of cyclotide precursors identified so far reveals that the specific tail sequence of the cyclotide precursor protein, recognized by the cyclisation enzyme, starts with a sequence of two amino acids, GL/SL in 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(

and HV in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Fabaceae (
Nguyen et al., 2011
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. In vibe precursors, we also observe an SI combination of residues in the C-terminal propeptide sequence (vibe 19). Thus, the prerequisites for cyclisation in vibes is most likely the conserved Asn/Asp at the 
S
1 binding site, followed by the presence of a residue with a small side chain (G, 
S
, 
A
or H), and subsequently followed by a hydrophobic residue (L, I or V) in the C-terminal recognition sequence.
</p>
         <p>
To investigate the plasticity of vibe cylotides, we analysed them in detail, loop by loop. Cyclotide loop 1 is reported to contain a highly conserved GES/GET triad (

). However, among the new sequences identified, loop 1 is occupied by AET (vibe 9) and FET (vibe 11) sequences. Notably, positively charged residues, Lys in vibe 16 (GKT) and Arg in vibe 20 (RES) in loop 1 are present. Another peculiarity is observed in two sequences; vibe 16 (GKT in loop1) and vibe 22 (SGS in loop1) lack the conserved E, that is typically present in loop 1. In previous studies, the conserved Glu in loop 1 of cyclotides was shown to be important for overall structural stability as well as bioactivity. In cycloviolacin O2, methylation of the Glu or substitution with Ala abolishes the membrane disrupting activity that is characteristic of the family (G¨oransson et al., 2009). Wang et al. also showed that in kalata B12 which has an Asp in place of Glu in loop 1, the overall cyclotide fold is maintained, but due to a weaker H bond network, the three-dimensional structure is more flexible. Kalata B12 is devoid of the prototypical hemolytic activity of cyclotides and the structure is less resistant to treatment with acids (

). Cyclotide sequences where Glu in loop 1 is substituted with Ser or Gly have also been also observed at transcript level in 
<tp:taxon-name>

of

1 in
cyclotide caripe 4 and caripe 6 respectively, but the impact on biological activity due to the absence of Glu has not been studied in detail (

).

         <p>
Loop 2 of bracelet cyclotides appear rather conserved in 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
with VX (I/L)P (X =W, F, Y) residue pattern except, vibe 9 (LWGT), 10 (AYAP) and 12 (IIRP). In comparison, loop 2 of M¨obius vibe cyclotides is much more variable. In particular, the presence of Glyrich sequences (VGGT, VGGS, FGGI) and Lys-rich sequences (VKLK, HKTK) are apparent. Vibe 15, which contains five Lys with a net charge of +4 projected as the most basic peptide of all vibe cyclotide (
Fig. 4
). Loop 2 and 5 of vibe 15 and vibe 20 are markedly very similar to corresponding loops of previously reported lysine-rich cyclotides - cycloviolacin O14

</tp:taxon-name>
and globa E from

(

).
</p>
         <p>
Loop 3 of vibe cyclotides shows similar features as previously described cyclotides (

). M¨obius subfamily cyclotides typically comprise four residues in their loop 3. Bracelet cyclotides, on the other hand, show greater diversity in sequence and size (four to six residues) in this loop. Both subfamilies possess a highly conserved Gly residue in the last position of loop 3 for most sequences. However, some exceptions are observed in vibe cyclotides: vibe 10, 19, 21, 23 and 25 sequences lack a Gly as the last residue in loop 3. The unusual vibe 22 contains only three residues its loop 3 (PPG), which likely affects the conformation of this loop significantly. Vibe 12 consists of 7 residues in loop 3, which is the longest loop 3 among all cyclotides identified in 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
To identify unique features, we compared vibe cyclotides identified herein with the cyclotides reported in cybase, a database for all reported cyclotides and acyclotides (

) (www.cybase.org.au). Loop 4, the smallest of all loops, contains only a single residue, Ser or Thr in majority of the vibe cyclotides. This is in line with other cyclotides reported to date. However, variable residues are observed in loop 4, including Lys, Arg, Val, Gly, Tyr, Ile, which is unusual. In general, 5–8 residues are typically present in cyclotide loop 6. Some exceptions are reported, such as vitri peptide 24a, vitri peptide 36 and Tricylon where up to ten residues in loop 6 have been noted (

). Along similar lines, vibe 7 appears to contain the longest loop 6 comprising of nine residues.

2.1.1. Small scale LC-MS screening of cyclotides in

Previously,

was described as a cyclotide containing species using LC-MS (

). However, cyclotide sequences from 
<tp:taxon-name>

have not been previously reported. In our search to identify these molecules, we first used LC-MS to detect cyclotide masses at peptide level. LC-MS analysis identified peaks in the range of 2.8–3.4 kDa for (M+1) 
1+
, characteristic of potential cyclotides in crude 
<tp:taxon-name>

extract as shown in 
Fig. 3
and Supplementary Table 
S
2. Of 25 transcripts apparent in the transcriptome, 13 cyclotide candidate masses were observed by LC-MS (
Table 1
, 
Fig. 3
). These include cyclotides, vibe 3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, viba 11, viba 17 and varv 
A
/kalata 
S
. Some of the most abundant cyclotide-like masses in the extract were partially purified by RP-HPLC and subjected a reduction/alkylation procedure (

). The presence of six cysteines was confirmed by a mass increase of 348 Da for each cyclotide candidate (6 × 58 Da), following the reduction of the six cysteines and their 

S

-carbamidomethylation (
Fig. 3
, Supplementary 
Figure S1
and Supplementary Table 
S
3). Upon opening of the cyclic backbone by endoproteinase GluC, due to cleavage after a single conserved Glu present in most cyclotides, the (M+1) 
1+
mass further increased by 18 Da (
Fig. 3
, Supplementary Table 
S
4). However, due to limited plant material at hand, vibe cyclotides were not fully sequenced using MSMS, thus the masses identified are ‘candidate cyclotides’ in 
<tp:taxon-name>

that matched in mass with the

         <p>
Of vibe cyclotides identified, vibe 12 stands out as the most hydrophobic and positively-charged cyclotide with a calculated hydropathicity index of 1.1 (hydrophobicity 43.3%) and a net charge of 1.7 at pH 7 as shown in 
Fig. 4
. In both cationicity and hydrophobicity, vibe 12 appears to be superior to well-characterised membrane disrupting cyclotide, cycloviolacin O2 (Stromstedt ¨et al., 2017). In contrast, vibe 25 is the most hydrophilic and acidic sequence with hydropathicity index of 0.72 (hydrophobicity 16.7%) and net charge of 2.2 at pH 7. Aside from vibe 25, several prominent acidic sequences including vibe 11, vibe 18 and vibe 23 were also identified. Among the other cyclotides identified, vibe 17 and 11 are at two extremes with regard to their physiochemical properties - vibe 17, a positively charged but extremely hydrophilic cyclotide and vibe 11, an acidic but extremely hydrophobic cyclotide.

The presence of varv 
A
/kalata 
S
in 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
validates the previous observations that it is a cyclotide hosted in many plant species with a high tendency to be expressed in 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
. Some of the transcripts were absent at peptide level, presumably due to production as minor components or because these peptides were not expressed in the plant. On the contrary, several cyclotide masses were observed at peptide level (
Fig. 3
, Supplementary 
Figure S1
), however their corresponding transcripts were absent, similar to what has been observed in other cyclotide discovery work (

; 

). This discrepancy can occur due to several reasons. The sample for transcriptomic analysis was not collected at the same time as the sample used for peptide analysis, in fact a quality RNA sample suitable for analysis from 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
was only obtained after our fourth attempt. Thus, the physiological and seasonal conditions may have affected the cyclotide expression. This also highlights that the full repertoire of cyclotides produced by the plants can be detected only by a combination of methods and cannot be restricted to one point in time. It is also a reminder that analysis at peptide level is irreplaceable by transcriptomic tools applied in discovery. Full genome sequencing is the only means to get the complete picture of the full repertoire of cyclotides that a plant species can potentially make. However, techniques including transcriptomic and MS analyses have the advantage of highlighting those cyclotides that are expressed and functionally important to the plant.
</p>
         <p>
Aside from the three known cyclotides, all 25 cyclotides identified in 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
are new. In line with the previous observation that less than ~1/3 of the known cyclotides occur in multiple plants (

), most of the cyclotides either expressed in the transcriptome or peptide level in 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
currently appear unique. The presence of a suite of cyclotides varying in loop size, sequence, net charge and hydrophobicity in 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
, would be valuable in countering emerging resistance in plant pests and pathogens and supports the natural defense role of cyclotides (

). It is known that cytotoxicity of cyclotides derives from their ability to disrupt lipid bilayers where residues of their surface ‘bioactive patch’ bind to phospholipid head groups and insert into the lipid bilayers via a hydrophobic patch (

). Thus, a mixture of cyclotides that are rich in cationic residues as well hydrophobicity would be favorable in targeting different 
types
of organisms, organelles or cell membranes, associated with different insect herbivores and pathogens. 
A
receptor modulated mechanism for cyclotides, involving G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), possibly linked to insects or more generally invertebrate neuropeptide receptors, affecting invertebrate development, reproductive behavior and water homeostasis has also been proposed (

; 

). Whether different cyclotides play a complementing role by supporting each other in their defense is yet to be shown. Among the transcripts of vibe cyclotides, highly cationic peptides that are ideally suited to interact with the negatively charged bacterial and fungal membranes are present. Bacterial infections potentially underpin some of the traditional medicinal indications of 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
, such as pneumonia, boils and cough (

), thus drawing a connection to cyclotides as potential drug candidates in the herbal extracts seems like a plausible choice that requires validation by bioactivity studies.

BLAST search in the

transcriptome for AEP enzymes similar to verified cyclizing enzymes from cyclic peptide bearing plants yielded four main hits (Supplementary Table 
S
5). The sequences of the enzyme catalytic region were aligned and a similarity grid was generated (
Fig. 5
). If the vibe enzymes show high sequence similarity to well-characterised ligases identified in other cyclotide bearing species, and more importantly in other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, we speculated that those enzymes will have high likelihood to be potential ligases involved in vibe cyclotide processing. First of the AEPs identified, 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
AEP

1 (VbAEP1) showed 95% and 93% sequence similarity to 
Vy
PAL1 and

V. yedoensis
</tp:taxon-name>
respectively, two verified ligases with high 
in vitro
backbone cyclisation efficiency at pH 5–8 (

) (Supplementary Table 
S
2). Several ‘ligase activity determining’ regions are proposed for AEPs from cyclotide bearing plants to distinguish whether the enzymes are predominantly potential proteases or ligases. As shown in 
Fig. 5
, these regions include, marker of ligase region (MLA), ligase activity determinants 1 and 2 (LAD1 and LAD2), ‘gate keeper’ residue within LAD1 and poly-proline region. 
Vb
AEP1 has a 
i)
‘Ile’ as the gate keeper residue within LAD1, 
ii)
‘AP’ dipeptide sequence in LAD2 and an 
iii)
truncated MLA region, features indicative of a potential ligase (

; 

). Because the latter regions correspond well with ‘ligase-type’ determinants identified previously for 
Vy
PAL2 (

), we propose that 
Vb
AEP1 is most likely involved in vibe cyclotide backbone cyclisation.
</p>
         <p>
The second enzyme, 
Vb
AEP2 most closely matched 
Vy
PAL3 (with 89% sequence homology), a ligase with low catalytic efficiency identified in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola yedoensis
(
Hemu et al., 2019

</tp:taxon-name>
. 
A
bulky residue such as Tyr as the first residue in ‘YP’ dipeptide within LAD2 has been shown to contribute to protease activity and concurrent low ligase efficiency of 
Vy
PAL3 (

). Despite the presence of ligase favorable residues - 
i)
‘Val’ as the gate keeper residue within LAD1 and 
ii)
a truncated MLA region, 
Vb
AEP2 also contains Tyr as the first residue within ‘YP’ dipeptide sequence in LAD2 similar to 
Vy
PAL3, skewing it more towards a ligase with low catalytic efficiency. Notably, 
Vb
AEP2 also has a truncated poly-proline region different from what is observed in previously established plant proteases and ligases (
Fig. 5
).
</p>
         <p>
Vb
AEP3 and 
Vb
AEP4 show high sequence homology (
&gt;
98%) to more protease-type 
Vy
AEP2 and 
Vy
AEP3 identified in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola yedoensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(Supplementary Table 
S
5). In 
Vb
AEP3 and 
Vb
AEP4, the gate keeper residue is ‘Gly’ in LAD1 and ‘GP’ dipeptide sequence is found within LAD2. In addition, an untruncated MLA region is present. These features correspond well with verified protease-type AEPs (
Fig. 5
). It must be noted that our proposal for the vibe AEPs to be either ligase or protease-type are subject to subsequent isolation or expression of the enzymes to facilitate concluding functional studies. Based on proposed ligase predictive residues, 
Mco
AEP2 appears to be a protease, but, functional studies have demonstrated to the contrary, that it is in fact a ligase (

). This indicates the presence of sequence elements and interactions other than known ligase determinants, such as substrate affinity that potentially influence an enzyme’ s function (

). In addition, factors such as favorable pH may alter the behavior of an AEP to display either ligase or protease activity. For example, 
Vy
AEP1 identified in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola yedoensis
(
Hemu et al., 2019

, act as hydrolases at low pH, but their ligase activity becomes prominent at neutral/high pH. Although in the current context of the study, the functional roles of 
Vb
AEPs were not evaluated, their discovery is important and add to the growing number of AEPs identified in cyclotide bearing plants. Under the conditions 
Vb
AEPs act as ligase or proteases, whether they are involved in cyclotide biosynthesis and whether they have potential biotechnological use still remains to be shown in future studies.
</p>

Transcriptomic analysis is practical in the context of studying endangered plant species when access to large-scale plant material is not feasible. The cost of transcriptomic analysis has also significantly reduced in the past decade making this technique affordable and accessible. Another technical advantage of transcriptomic analysis is, it removes the ambiguity of isobaric residues, Ile and Leu in the translated peptide sequences, which is usually not distinguishable in peptide sequencing approaches based on MS/MS. 
A
future development from this work will be to synthesise selected cyclotides identified in the transcriptome for bioactivity screening studies. In addition, studies aimed at investigating the functional role of potential cyclisation enzyme identified in the transcriptome, will be useful to gain insight into the cyclotide biogenesis in 
<tp:taxon-name>

. We encountered many difficulties with obtaining quality RNA due to problems associated with storage and transportation of the material under heat stable conditions.

3. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
This work highlights that transcriptomic analysis, in combination with analysis at peptide level, is an efficient and powerful tool to accelerate the rate of new cyclotide discovery. Using this method, 21 new cyclotides, four new acyclotides and three known cyclotide sequences (varv 
A
/kalata 
S
, viba 17, viba 11) were discovered from 
<tp:taxon-name>
V. betonicifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
. The presence of cyclotides in 
<tp:taxon-name>Viola species</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Sri Lanka
supports the notion of ubiquitous occurrence of cyclotides in 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
. Discovery of new AEPs with presumably ligase activity are important for potential biotechnological applications ranging from 
in vitro
peptide engineering to plant molecular farming. These AEP enzymes, in combination with PDI enzymes and vibe cyclotide precursor sequences are important tools to gain insight into how cyclotides are potentially processed from linear precursors. The novel cyclotide sequences identified in the current study validates that 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
is a rich source of diverse cyclotides, fortifying the plasticity of the scaffold and possible sequence variability that can be accommodated within the cyclotide scaffold.

Whole RNA extraction, sequencing and analysis were performed according to the method described in the literature (

). The plant tissues were pooled from all of the plant’ s major organs, 
i.e.
, the roots, stems, flowers, and leaves. The collected tissues were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen and powdered using an autoclaved mortar and pestle. For RNA isolation, a small plant piece was stored in RNA later solution (Ambion, Thermo fisher) at 20 
◦
C. The sequencing was performed by an external service provider (Macrogen Inc., 
Seoul
, 
South Korea
). The tissues were directly extracted by RNeasy Plant 
<tp:taxon-name>Mini Kit</tp:taxon-name>

) according to the manufacturers’ protocols. Quality and quantity of RNA were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, 
USA
) with an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) and rRNA ratio. The cDNA library was prepared using a TruSeq preparation kit according to the manufacturer’ s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, 
U.S.

The assembled transcriptome was searched for sequences similar to cyclotides from Cybase (cut-off date: 
March 03, 2020
; http://www. cybase.org.au/) (

) by the standalone NCBI-blast + service (tblastn, E-value cutoff: 20) in the Ugene software package (v.1.31.0) (

). An additional search was done using a motif search (

) in Fuzzpro application of EMBOSS (v. 5.0.0) (

). Sequences containing cyclotides were extracted and the result file was further processed by manual inspection after ClustalX alignment. The sequence was assumed to be a cyclotide precursor if the sequence contained the six conserved cysteines aligned with previously known cyclotides, and if the conserved N-terminal domain showed sequence similarity to known cyclotide precursors.

</title>
         <p>
A
total of 28 precursor sequences were prepared as DNA sequence for the sequence alignment, and the sequences included only three domains of the precursor, i.e., NTPP, NTR, and cyclotide domains. To guide the alignment of DNA sequences of the precursors, they were translated into protein sequences and aligned independently for each molecular species using ClustalW in the Ugene software package. Those alignments were in turn combined and realigned (
i.e.
, keeping the indel positions from the alignment of each of the molecular species). The resulting protein-guided alignment of nucleotide sequences was manually adjusted within reading frames.
