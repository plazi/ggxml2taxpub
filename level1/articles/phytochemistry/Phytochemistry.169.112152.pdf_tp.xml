The CYP74 family of cytochromes P450 includes four fatty acid hydroperoxide metabolizing enzymes: allene oxide synthase (
AOS
), hydroperoxide lyase (
HPL
), divinyl ether synthase, and epoxyalcohol synthase (
EAS
). All P450s have six substrate recognition sites (SRSs) in their structures. Some CYP74 mutations in SRSs leading to their interconversions including substitutions in “ 
F
/ 
L
toggle” (SRS-1 region) were reported before. For further elucidation of the role of this site in CYP74 catalysis, the effect of Phe/Leu mutation on the specificity of selected AOSs was studied in the present work. Mutant forms of ZmAOS1 (CYP74A19, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Zea mays
</tp:taxon-name>
), LeAOS3 (CYP74 
C
3, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lycopersicon esculentum
</tp:taxon-name>
), and PpAOS2 (CYP74A8, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Physcomitrella patens
</tp:taxon-name>
) acquired partial 
EAS
activity. Mutant forms of ZmAOS1 and PpAOS2 possessed additional 
HPL
activities. The results validate the significance of the “ 
F
/ 
L
toggle” as a catalytic determinant of CYP74s, as well as the importance of the conserved Phe at this site for the 
AOS
catalysis.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Cytochromes P450 are the haem-thiolate enzymes involved in numerous biosynthetic and xenobiotic pathways found in all organisms except obligate anaerobes (

; 

). Majority of cytochromes P450 are monooxygenases (classical P450s). These enzymes oxidising the hydrophobic molecules use the dioxygen molecule as a second substrate and interact with the electron transfer chains (

; 

; 

; 

; 

). In contrast, the nonclassical P450s, converting the peroxides of hydrophobic compounds, are independent of dioxygen and electron carriers. These are, for instance, the prostacyclin (PGI 
2
) and thromboxane (TXA 
2
) synthases of mammals and other metazoans (

) and CYP74 clan proteins of plants, some non-mammals, algae and proteobacteria (

). The CYP74 enzymes control the isomerisation or dehydration of fatty acid hydroperoxides to various bioactive oxylipins. Four 
types
of CYP74 clan enzymes are currently known, namely two dehydrases, allene oxide synthase (
AOS
) and divinyl ether synthase (
DES
), and two isomerases, hydroperoxide lyase (
HPL
, synonym: hemiacetal synthase (

)) and epoxyalcohol synthase (
EAS
).
</p>
         <p>
Several catalytically significant regions called the substrate recognition sites (SRSs) have been uncovered within the P450 primary structure (

; 

; 

). Some of them constitute the walls of the catalytic cavity, for instance, the I-helix (

; 

; 

). Furthermore, the experiments on site-directed mutagenesis revealed some primary determinants within the SRSs, which govern the 
type
of catalysis (

; 

; 

; 

; 

, 

, 

). One of these determinants, namely the Phe 137, was uncovered from the 3D-structure of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Arabidopsis thaliana
</tp:taxon-name>
AOS (AtAOS, CYP74A1) (

). This site is localised at the distal face of haem iron. Phe residue as this site in 
AOS
sequences controls reactivity of epoxyallylic radical and its cation by reaction with an aromatic π- system (

). The 
F
137L mutant form of AtAOS exhibited mainly the 
HPL
activity (as well as the minor 
AOS
activity) in contrast to the WT enzyme (

). All studied AOSs have the conserved Phe residue at this site (referred to as “ 
F
/ 
L
toggle” (

)), while all HPLs and DESs have the Leu residue. The Leu/ Phe mutations at this site of selected CYP74 
C
HPLs led to a higher proportion of 
AOS
activity compared to the WT enzymes (

). For further elucidation of role of this putative determinant of kind of CYP74 enzymes catalysis, the effect of Phe/Leu mutations at “ 
F
/ 
L
toggle” on the specificity of selected AOSs (CYP74A and CYP74 
C
subfamilies) has been studied in the present work.

(CYP74A8; GenBank XP_024372097.1) genes consisted of 1608 and 1425 nucleotides, respectively, and encoded 536 and 475 amino acid polypeptides, respectively. The ORFs have been cloned into the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET-23a vector (Novagen, 
USA
) using primer pairs LuAOScF/LuAOScR and PpAOS2cF/ PpAOS2cR (
Table 1
), respectively, to yield the recombinant target proteins with His-tags at C-termini.

2.2. Analysis of reaction products of the WT enzymes
</title>
         <p>
The WT enzymes, as well as their mutant forms, were incubated with fatty acid hydroperoxides. The NaBH 
4
-reduced (as well as the non-reduced) products (Me/ 
TMS
) of incubations were analysed by GC-MS. The structural formulae of the identified products of target WT AOSs and their mutant forms are presented at 
Fig. 2
. All studied WT AOSs specifically produced the α- ketols (allene oxide hydrolysis products), which were identified as Me/ 
TMS
derivatives by GC-MS. Respectively, the NaBH 
4
-reduced products of the WT AOSs were represented predominantly by the nearly equal pairs of 
threo
and 
erythro vic
-diols (see the NaBH 
4
-reduced products of WT LeAOS3 and its 
F
108 
<tp:taxon-name>L mutant</tp:taxon-name>
form as the examples, 
Fig. 3
). For instance, the 9(

S

)- 
HPOD
conversion by LeAOS3 afforded the α- ketol (12 
Z
)-9-hydroxy-10-oxo-12-octadecenoic acid (

), which upon the NaBH 
4
reduction has been converted to the diastereomeric pair of 9,10-diols

4
reduced derivative of which registered in GC-MS was compound 
3
, the cyclopentanol 10-hydroxyphytonoic acid (Me/ 
TMS
). This product appeared as the diastereomeric pair of peaks with the retention time ca. 15.0 min (
Fig. 3A
). Additionally, the WT LeAOS3 produced a trace amount of 9-oxononanoic acid – 9- 
HPL
product (

).

as

241 corresponded to secondary alcohol (

E
)-9-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-10-octadecenoic acid (Me/ТМS) (

) – epoxyalcohol oxiranyl vinyl carbinol (also 
EAS
product). Catalytic hydrogenation converted products 
10a-10c
into a saturated analogue, the mass spectrum of which approved the structures of 9- hydroxy-12,13-epoxyoctadecanoic acid (Me/

. Thus, LeAOS3

incubating with 13(

to produce any α− ketol upon incubations with 9(

. Compound

9-hydroperoxides was EAS activity. Besides, little amounts of compound

The WT ZmAOS1 behaved as the specific AOS and produced the corresponding α− ketols (
Figs. 4A

Fig. S1
, Supplementary 
Fig. S2
). These α− ketols turned into the pairs of corresponding diastereomeric

3. Discussion
</title>
         <p>
Some primary determinants of catalysis by CYP74 enzymes have been revealed previously (

; 

, 

, 

). Substitution of the conserved amino acids at these sites might change the 
type
of catalysis. One of these catalytic determinants, the “ 
F
/ 
L
toggle” (SRS-1), was uncovered thanks to the X-ray 3D-structural analysis of 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. thaliana
AOS
</tp:taxon-name>
(AtAOS, CYP74A1) (

). Importance of this site was confirmed by the conversion of the 
AOS
to 
HPL
activity upon Phe to Leu substitution by site-directed mutagenesis (

). Nonetheless, the attempts of the Authors of work (

) to make a reverse conversion by the Leu to Phe mutation at this site of 
HPL
have failed (personal communication). The results of the present work provide new evidence for the catalytic significance of the “ 
F
/ 
L
toggle” (SRS-1) for the catalysis of CYP74 enzymes.
</p>
         <p>
To reveal the significance of the 
F
/ 
L
toggle for allene oxide synthase catalysis, the mutant forms LeAOS3 
F
108 
L
, ZmAOS1 
F
95 
L
, LuAOS 
F
155 
L
, and PpAOS2 
F
93 
L
were obtained and their catalytic specificities were examined. In contrast to the WT enzymes, which behaved as the specific AOSs, most of these mutant forms exhibited altered catalysis.
</p>
         <p>
The mutant forms LeAOS3 
F
108 
L
, ZmAOS1 
F
95 
L
, and PpAOS2 
F
93 
L
possessed the altered product specificities and converted the substrates, (9(

S

)- 
HPOD
, 9(

S

)- 
HPOT
, 13(

S

)- 
HPOD
, and 13(

S

)- 
HPOT
), into the epoxyalcohols (the 
EAS
products) along with α- ketols (
Figs. 3–5
and Supplementary 
Figs. S1–S
2
). For instance, the LeAOS3 
F
108 
<tp:taxon-name>L mutant form exhibited</tp:taxon-name>
the dual 
AOS
/ 
EAS
activity possessing mainly 
AOS
activity (87.3%) towards preferred substrate – 9(

S

)- 
HPOD
and mainly 
EAS
activity (77.5%) towards non-preferred substrate – 13(

S

)- 
HPOD
. Furthermore, some mutant forms possessed also the 
HPL
activity. The ZmAOS1 
F
95 
<tp:taxon-name>L mutant form possessed</tp:taxon-name>
mainly the 
AOS
or 
HPL
activities being incubated with 9(

S

)- 
HPOD
/T (53.8% and 59.4%, respectively) or 13(

S

)- 
HPOD
/T (47.0% and 58.6%, respectively). The 
EAS
activity of this 
<tp:taxon-name>mutant form was</tp:taxon-name>
minor towards all examined hydroperoxides. The PpAOS2 
F
93 
<tp:taxon-name>L mutant form possessed</tp:taxon-name>
almost only 
EAS
activity towards 9-hydroperoxides, while as 
HPL
(43.2%) or 
AOS
(58.6%) activities towards 13(

S

)- 
HPOD
and 13(

S

)- 
HPOT
, respectively. In contrast to other studied enzymes, the LuAOS 
F
155 
<tp:taxon-name>L mutant form kept</tp:taxon-name>
the unaltered 
AOS
activity.
</p>
         <p>
The results of the present work confirmed the importance of the “ 
F
/ 
L
toggle” as the determinant of CYP74 catalysis. At the same time, the above-described data showed that the Phe to Leu replacement at this site of different AOSs does not necessarily lead to a creation of 
HPL
activity. One of the studied enzymes, the LuAOS (CYP74A1) retained the 
AOS
activity upon the 
F
155 
L
mutation. In contrast, the Phe/Leu mutant forms of three other AOSs, ZmAOS1, LeAOS3 and PpAOS2, possessed the significant changes of catalysis. The LeAOS3 
F
108 
L
mutation resulted in partial 
AOS
to 
EAS
conversion. In turn, the ZmAOS1 
F
95 
<tp:taxon-name>L mutant form acquired</tp:taxon-name>
the partial 
HPL
activity. Finally, the PpAOS2 
F
93 
<tp:taxon-name>L mutant form possessed</tp:taxon-name>
the altered catalysis and behaved largely as the 
EAS
toward the 9-hydroperoxides and 
HPL
toward the 13- 
HPOD
. Moreover, 9- 
HPOD
and 9- 
HPOT
conversions by the 
EAS
activity of the PpAOS2 
F
93 
<tp:taxon-name>L mutant form resulted</tp:taxon-name>
in formation of oxiranyl vinyl carbinols as main products, whereas normally EASs produce mainly oxiranyl carbinols (

; 

, b, 2018a, b, 2019).
</p>
         <p>
Conversions of AOSs to HPLs by site-directed mutagenesis at several sites (including the SRS-1 (

), the I-helix groove (

), and the ERR triad (

)) have been described earlier. The results of the present work show that the same mutation causing the nearly complete 
AOS

HPL
conversion with some enzymes does not necessarily lead to identical conversions in case of different proteins. Moreover, the same mutation may exceptionally have no consequences in the case of some proteins.
</p>
         <p>
The present report described partial 
AOS
into 
EAS
conversion upon the site-directed mutagenesis. Some conversions of CYP74 enzymes catalysis caused by the site-directed mutagenesis, namely the 
AOS
to 
HPL
conversions (

; 

, 

), 
DES
to 
AOS
(

) and double function 
HPL
/ 
EAS
(CYP74 
C
) to 
AOS
(

), have been described before. It is noteworthy in this connection that some plant AOSs produce the epoxyalcohols as the minor side products (

,b). All these data demonstrate the versatility of CYP74 catalysis, capability of CYP74 enzymes to undergo interconversions. The 
18
O
2
labelling experiments with 
AOS
(

), 
DES
(

), 
HPL
(

; 

) and 
EAS
(

, b) showed the rearrangement mechanism proceeding via the epoxyallylic radical, which is a general intermediate of all CYP74 enzymes (
Fig. 6
). Final transformations of the epoxyallylic radical occur either via a loss of a proton (
AOS
, 
DES
), or the recombination of the epoxyallylic radical (
EAS
), or the vinyloxycarbinyl radical (
HPL
) with hydroxyl radical (
Fig. 6
). Thus, four distinct 
types
of catalytic activity are controlled by CYP74 enzymes, which are structurally and phylogenetically related. Their kinship creates the prerequisites for the conversion of the 
type
of catalysis by the site-directed mutagenesis.

Simultaneously, the medium was supplied with 5-aminolevulinic acid to facilitate the haem formation. Inductions were controlled by the 12% SDS-PAGE analysis of crude cellular extracts. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 4500 rpm at 4 ̊ 
C
and lysed with BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen, 
USA
). Purification of His-tagged recombinant proteins was performed using Bio-Scale 
<tp:taxon-name>Mini Profinity IMAC</tp:taxon-name>
cartridge in BioLogic LP chromatographic system (Bio-Rad, 
USA
). The recombinant enzymes were eluted from the cartridge using 50 mM histidine. The recombinant protein concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT™ Protein HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, 
USA
). The haemoprotein concentrations were estimated using the pyridine haemochromogen assay (

). The relative purity of recombinant proteins was estimated by SDS-PAGE and staining of the gel with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. Enzymatic activities of the purified recombinant enzymes were determined by monitoring the decrease of the signal at
