There are about 200 holoparasitic broomrapes (
<tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) known worldwide, however, only several species have been so far investigated phytochemically. Among 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
s.l.
are both rare and endangered species, as well as onerous crop pests. This study aims to give a phytochemical description, both qualitative and quantitative, of six broomrape species (
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche
</tp:taxon-name>
taxa) growing in 
Poland
, including species that have not been tested in detail (
<tp:taxon-name>
O. caryophyllacea
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. lutea
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. picridis
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arenaria
</tp:taxon-name>
). Sixteen metabolites, including 14 phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) and 2 iridoid glycosides (IrGs), were isolated and identified using NMR spectroscopy and hydrolysis, revealing the presence of two previously undescribed PhGs in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
, named ramoside A and 2′-acetylramoside A. In addition, in the example of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. caryophyllacea
</tp:taxon-name>
, we have reported as the first occurrence of IrGs in broomrapes. Concentrations of phenylethanoids, the main constituents of broomrapes, in the studied plant material (flowering shoots with haustoria) were determined using the UHPLC-PDA method. It was found that 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
has been the richest source of PhGs. In addition, the differences between broomrapes have been visualized using principal component and cluster analysis. The results of the antiradical DPPH test of 13 PhGs confirmed previous findings on the relation of the antioxidant potential with the structure of phenolic moieties – phenolic acid and phenylethanoid unit.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
The broomrape is a general name for parasitic herbaceous plants of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
L. sensu lato genus (
<tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family). There are about 200 species of broomrapes known worldwide but these plants are mainly found in the temperate climate zone of the northern hemisphere, with the greatest density in Mediterranean Basin, western and central Asia (

; 

). In 
Poland
, the genus comprises 17 native species, which are mostly rare and endangered, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche coerulescens
Stephan ex Willd.
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. picridis
F.W. Schultz
</tp:taxon-name>
, nevertheless, the occurrence of serious agricultural pest, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
(L.) Pomel has also been confirmed. The area of their greatest concentration in 
Poland
includes the belt of the Polish Uplands (

).
</p>
         <p>
Broomrapes are non-photosynthetic (chlorophyll-lacking) root holoparasites that are totally dependent on their host plants. The number of preferred hosts is variable, and parasitic species can be divided into three groups: monophagous, oligophagous (dominating) and polyphagous (

). All broomrapes have a specially adapted intrusive organ, haustorium, that functions as a bridge connecting the parasite with its host, and allows the uptake of water and essential nutrients (

). In addition, other molecules, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and bioactive specialized metabolites, can be transported both ways with this channel. For example, there are few reports on the sequestration of phytochemicals, such as alkaloids, by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
from their host species (

).
</p>
         <p>
Broomrapes spend most of their life cycle attached to the host plant and hidden underground and become visible above the surface of the soil only at the time of flowering, in the form of short, scaly stems ended with yellow, purple, white or bluish flowers. The identification of parasites within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
taxon, due to a small number of morphological characteristics (significant reduction of vegetative organs) and high morphological variability, poses many difficulties (

). The taxonomy and phylogeny of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
genus are still discussed contentiously. At the beginning of the 21st century, on the basis of combined results of morphological, micro-morphological and molecular analyses, the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
genus was divided into two separate genera, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche
</tp:taxon-name>
(

; 

). Therefore, some species of the old 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
genus have been transferred to the newly created 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche
</tp:taxon-name>
genus, an example of which are 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
(L.) Pomel and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. aegyptiaca
(Pers.) Pomel
</tp:taxon-name>
, formerly described as 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
L. and 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. aegyptiaca
Pers.
</tp:taxon-name>
         </p>
         <p>
The chemotaxonomic analyses in combination with statistics (multivariate methods) have been found as a good auxiliary tool in the case of difficulty in distinguishing and classification of plant taxa using standard botanical methods (

). An important factor in plant chemotaxonomy studies is the occurrence of taxon-specific chemical markers, such as phytochemicals, present only in representatives of a given family/genus/species. The 
<tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family is known for the richness of metabolites from the group of phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) (

). Within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cistanche
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, due to the extensive use of Herba 
<tp:taxon-name>Cistanche</tp:taxon-name>
in Chinese traditional medicine, especially in the treatment of genitourinary system deficiencies, have been best recognized for their phytochemical composition. To date, more than 35 different PhGs have been isolated and identified in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cistanche
</tp:taxon-name>
plants, together with some other minor constituents, including benzyl glycosides, iridoids, and lignans (

). In turn, among about 200 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, only several have been so far investigated phytochemically, including 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. cernua
Loefling
</tp:taxon-name>
, 

<tp:taxon-name>O. coerulescens</tp:taxon-name>
,

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
, however, their qualitative chemical composition proved to be similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cistanche
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
(PhGs as major components, and other minor accompanying compounds, such as flavones (

) or terpenes, have been described) (

). Extracts from either 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cistanche
</tp:taxon-name>
or broomrape plants, as well as some phenylethanoid glycosides isolated from them (such as acteoside, echinacoside and crenatoside), were positively tested for a variety of biological activities including antioxidant, radical scavenging, anti-inflammatory, and memory-enhancing (

), cytotoxic against cancer cell lines (

), and antibacterial and antifungal (

). Additionally, as recently reported by 

, stems of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche crenata
Forssk.
</tp:taxon-name>
(crenate broomrape) – noxious weed of the legume crops, serve as a culinary delicacy in the 
Puglia region
(southern 
Italy
). The nutritional and culinary properties of crenate broomrape have been compared to asparagus, while the parasite has possessed several times higher antioxidant activity; thus, the broomrape plant has potential as a novel functional food. Nevertheless, despite the confirmed presence of phenylethanoid glycosides in 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. crenata
(
Scharenberg and Zidorn, 2018
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, 

did not mention which ingredients of this plant are responsible for the high anti-oxidative action demonstrated in their research.
</p>
         <p>
The aim of the phytochemical study was to perform a qualitative and quantitative investigation of six broomrape species growing in 
Poland
, including plants that have not been tested in detail: 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche caryophyllacea
Sm.
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. lutea
Baumg.
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. picridis
F.W. Schultz
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche arenaria
Pomel.
</tp:taxon-name>
The results of the quantitative content of phenylethanoid glycosides, main constituents of all studied broomrapes, were used to compare the tested plants using chemometric methods (principal component analysis and cluster analysis). In addition, isolated PhG compounds were tested for antioxidant activity using DPPH method.

2. Results and discussion
</title>
         <p>
Preliminary UHPLC-PDA-HR-MS/MS analyses of the extracts from the whole plants of six broomrape species, including 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche caryophyllacea
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coerulescens
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. lutea
</tp:taxon-name>
(two different host plants), 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. picridis
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche arenaria
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
(two different host plants), revealed the presence of several metabolites tentatively identified as phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs), which are known constituents of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cistanche
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
plants. In 
Fig. 1
, a UHPLC-PDA (max plot) chromatograms of the studied holoparasites are presented, and the identified compounds were marked with numbers that are in accordance with 
Table 1
(numbers were assigned according to retention time). As can be seen in 
Fig. 1
, the phytochemical profiles of broomrapes belonging to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. 1A and B
) were different compared to both 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche
spp
</tp:taxon-name>
, which were also significantly different from each other (
Fig. 1C and D
). Additionally, the species 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. caryophyllacea
</tp:taxon-name>
, due to the exclusive presence of two compounds tentatively identified as iridoid glycosides (compd. 
1
and 
2
, 
Fig. 1A
), could be distinguished from other three species of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coerulescens
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. lutea
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. picridis
</tp:taxon-name>
; 
Fig. 1B
), which, in turn, showed far-reaching phytochemical similarity, confirmed further by the results of quantitative and chemometric analyses.
</p>
         <p>
Due to the lack or incompleteness of literature data on some broomrape species, including 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. caryophyllacea
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. lutea
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. picridis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arenaria
</tp:taxon-name>
, and some difficulties in identifying phenylethanoid glycosides (the presence of isobaric compounds with similar spectroscopic properties) a decision was made to isolate the main plant specialized metabolites and their subsequent identification based on spectroscopic and chemical methods. From the 18 major constituents of the set of studied broomrapes, we were able to isolate 16 compounds (
1–2
, 
4–15
, 
17–18
; according to 
Table 1
) by the use of the multistep purification process, and they were further identified on the basis of NMR spectroscopy, LC-MS analyses of products of their hydrolysis, and literature data. While compounds 
3
and 
16
(
Table 1
) could not be isolated and were tentatively described on the basis of UHPLC-HR-MS/MS and literature data. Summarizing, two undescribed (
10
and 
17
, 
Table 1
) and sixteen already known natural products (
1–9
, 
11–16
, and 
18
; 
Table 1
) were identified in the set of studied broomrape species grown in 
Poland
. The structures of all detected phytochemicals are shown in 
Fig. 2
. Among already described compounds were 14 PhGs: echinacoside (
3
) (

), arenarioside (
4
) (

), acteoside (syn. verbascoside) (
5
) (

), tubuloside A (
6
) (

), poliumoside (
7
) (

), isoacteoside (
8
) (

), crenatoside (syn. orobanchoside) (
9
) (

), 3- 
O
-methylpoliumoside (
11
) (

), pheliposide (
12
) (

), leucosceptoside A (
13
) (

), 2′- 
O
-acetylacteoside (
14
) (

), 2′- 
O
-acetylpoliumoside (syn. brandioside) (
15
) (

), 2′- 
O
-acetylisoacteoside (syn. tubuloside B) (
16
) (

) and wiedemannioside D (
18
) (

), and 2 iridoid glycosides: asperulosidic acid (
1
) (

) and asperuloside (
2
) (

) (
Fig. 2
). The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data of known isolated compounds (
1–2
, 
4–9
, 
11–15
, and 
18
) are presented in the Supplementary Materials (
Tables 1S
– 
4S
). Additionally, some general conclusions can be drawn regarding the MS (ESIneg) fragmentation of phenylethanoid glycosides (
Table 1
): for all described PhG compounds, the most intense (100%) fragment ion represented hydroxycinnamic acid moiety (
m/z
161 [CA-H-H 
2
O] 
–
or 
m/z
175 [FA-H-H 
2
O] 
–
or 
m/z
145 [
p
-CoA-H-H 
2
O] 
–
), and the second most intense (about 20%) fragment ion in MS/MS spectra of most PhGs was a product of detachment of a phenolic acid fragment ([phenolic acid-H 
2
O] 
–
for nonacetylated PhGs or [phenolic acid-H 
2
O+42(acetyl)] 
–
for acetylated PhGs) from a deprotonated ion [M-H] 
–
.
</p>
         <p>
Compound 
10
was a previously undescribed phenylethanoid glycoside isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
, and received a trivial name ramoside A. The negative- and positive-ion HR-QTOF-MS spectra of 
10
showed deprotonated molecule at 
m/z
753.2593 [M-H] 
–
and adduct ions at 
m/z
772.3013 [M+NH

+
and 755.2756 [M+H] 
+
, respectively, and its molecular formula was determined as C 
35
H 
46
O 
18
. In the MS/MS spectrum of ion peak at 
m/z
755.2756 the following fragment ions were observed:

         <p>
The
13
C-NMR of compound 
10
showed 32 signals that were classified as two 
CH
3
, three 
CH
2
, 21 
CH
, and six quaternary carbon atoms (
Table 2
). 
The
1
H-NMR spectrum of 
10
demonstrated signals corresponding to: hydroxytyrosol moiety – two methylenes [
δH
2.79, 2.82 (1H each, H 
2
-7), and 3.73, 3.99 (1H each, H 
2
-8)], and 
ortho-
and 
meta-
coupled ABC-type aromatic protons [
δH
6.57 (1H, H-2), 6.69 (1H, H-3), and 6.70 (1H, H-6); β-glucopyranosyl unit [
δH
4.37 (1H, H-1′)]; two α-rhamnopyranosyl units [
δH
5.19 (1H, H-1″), and 4.63 (1H, H-1‴)]; and a 
trans-p
-coumaroyl moiety – a 
trans-
olefin protons [
δH
6.34 (1H, H-8‴′), and 7.67 (1H, H-7‴′)], and AA’XX’- 
type
aromatic protons [
δH
6.81, 7.47 (2H each, H-3‴′,5‴′ and 2‴′, 6‴′) (
Table 2
). Connection locations between sugar and acyl moieties in 
10
were revealed by an HMBC spectrum, which showed correlations between the following proton-carbon pairs: H-1′(Glc) and C-8 (hydroxytyrosol, 
δC
72.4), H-4′ [Glc, 
δH
5.00 (1H)] and the 
p-
coumaroyl carbonyl carbon (
δC
168.0, C9‴′), H-1′′ (Rha) and C-3′ (Glc, 
δC
81.6), H-1‴ (Rha) and C-6′ (Glc, 
δC
67.6). The α/β-orientation of anomeric protons was based on measurements of direct 
1
JHC coupling constants using F2-coupled perfect CLIP-HSQC spectra (

) – 159 Hz for H-1′-C-1′ of Glc, 171 Hz for H-1″-C-1″ of Rha and 169 for H-1‴-C-1‴ of Rha (

). Finally, acid hydrolysis of 
10
and subsequent UHPLC-PDA-MS/ MS analysis of derivatization reaction products allowed to identify Dglucose and L-rhamnose. Therefore, the structure of ramoside A was elucidated to be 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl 
O
-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 6)]-4- 
O -trans-p-
coumaroylβ-D-glucopyranoside (
10
) (
Fig. 2
).
</p>
         <p>
Compound 
17
, isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
, was an acylated derivative of ramoside A (
10
). The negative- and positive-ion HR-QTOF-MS spectra of 
17
showed deprotonated molecule at 
m/z
795.2695 [M-H] 
–
and adduct ions at 
m/z
814.3121 [M+NH 
4
] 
+
and 797.2832 [M+H] 
+
, respectively, and its molecular formula was determined as C 
37
H 
48
O 
19
. The 
1
H and 
13
C-NMR spectra of 
17
were very similar to those of 
10
, except for additional signals due to the presence of an acetyl group (
Table 2
). Its location has been set at C-2′ based on HMBC correlation between H-2′ [Glc, 
δH
4.87 (1H)] and the acetyl carbonyl carbon (
δC
171.4) (
Table 2
). Key 2D-NMR (COSY, HMBC and NOESY) correlations for compound 
17
are presented in 
Fig. 3
. Acid hydrolysis of 
17
and subsequent UHPLC-PDA-MS/MS analysis of derivatization reaction products, as for compound 
10
, allowed to identify D-glucose and L-rhamnose. Therefore, the structure of 2′- 
O
-acetylramoside A was elucidated to be 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl 
O
-α-Lrhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 6)]-2- 
O
-acetyl-4- 
O - trans-p-
coumaroyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (
17
) (
Fig. 2
).

Summarizing, to the best of our knowledge, three broomrape species i.e. 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. caryophyllacea
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. lutea
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. picridis
</tp:taxon-name>
have never been the subject of detailed phytochemical study, therefore, we are the first who described the occurrence of PhGs and iridoids (
<tp:taxon-name>
O. caryophyllacea
</tp:taxon-name>
) in these species. Moreover, although iridoid glycosides (IrGs) are known constituents (genuine or sequestered from host plant) of the holoparasitic 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cistanche
spp. (Orobanchaceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
(

), they have never been reported in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche
</tp:taxon-name>
genera. However, the sequestration of IrGs, including asperulosidic acid and asperuloside, by the hemiparasite 
<tp:taxon-name>
Euphrasia stricta
J.F.Lehm
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>

) from its host 
<tp:taxon-name>
Galium verum
</tp:taxon-name>
L. (
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>

Phenylethanoid glycosides represent the largest group of natural products identified in parasitic plants of the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>
. Due to the fact that PhG compounds are usually not found in host species, they are considered as specialized metabolites synthesized by the parasites, as opposed to compounds sequestered from the hosts (alkaloids, flavonoids, and polyacetylenes) (

). Nevertheless, the occurrence of phenylethanoid glycosides has also been reported in many other non-parasitic plants, especially from the order 
<tp:taxon-name>Lamiales</tp:taxon-name>
, including the families 
<tp:taxon-name>Oleaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Plantaginaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Scrophulariaceae (
Jiménez and Riguera, 1994
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. The physiological role of specialized metabolites in broomrapes, such as PhGs, is not fully understood (the lack of literature data in this topic). Due to the demonstrated antibacterial and antimicrobial activity of phenylethanoid glycosides, it has been proposed that their role in the plants may be associated with the resistance to, or protection from, pathogenic microorganisms attacks (

).

There are only a few publications dealing with the quantification of phenylethanoid glycosides in holoparasitic plants of 
<tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, and they basically concern Herba Cistanches (
<tp:taxon-name>
Cistanche
species
</tp:taxon-name>
– 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. deserticola
Y.C.Ma
</tp:taxon-name>

(Schenk) Wight
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. sinensis
Beck
</tp:taxon-name>
) (

; 

; 

). In addition, remarkable and difficult to explain differences have been revealed among the contents of PhGs in different species and batches of Cistanches Herba. For example, either acteoside or echinacoside has been described as the main components of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. deserticola
</tp:taxon-name>
, and their content in different samples varied in the range 
0.8–31.4 mg
/g or 
2.3–27.1 mg
/g, respectively, (

; 

); while echinacoside has been found as the main constituent of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. tubulosa
</tp:taxon-name>
, and its level in different samples varied greatly in the range 
1.4–378.5 mg
/g (

; 

); in turn, the dominant compound of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. sinensis
</tp:taxon-name>
was poliumoside, and its concentration in different batches varied in the range 
3.4–36.2 mg
/g (

). The above quantitative differences have been linked to multiple factors, including environmental conditions and genetic variations (

).

         <p>
For quantitative analysis of PhGs, the main phytochemical constituents of broomrapes, in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
extracts, a developed UHPLC-PDA method (UV 
330 nm
detection) and external standard method (acteoside as group standard) were employed. Results of quantification, calculated per dry plant matter (DW), are presented in Table 3. Acteoside (
5
) was found as the major constituent of all studied 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
, and its concentrations were very high, ranging from 
183.4 to 284.2 mg
/g of dry weight. The amounts of other determined PhGs (isoacteoside, crenatoside, leucosceptoside A, and 2′-acetylacteoside) were considerably (several times) lower in comparison to acteoside in four 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
species
</tp:taxon-name>
(Table 3). The main constituent of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arenaria
</tp:taxon-name>
was arenarioside (
4
, about 
80 mg
/g DW), followed by acteoside (about 
70 mg
/g DW), while the levels of other measured PhGs (echinacoside, isoacteoside, pheliposide, leucosceptoside A, and 2′-acetylacteoside) were several times lower compared to both compounds 
4
and 
5
. Poliumoside (
7
) and its acylated derivative (2′-acetylpoliumoside, 
15
) were found as dominant components of both 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
samples, where they represented on average 55.8% (
208.1 mg
/g DW) and 23.8% (
88.6 mg
/g DW), respectively, of total PhGs. While, the concentrations of other 8 determined phenylethanoid glycosides (acteoside, isoacteoside, ramoside A, 3-methylpoliumoside, leucosceptoside A, 2′-acetylacteoside, 2′-acetylramoside A, and wiedemannioside D) were much lower (Table 3). The examined broomrape species also differed in the overall content of PhGs, the highest value was described in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
(about 
370 mg
/g DW), followed by 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coerulescens
</tp:taxon-name>
(about 
315 mg
/g DW), while the lowest in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arenaria
</tp:taxon-name>
(about 
180 mg
/g DW) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. picridis
</tp:taxon-name>
(about 
205 mg
/g DW).

         <p>
To visualize chemical similarities and/or differences between studied broomrape species, and relationships between determined compounds and examined plant samples, the principal component analysis (PCA), and cluster analysis (CA) were performed. The PCA enabled the reduction of all quantitative data to four principal components (PC1- PC4) which explained 99% of the entire variation (
Fig. 4A
). The inspection of 
Fig. 4B
1-2
reveals that the four examined 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
species
</tp:taxon-name>
showed a great similarity (created one cluster in projection PC1 vs PC2), while both 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
created their own separate groups that were formed by relevant variables (compounds present only in a given species). In this way, our results, showing the phytochemical distinctiveness of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche
</tp:taxon-name>
plants, are consistent with previous morphological and molecular studies (

; 

), which resulted in taxonomic separation of both genera; and confirm the usefulness of chemotaxonomic studies (combination of phytochemical and chemometric analyses) as complementary tool in plant classification. In addition, other very interesting chemotaxonomic conclusions can be drawn based on our PCA and CA analyses (using phytochemical quantitative data), for example, the 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. caryophyllacea
</tp:taxon-name>
species, due to the presence of the relatively high amount of compound 
14
(2′- 
O
-acetylacteoside), was the most detached from the monolithic 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
cluster (
Fig. 4C
1-2
). Moreover, the distinctiveness of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. caryophyllacea
</tp:taxon-name>
should be even greater when considering the exclusive presence of iridoid glycosides in this species, which were not quantified in the current study (
Fig. 1
). This is the first report on the occurrence of iridoids in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
plant, and as the presence of asperuloside and asperulosidic acid has been confirmed so far only in 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. caryophyllacea
</tp:taxon-name>
(while not present in 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coerulescens
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. lutea
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. picridis
</tp:taxon-name>
), these compounds can serve as chemotaxonomic markers of this species. In addition, our quantitative and chemometric analyses (CA and PCA) showed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arenaria
</tp:taxon-name>
species appears to be more phytochemically related rather to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
plants than to another examined 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche
species
</tp:taxon-name>
– 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
, which is mainly associated with the increased content of compounds 
5
(acteoside) and 
13
(leucosceptoside A) and significantly lower total PhGs content (
Fig. 4C
1-2
and 
5S
; Table 3).

         <p>
</p>
         <p>
Results complementary to the PCA were obtained after applying cluster analysis. The CA dendrograms for plant samples and PhGs are presented in the Supplementary Materials (
Fig. 5S
). Finally, two broomrape species collected from two different hosts, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. lutea
</tp:taxon-name>
parasitizing on 
<tp:taxon-name>
Medicago falcata
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. sativa
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
parasitizing on tomato and tobacco, showed a far-reaching similarity regardless of the host plant, both in terms of the qualitative and quantitative phytochemical profiles (
Fig. 4B and C
and 
5S
, Table 3).

         <p>
The antiradical scavenging capacity of 13 isolated PhG compounds (
4–12
, 
14–15
, 
17–18
) was expressed as Trolox Equivalents (TE) and IC 
50
. The results are shown in 
Table 4
. Additionally, curves (inhibition % vs sample concentration) obtained for Trolox and tested phenylethanoid glycosides are presented in the Supplementary Materials (Fig. 6S). All tested phenolic compounds exhibited dose-dependent activity to scavenge DPPH free radicals 
in vitro
. Nevertheless, differences in the demonstrated antioxidant potential have been observed between investigated PhGs. The estimated TE values varied from 31% to 87% of Trolox activity (1.00). With regard to the IC 
50
values, the obtained results were between 1.2 and 3.1-fold higher (46–122 μg DW/ mL) compared to the positive control (Trolox, 40 μg DW/mL). The highest anti-oxidative action was shown by acteoside (
5
), followed by isoacteoside (
8
) and 2′- 
O
-acetylacteoside (
14
), however, with the exception of 4 compounds (
10
, 
11
, 
17
, and 
18
) marked in green in 
Table 5
, differences in activity between the tested compounds were not very large (compounds marked in red/pink in 

Table 4; 
4

–9, 
12
, 
14–15
). Whereas, four abovementioned PhGs (
10
, 
11
, 
17
, and 
18
), having substituted caffeoyl moiety by feruloyl or 
p
-coumaroyl moiety, were about 3-fold less active in comparison to the positive control (Trolox). In general, the results of our test are in accordance and confirm the findings of the previous antioxidant 
in vitro
experiments on phenylethanoids. In a study by 

, the authors measured the effects of a number of PhGs, differing in the molecular structure, on the production of reactive oxygen species in a luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence assay with FMLP stimulated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. As a result, the antioxidant activity of phenylethanoid glycosides has been mainly related to the structure of the acyl moieties (phenolic acid and phenylethanoid unit), including the presence and/or modification of catechol moiety. For example, replacement of the caffeoyl by a feruloyl moiety has resulted in a slight but significant decrease in the radical scavenger activity. In turn, the position of the acyl moiety (acteoside activity vs. isoacteoside activity), as well as modification of the sugar chain has been found to be of minor importance (

). Similarly, all tested by us polyphenolic compounds acylated with caffeic acid and hydroxytyrosol (both containing catechol moiety) demonstrated strong and comparable antioxidant activity, whereas compounds having replaced caffeoyl moiety by either feruloyl (3- 
O
-methylpoliumoside and wiedemannioside D) or 
p
-coumaroyl (ramoside A and 2′-acetylramoside A) moiety possessed significantly decreased anti-oxidative potential.

3. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
The current phytochemical study is the first report on the occurrence of phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) and iridoids in six broomrape species growing in 
Poland
, including 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche picridis
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. caryophyllacea
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coerulescens
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. lutea
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche arenaria
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
. Among the 18 described major compounds in the set of investigated broomrapes, we found in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
two novel phenylethanoids acylated with 
p
-coumaric acid, named ramoside A and 2′-acetylramoside A. Due to limited literature data on the quantity of PhGs in holoparasites of 
<tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(research focused exclusively on Herba Cistanches), we performed quantification of phenylethanoids in the whole plants (flower shoots with underground haustoria) of six Polish broomrape species. It was found that all tested 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche
</tp:taxon-name>
plants are rich in PhGs (
180–380 mg
/g DW), and their amount in the studied plant material is even greater than that reported for Herba Cistanches. The results of the antiradical DPPH test of 13 isolated polyphenolic compounds demonstrated high and comparable antioxidant potential of PhGs containing two catechol moieties in their structure (caffeic acid and hydroxytyrosol), regardless of the modification of either the acylation site or the sugar chain. While the modification of catechol moiety of phenolic acid has caused a significant decrease in the activity. The present study provides insights for the potential applications of broomrapes as a component of a nutraceutical and medical preparation, similarly to the Herba Cistanches.

), equipped with 
5 mm
broad-band inverse (BBI) probe. Data processing was performed with the Topspin software (version 3.5pl2, Bruker BioSpin). High resolution MS spectra, exact masses of compounds, MS/ MS fragmentation patterns, and molecular formulas were received using a Thermo Scientific Ultimate 3000 RS chromatographic system coupled with a Bruker Impact II HD (Bruker, Billerica, MA, 
USA
) quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer and a BEH C18 column (2.1 × 
100 mm
, 1.7 μm, Waters, Milford, MA, 
USA
). The MS ion source was operated in the negative and positive electrospray ionization mode, with the following settings: mass scan range 

50–2000 
m

/z; capillary voltage 3.0 kV and 4.5 kV, respectively; nebulizer and drying gas (N 
2
) 0.7 bar and 6 L/min, respectively; dry gas temperature 200 °C. The MS/MS spectra were acquired using variable collision energy in the range from 2.5 to 80 eV. The acquired data were calibrated internally with sodium formate introduced to the ion source via a 20 μL loop at the beginning of each analysis. The UV absorbance detection in the 
200–600 nm
wavelength range (
5 nm
bandwidth, 10 Hz frequency) was combined with MS analyses. Data were collected and processed using DataAnalysis 4.3 software (Bruker). The final step of purification of compounds was performed on HPLC system (Dionex) equipped with a photodiode array detector PDA-100 and fraction collector FC 204 (Gilson, Middleton, WI, 
USA
). Separations were carried out on a semi-preparative reversed-phase column Kromasil C18 (10 × 
250 mm
, 5 μm, AkzoNobel, Bohus, 
Sweden
). Quantitative UHPLC analyses were performed using a Waters ACQUITY chromatographic system equipped with PDA detector and Triple Quadrupole (TQD) Mass Detector (Waters). Separations were carried out on a BEH C18 column (2.1 × 
100 mm
, 1.7 μm, Waters). Plant material and pure isolated compounds were dried using Gamma 2–16 LSC freeze dryer (Christ, Osterode am Harz, 
Germany
). Automated extractions were made using Dionex ASE 200 extractor (Dionex).

4.4. Extraction and isolation
</p>
         <p>
For isolation of compounds the three broomrape species: 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. caryophyllacea
</tp:taxon-name>
(O.C.), 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. arenaria
</tp:taxon-name>
(P.A.) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. ramosa
</tp:taxon-name>
(P.R.), differing in phytochemical composition (according to preliminary UHPLC-PDA-MS analyses), were chosen. Powdered plant material (O.C. – 
2 g
; P.A. and P.R. – 
3 g
) was extracted with accelerated solvent extractor Dionex ASE using 80% MeOH (v/v), at 40 °C and 1500 psi (solvent pressure), and three repeated static extraction cycles. The obtained extracts were evaporated and freeze-dried. The yields of extraction were 55% (O.C.), 36.7% (P.A.), and 43.3% (P.R.). The crude methanol extracts were purified by reverse-phase (RP) chromatography, in a stepwise manner. First, the polar constituents (mainly sugars) were removed from the extracts, and they were initially divided into three fractions by solidphase extraction (SPE). The extracts were applied to a preconditioned RP-C 
18
column (30 × 
80 mm
, Cosmosil 40C 
18
-PREP, 40 μm; Nacalai Tesque, INC, 
Kyoto
, 
Japan
), followed by elution with 0.2% MeOH (v/v, containing 0.1% FA,v/v), 20% MeOH (v/v, fraction 1), 40% MeOH (v/ v, fraction 2), and then 80% MeOH (v/v, fraction 3). The fractionation process was monitored by UHPLC-PDA-MS analyses. Individual compounds were obtained from the O.C., P.A. and P.R. fractions 1–3 by means of semi-preparative HPLC. The conditions of chromatographic separation were individually optimized for each fraction. Separations were carried out in isocratic or gradient mode, using aqueous 31–44% MeOH (containing 0.1% formic acid). The mobile phase flow rate was 2.5 mL/min, and the column temperature was maintained between 21 and 35 °C. The PDA detector was operated at 210 and 
330 nm
wavelengths. As a result of chromatographic separation of the O.C. fractions the following compounds were isolated: Fr. 1 yielded compound 
1
(
2.5 mg
) and 
2
(
11 mg
), Fr. 3 yielded compound 
5
(
240 mg
), 
8
(
4.5 mg
), 
9
(
15.5 mg
), 
13
(
1.1 mg
), and 
14
(
23 mg
). Separation of the P.A. fraction 2 produced compound 
4
(
36 mg
), 
5
(
24.7 mg
), 
6
(
11.5 mg
), 
12
(
186.4 mg
) and 
14
(
8.9 mg
). Chromatographic separation of the P.R. fractions enabled to obtain the following compounds: from Fr. 2 was obtained compound 
5
(
7.3 mg
) and 
7
(
9.2 mg
), and Fr. 3 yielded compound 
7
(
9.5 mg
), 
10
(
3.2 mg
), 
11
(
12.8 mg
), 
15
(

), 
17
(

(

).

4.5. Determination the absolute configuration of monosaccharides
</p>
         <p>
The absolute configuration of monosaccharides was determined after acid hydrolysis of each isolated compound (
1–2
, 
4–15
, 
17–18
) in 1 mL of 4M HCl solution at 100 °C. The sugar-containing aqueous layer, obtained after extraction with ethyl acetate, was neutralized with Amberlite IRA-400 (OH − form). Released monosaccharides were derivatized and determined according to the modified method of

For quantitative analyses, the 
100 mg
of powdered plant material was extracted with Dionex ASE 200 extractor using the same conditions as for the isolation of compounds (section 4.4). Obtained extracts were concentrated and cleaned to remove the sugars by SPE using Sep-Pak C18 classic cartridges (
360 mg
, Waters). The compounds of interest were eluted with 80% MeOH. The samples, after evaporation, were dissolved in 1 mL of 50% MeOH. Before analysis samples were centrifuged (16,000× 
g
) and appropriately diluted with 50% MeOH.

4.7.2. UHPLC-PDA-MS analyses
</title>
         <p>
UHPLC analyses were performed using Waters ACQUITY chromatographic system with PDA detector and TQD-MS detector and BEH C18 column (2.1 × 
100 mm
, 1.7 μm, Waters). The chromatographic conditions were as follows: linear gradient 10 → 25% of mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) in mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in H 
2
O) over 12 min; flow rate – 0.4 mL/min; oven temperature – 25 °C; injection volume – 2 μL. The UV spectra were recorded in the 
190–490 nm
wavelength range (
3.6 nm
resolution). The MS analyses were performed in negative ion mode with electrospray ionization (ESI). The other settings of MS detector were as follows: scan range – 

100–1200 
m

/z; capillary voltage – 2.8 kV; cone voltage – 50 V; source temperature – 140 °C, desolvation temperature – 350 °C, desolvation gas flow – 800 L/h; cone gas flow – 100 L/h. For quantitative analysis, the phenylethanoid glycosides in plant samples, and the used reference compound – acteoside (≥99%, HPLC, Sigma-Aldrich), were detected at UV 
330 nm
. The external calibration curve was prepared in six concentrations within the range of 0.8–200 μg/mL. The regression coefficient (R 
2
) for the calibration curve was calculated to be 0.9999, and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to be 0.78 μg/mL. Three independent chromatographic runs were performed for each sample/ standard working solution. To calculate the quantitative content of individual compounds, using an external calibration curve, the areas of the chromatographic peaks for the isolated compounds (
4–15
, 
17–18
) were corrected based on the calculated molar absorption coefficients (
ε
) at a wavelength of 
330 nm
(
Table 1
). For non-isolated PhG compounds 
3
and 
16
, and compound 
13
(isolated in very low amount) a raw chromatographic data (without correction) was used. Molar absorption coefficient values for PhGs were calculated based on absorbance measurements (at 
330 nm
) of compounds dissolved in 15% MeCN (at least three different concentrations within the range of 0.25–8 mM) using Thermo Scientific Evolution 260 Bio spectrophotometer.

4.8. Determination of free radical scavenging activity of phenylethanoid glycosides
</title>
         <p>
The free radical scavenging activity of the isolated phenylethanoid glycosides against DPPH radical was determined using the method of 

, with slight modifications. First, DPPH solution with methanol (100 μM), and solutions of freeze-dried compounds with 50% methanol (four different concentrations in the range of 10–70 μg/mL (compounds 
4–9
, 
12
, 
14
, 
15
) or 20–140 μg/mL (compound 
10
, 
11
, 
17
, 
18
)), and Trolox solutions with 50% methanol (five different concentrations ranging from 5 to 60 μg/mL) were prepared. Subsequently, a 30 μL of compound solution or Trolox solution or 50% methanol (control) was added to 170 μL of DPPH solution in a well of a 96-well plate. The reaction mixture was mixed gently, incubated in the dark for 30 min, and then the absorbance was recorded at 
517 nm
using a microplate reader (Infinite 200 Pro, Tecan, 
Austria
).
</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>The percentage of absorbance inhibition was calculated from the equation:</p>
         <p>Inhibition (%) = 100 × [(Acontrol Asample)/Acontrol]</p>
         <p>
where 
Acontrol
and 
Asample
are the absorbance values of the control and test samples at t = 30 min, respectively.
</p>
         <p>
Linear curves were obtained for Trolox and each tested compound using the relationship of standard/sample concentration (μg/mL) to absorbance inhibition (%). To obtain Trolox Equivalents (TE) for the thirteen tested compounds slopes of their curves were divided by the slope of the Trolox curve. The IC 
50
values of isolated phenylethanoid glycosides on DPPH (defined as the concentration of sample necessary to cause 50% inhibition) were determined from the same linear curves (the percentage of scavenging activity plotted against the sample concentration), and Trolox was used as a positive control.
