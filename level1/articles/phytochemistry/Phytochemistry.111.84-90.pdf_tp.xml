A crude enzyme solution was prepared from young rice seedlings, and the metabolism of C 
29
-brassinosteroids identified from the seedlings was examined. When 28-homoteasterone was added as a substrate, 28-homotyphasterol, teasterone, and 26-nor-28-homoteasterone were characterized as enzyme products by GC–MS/SIM analysis. With 28-homotyphasterol, 28-homoteasterone, typhasterol, 28-homocastasterone, and 26-nor-28-homotyphasterol were formed and identified as products. When 28-homocastasterone was used, castasterone and 26-nor-28-homocastasterone were identified as products. Together with the reduced biological activity of C 
29
-brassinosteroids and their metabolites in the rice lamina inclination assay, these metabolic studies suggest a biosynthetic sequence, 28-homoteasterone 
M
28-homotyphasterol 
+
28-homocastasterone for C 
29
-brassinosteroid biosynthesis is connected to the biosynthetic sequence teasterone 
M
typhasterol 
+
castasterone for C 
28
-brassinosteroids by C-28 demethylation, i.e., in order to increase biological activity in the rice plant. Additionally, the C 
29
-brassinosteroids seem to bio-degrade their C-26 demethylated C 
28
-brassinosteroid analogs to reduce brassinosteroid activity 
in planta
. In conclusion, the biosynthesis of C 
29
-brassinosteroids is a likely alternative route to the biologically-active brassinosteroid, castasterone, in rice.

         <p>As steroidal plant hormones, brassinosteroids (BRs) show diverse physiological functions affecting growth and development during the entire life cycle of plants (Choe, 2004; Clouse and Sasse, 1998; Kim and Wang, 2010; Wu et al., 2008), and it is important that the optimal level of biologically-active BRs is maintained in plant tissues. Among the various regulatory mechanisms for homeostasis of BRs, biosynthesis is an important factor for maintaining endogenous levels of active BRs in plant tissues.</p>

Among the more than fifty naturally-occurring BRs, castasterone (CS) (
6
, see Fig. 1) and brassinolide (BL) are the most frequently identified in the entire plant kingdom (Bajguz and Tretyn, 2003; Bishop and Yokota, 2001; Fujioka and Yokota, 2003). CS (
6
) and BL, which are the end products of BR biosynthesis, show stronger biological activity than any other natural BRs, suggesting CS (
6
) and BL are the most physiologically important BRs (Bishop and Yokota, 2001; Fujioka and Yokota, 2003). Biochemical and molecular genetic

analysis indicated that CS (
6
) and BL are biosynthesized from a common phytosterol, campesterol (CR) (
3
), which has the same carbon skeleton as that of CS (
6
) and BL (Suzuki et al., 1993), suggesting that the biosynthesis of CS (
6
) and BL from CR (
3
) is a main biosynthetic route used to synthesize biologically-active BRs 
in planta
(Suzuki et al., 1993; Yokota, 1997) (Fig. 1).

Besides CR (
3
), cholesterol (CHR), 24-methylene-CHR (24-MCHR) (
1
), isofucosterol (IFUR), and sitosterol (STR) (
7
) are quite common in plants (Carland et al., 2002; Diener et al., 2000; Jang et al., 2000; Klahre et al., 1998; Schrick et al., 2000; Souter et al., 2002). Since 28-norCS, dolichosterone (DS) (
2
), 28-homodolichosterone, and 28-homocastasterone (28-homoCS) (
10
) have the same carbon backbone as CHR, 24-MCHR (
1
), IFUR, and STR (
7
), respectively, multiple biosynthetic pathways used to generate diverse BRs are operating in plants (Yokota, 1997). Recently, it was demonstrated in tomato and 
<tp:taxon-name>Arabidopsis</tp:taxon-name>
that 28-norCS is converted to CS (
6
) via DS (
2
), suggesting that the biosynthesis of 28-norCS from CHR and DS (
2
) from 24-MCHR (
1
) are alternative routes used to produce CS (
6
) in plants (Joo et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2004a).

From rice plants, the presence of 6-deoxocastasterone (6-deoxoCS), CS (
6
), BL, DS (
2
), 28-homoteasterone (28-homoTE) (
8
), and 28-homotyphasterol (28-homoTY) (
9
) was demonstrated (Bajguz and Tretyn, 2003). This implies that at least three biosynthetic pathways are operative to generate 24-methyl BRs [6-deoxoCS, CS

), and BL], 24-methylene BR [DS (
2
)], and 24-ethyl BRs [28-homoTE (
8
) and 28-homoTY (
9
)] in the rice plant. Hong et al. (2005) have reported that a defect in BR-deficient dwarf2 (
brd2
) increases endogenous levels of DS (
2
), but reduces the endogenous levels of CS (
6
) in rice. Recently, it was found that a 
BRD2
ortholog in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Arabidopsis, 
DWARF
</tp:taxon-name>
1, encodes a BR 24-reductase that catalyzes the conversion of DS (
2
) to CS (
6
) (unpublished data). These demonstrate that the biosynthesis of DS (
2
) is an alternative route to generate CS (
6
) in rice plants. However, the purpose of biosynthesis of 24-ethyl BRs occurs in rice has not been elucidated.

         <p>In this study, identification of 24-ethyl BRs from rice seedlings was carried out. The metabolism of the identified 24-ethyl BRs was then examined in a crude enzyme extract prepared from the seedlings. Finally, the biological activity of 24-ethyl BRs was investigated in the rice lamina inclination bioassay. With the results obtained, the physiological role of 24-ethyl BRs in biosynthesis in rice seedlings was addressed.</p>

The presence of 28-homoCS (
10
) and/or 28-homoBL, biologically active end products for the biosynthesis of C 
29
-BRs, was examined in young seedlings of rice. The seedlings were extracted and the extract was solvent-partitioned and purified by column chromatography using the rice lamina inclination assay as a guide to detect BRs activity. The resulting biologically-active fractions were further purified by reversed-phase HPLC. HPLC fractions 29 and 30 corresponding to authentic 28-homoCS (
10
) were converted to bismethaneboronate (BMB) derivatives and analyzed via capillary GC–MS. As summarized in Table 1, a BMB derivative from an active compound in the HPLC fractions gave molecular and prominent mass ions at 
m
/ 
z
526 [M

], 441, 358, 328, 287, and 169 at the same GC retention time (35.34 min) as that of synthetic 28-homoCS (
10
) BMB. Therefore, the occurrence of

         <title>Orphanage</title>
         <p>
28-homoCS (
10
) was demonstrated in the rice seedlings. HPLC fractions 24 and 25, where authentic 28-homoBL would be expected to elute, was analyzed by GC–MS/selected ion monitoring (SIM). However, 28-homoBL was not detected in the HPLC fractions even by GC–SIM analysis. Therefore, the end of biosynthesis of C 
29
-BRs seems to be 28-homoCS (
10
) in the seedlings.

-BR biosynthesis in the rice seedlings was examined with a cell-free enzyme extract prepared from the seedlings. Prior to the enzyme assay, the presence of CS (
6
), which is the most abundant BR in rice seedlings, was investigated in the enzyme extract. CS (
6
) was not detected in the enzyme extract by GC–MS/SIM analysis, indicating that no detectable amounts of BRs were present in. C 
29
-BRs identified from rice plants such as 28-homoTE (
8

When 28-homoTE (

454, 389, and 300 for the MB-TMSi ether of the product suggest that the ring structure of the product is the same as that of TE (

155 due to fission of the C20-C22 bond indicates that the vicinal hydroxyls at C22 and C23 in the product formed a MB derivative like TE (

The MB-TMSi ether of a third BR in this HPLC fraction exhibited an identical mass spectrum to that of TY (

The occurrence of 28-homoCS (

<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
), and an alga (
<tp:taxon-name>
Hydrodictyon reticulatum
</tp:taxon-name>
), indicating that C 
29
24-ethyl BRs are quite common in the plant kingdom (Abe et al., 1983, 1984, 1995; Griffiths et al., 1995; Schmidt et al., 1993, 1995; Yokota et al., 1987). Nevertheless, little is known about how C 
29
-BRs are biosynthesized in plants. In this study, 28- homoCS (
10
) from the seedlings of rice was identified. Coupled with the presence of STR (
7
), 28-homoTE (
8

10
) can be biosynthesized from STR (

ation from 28-homoTE (
8
) to 28-homoCS (
10
), are the same reactions found in C 
27
-BRs and C 
28
-BRs biosynthesis (Joo et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2004a; Park et al., 1999). Additionally, a BR biosynthetic enzyme, cytochrome P450 90B1 (CYP90B1), was known to catalyze C-22 hydroxylation of CHR to 22-hydroxyCHR, CR (
3
) to 22-hydroxyCR, and STR (
7
) to 22-hydroxySTR, which is the first reaction in the biosynthesis of C 
27
-BRs, C 
28
-BRs, and C 
29
-BRs, respectively (Fujita et al., 2006). Although the down-stream biosynthetic sequence from 22-hydroxySTR to 28-homoTE (
8
) has not been determined, these data suggest that 28-homoCS (
10
) is biosynthesized from STR (
7
) via a similar route to that of CS (
6
) from CR (
3
) and 28-norCS from CHR in plants.

         <p>
In every plant where 28-homoCS (
10
) was identified, CS (
6
) always co-exists, suggesting that their biosynthesis are simultaneously operative and can be connected in the plants (Bajguz and Tretyn, 2003). In fact, in this study, the enzyme extract prepared from rice seedlings catalyzes conversion of 28-homoCS (
10
) to CS (
6
). Additionally, two biosynthetic precursors of 28-homoCS (
10
), 28-homoTE (
8
), and 28-homoTY (
9
), are converted into TE (
4
) and TY (
5
), respectively, demonstrating that C 
29
-BRs biosynthesis is biosynthetically connected to C 
28
-BRs biosynthesis between 28- homoTE (
8
) and TE (
4
), 28-homoTY (
9
) and TY (
5
), and 28-homoCS (
10
) and CS (
6
) in rice seedlings. The conversion rate in the rice enzyme solution for 28-homoTE (
8
) to TE (
4
), 28-homoTY (
9
) to TY (
5
), and 28-homoCS (
10
) to CS (
6
) indicates that the C-28 demethylase responsible for the conversion of C 
29
-BRs to C 
28
-BRs has a higher affinity for 28-homoCS (
10
) than for its biosynthetic precursors (Table 3). Therefore, it seems that the biosynthetic connection of C 
29
-BRs and C 
28
-BRs occurs mainly between the end products of the C 
29
-BR and C 
28
-BR pathways. Additionally, 28-homoTE (
8
), 28-homoTY (
9
), and 28-homoCS (
10
) show weak biological activity when compared to TE (
4
), TY (
5
), and CS (
6
), respectively, in the rice lamina inclination assay (Fig. 3), indicating that C-28 demethylation of 28-homoTE (
8
), 28-homoTY (
9
), and 28-homoCS (
10
) is a biosynthetic reaction which increases biological activity in BR biosynthesis. Together with the biosynthetic sequence TE (
4
) 
+
TY (
5
) 
+
CS (
6
), the biosynthesis of 24-ethyl BRs may thus be another route to produce the biologically active BR, CS (
6
), in the rice plants.

, 28-norCS is also converted into 26, 28-didemethylat- ed CS (Joo et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2004a). In this study herein, it was found that 28-homoTE (
8
), 28-homoTY (
9
) and 28-homoCS (
10
) were converted into 26-nor-28-homoTE (
11
), 26-nor-28-homoTY (
12
), and 26-nor-28-homoCS (
13
), respectively, in the rice enzyme extract. This indicated that C-26 demethylation occurs at the terminal alkyl in the side-chain of C 
27
-BRs, C 
28
-BRs, and C 
29
-BRs in plants. In the bioassay, 26-norCS and 26-norBL show 5–10 times less biological activity than do CS (
6
) and BL, respectively, indicating that C-26 demethylation is a deactivating process for C 
28
-BRs (Joo et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2004a). From this standpoint, C-26 demethylation of 28-homoTE (
8
), 28-homoTY (
9
), and 28-homoCS (
10
) may also serve to deactivate in C 
29
-BRs biosynthesis in rice seedlings.

It was previously proposed that C-26 demethylation of CS (
6
) and BL may occur via intermediates with C-26 being either a hydroxymethyl, aldehyde, or carboxyl group (Kim et al., 2000). In support of this, the 
<tp:taxon-name>Arabidopsis</tp:taxon-name>
gene 
BAS
1 was found to encode a cytochrome P450 (CYP734A1) mediating C-26 hydroxylation of CS (
6
) and BL (Turk et al., 2005). Additionally, Sakamoto et al. (2011) demonstrated that rice CYP734As are involved in the formation of not only C-26 alcohol, but also C-26 aldehyde and C-26 carboxylate in C-26 demethylation. However, they could not identify 26-norBRs as an enzyme product of CYP734As, suggesting that an additional enzyme, namely BR C-26 decarboxylase, might be needed for C-26 demethylation. C-28 demethylation of C 
29
-BRs to C 
28
-BRs may occur via basically the same reactions found in C-26 demethylation of BRs, suggesting that the same CYP734As and BR C-26 decarboxylase could catalyze the C-28 demethylation of C 
29
-BRs in rice. However, the possibility seems to be low because the same enzymes are unlikely to mutually catalyze C-28 demethylation for activation and C-26 demethylation for inactivation of endogenous BRs. If the same enzymes catalyze both reactions, a reversible regulatory system which simultaneously turns on and off C-28 demethylation and C-26 demethylation is likely to be needed to maintain a steady-state level of endogenous BRs in a plant.

After soaking rice seeds in tap H 
2
O for 48 h, the seeds were selected and cultivated on 1% agar plates in darkness at 25 °C. Etiolated rice seedlings were grown for 7 days, and then uniform seedlings were selected. A segment ca. 4 cm in length from the shoot apex containing the second leaf lamina, the second lamina joint, and sheath was excised. These segments were floated on distilled H 
2
O for 24 h and uniformly bent segments were selected. Ten of the segments were incubated in a petri dish containing 20 ml distilled H 
2
O and a defined concentration of the test sample for 48 h under the same conditions. Finally, the magnitude of the angle induced between the lamina and the sheath was measured. Every operation was conducted under red light wavelength except the final angle-measurement step.
