Strigolactones (SLs) are a group of plant apocarotenoids that act as rhizosphere signaling molecules for both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and root parasitic plants. They also regulate plant architecture as phytohormones. The model legume

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Strigolactones (SLs) are a group of apocarotenoid compounds identified as germination stimulants of root parasitic plants about 50 years ago (

). They were later demonstrated to be rhizosphere signaling molecules for arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (

; 

) and to represent a new class of phytohormones regulating plant architecture, including shoot branching and several other aspects of shoot and root development (

; Umehara et al., 2008; 

; 

). To date, approximately 30 SLs have been characterized from root exudates of various plant species (

). Natural SLs are carotenoid-derived compounds consisting of an (

R

)-configurated methylbutenolide ring (D ring) linked by an enol ether bridge to a less conserved second moiety (

; 

; 

). SLs are classified into two groups, canonical and non-canonical SLs, according to their variable second moieties. Canonical SLs possess a 
C
19
basic skeleton consisting of a tricyclic lactone (ABC ring) and the enol-ether–D ring. They are further divided into strigol- and orobanchol-type SLs, which have an α- and a β-oriented 
C
ring, respectively. Non-canonical SLs contain the enol-ether–D ring moiety but lack the A, B, or 
C
ring. The different SL molecules may all display different biological activities when acting as symbiotic and parasitic signals as well as endogenous plant hormones (

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Much progress has been made over the past decade about biosynthesis of SLs. The sequential action of DWARF27 (D27), a carotenoid isomerase, CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE 7 (CCD7) and CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE 8 (CCD8) converts all- 
trans
- β-carotene to carlactone (
CL
) (

; 

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Arabidopsis thaliana
MAX
</tp:taxon-name>
1/CYP711A1 catalyzes three-step oxidations of the C-19 methyl group of 
CL
to 
<tp:taxon-name>form carlactonoic</tp:taxon-name>
acid (
CLA
) (

). In rice, one of MAX1 homologs, Os900 acts as a 
CL
oxidase to stereoselectively convert 
CL
to an orobanchol-type SL, 4-deoxyorobanchol (4DO), and another MAX1 homolog of rice, Os1400, as orobanchol synthase, converts 4DO to orobanchol (

). To determine which MAX1 reaction is conserved in the plant kingdom, the enzymatic function of MAX1 homologs in 
<tp:taxon-name>Arabidopsis</tp:taxon-name>
, rice, maize, tomato, poplar and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Selaginella moellendorffii
</tp:taxon-name>
were investigated (

; 

). The conversion of 
CL
to 
CLA
was found to be a common reaction catalyzed by MAX1 homologs. The ability of MAX1 homologs to metabolize 
CL
can be classified into 
three types
: A1- 
type
, converting 
CL
to 
CLA
; A2- 
type
, converting 
CL
to 4DO via 
CLA
; and A3- 
type
, converting 
CL
to 
CLA
and 4DO to orobanchol. A new compound, most likely 18-hydroxycarlactonoic acid ((2 
E
,3 
E
)-4-(2- (hydroxymethyl)-6,6-dimethylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl)-2-(((( 

R

)-4-methyl-5- oxo-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-yl)oxy)methylene)but-3-enoic acid, 18-OH-CLA) was identified as a metabolite of 
CL
by Os900, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Selaginella moellendorffii
MAX
</tp:taxon-name>
1 a/b and poplar MAX1 a/b. In the later stage of SL biosynthesis downstream of MAX1, 
<tp:taxon-name>Arabidopsis</tp:taxon-name>
produces methyl carlactonoate (MeCLA) from 
CLA
. MeCLA is further converted by LATERAL BRANCHING OXIDOREDUCTASE (LBO) enzyme to an unidentified SL-like compounds (

). LBO function may be involved to produce the major SL-type shoot branching hormone from MeCLA in the later steps of SL biosynthesis. In sorghum, a sulfotransferase, LOW GERMINATION STIMULANT 1 (LGS1), is likely to be involved in the formation of a strigol-type SL, 5-deoxystrigol (5 
DS
), by an unknown process (

). 3-Hydroxycarlactone was recently identified as an endogenous rice compound, which likely acts as an intermediate of SL biosynthesis (

).
</p>
         <p>
It has been presumed that the biosynthesis of 5 
DS
likely proceeds via the same mechanism with A2- 
type
MAX1s, but is catalyzed by homologs that 
<tp:taxon-name>form the</tp:taxon-name>
C
ring with the β-configuration (

; 

). However, a MAX1 homolog that converts 
CL
to 5 
DS
has not been discovered so far. It has remained elusive how strigol-type SLs are produced in plants. The conversion of 
CL
and 
CLA
to strigol-type SLs was shown by feeding experiments using sorghum, cotton and moonseed that are strigol-type SL producers (

).

<tp:taxon-name>

. LL lacks the C-ring and has a seven-membered cycloheptadiene A-ring as in medicaol, a major SL of

while LL is moderately active on the AM fungus. Among the basic SL biosynthesis pathway enzymes in 
<tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>L. japonicus</tp:taxon-name>

one MAX1 homolog (

) was found in the

genome assembly build 2.5 (
<tp:taxon-name>
Lotus japonicus

), but the function of the enzyme encoded by 
LjMAX1
has not yet been characterized. Considering the biochemical function of MAX1 homologs of various plants (

; 

, 

; 

), we hypothesized that LjMAX1 is required for the oxidation of 
CL
. In this study, to elucidate the enzymatic function of LjMAX 
1 in
SL biosynthesis, we performed 
in vitro
conversion of 
CL
and 
CLA
using a recombinant protein expressed in yeast microsomes. To confirm putative 18-OH-CLA that was detected as an LjMAX1 product, we chemically synthesized 18-OH-MeCLA and identified it by LC-MS/ 
MS
analysis. We then conducted feeding experiments with 
13
C-labeled 
CL
, 
CLA
and 18-OH-MeCLA to check whether these chemicals are precursors for 5

homolog (chr1.CM0133.560.r2.m in build 2.5 from the ecotype Miyakojima MG-20) in the biosynthesis of SLs, one 
LORE1
insertion mutant was obtained from the 
<tp:taxon-name>

Base mutant collection (

; 

; 

). In 
ljmax1
(line 
30101744
), the 
LORE1
retroelement was inserted in the first exon, 340 bp after the 
LjMAX1
start codon, leading to very low accumulation of 
LjMAX1
transcripts (
Fig. S1 A,B
). We analyzed the SL content in both WT and the 
ljmax1
mutant. We grew both genotypes in hydroponic solution without Pi to induce SL production. 5 
DS
and LL were detected in the root exudates of WT, but were not detected in those of the 
ljmax1
mutant (
Fig. S2
). These results demonstrated that LjMAX1 is the crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of 
<tp:taxon-name>

ljmax1
mutant did not show any excessive shoot branching phenotype unlike the previously described

To characterize the enzymatic function of LjMAX 
1 in
SL biosynthesis, we isolated the gene from

</tp:taxon-name>
ecotype 
Gifu
B-129. The corresponding full-length open reading frame was cloned by RT-PCR using total RNA prepared from seedling roots grown under Pi starvation. The open reading frame was 1617 bp encoding for a 539-amino acid protein (Table 
S
1). The amino acid sequence displayed 73% identity to 
<tp:taxon-name>Arabidopsis MAX</tp:taxon-name>
1 (
Fig. S3
). It was discovered that the LjMAX1 gene in the 
Gifu
B-129 ecotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. japonicus
</tp:taxon-name>
contains a singlebase pair substitution of cytosine to thymine at position 1119 when compared with the gene in the Miyakojima MG-20 ecotype (
Fig. S4
). This is a synonymous substitution leaving unaffected the identity of the corresponding amino acid residue glycine in position 373.

To characterize the conversion of CL by LjMAX1, the recombinant protein was expressed in yeast strain WAT11 which was engineered to co-produce ATR1 using the galactose-inducible 
GAL10-CYC1
promoter of yeast (

). The resulting microsomal fractions were incubated with either CL or CLA, and their metabolites were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. When incubated with CL, LjMAX1 produced significant levels of CLA but not 5DS (
Fig. 1
). Although 5DS was not detected as a metabolite of CLA, the CLA+16 Da putatively identified as 18-OH-CLA was detected at small levels (
Fig. 2
) (

). To confirm the inability of LjMAX1 to produce 5DS, we carried out feeding experiments with CL or CLA by 
in vivo
bioconversion using living yeast cells (

; 

). Both substrates did not yield the product 5DS (

2.3. Identification of the 
CLA
+16 Da as 18-OH-CLA

</title>
         <p>
To confirm the putative 18-OH-CLA, we synthesized 18-OH-MeCLA in eight steps (
Fig. 3
) starting from the triflate ester which was reduced with diisobutylaluminium hydride to give triflate alcohol. After protection of the hydroxyl group by a 
tert
-butyl(dimethyl)silyl (TBS) group, the resultant silyl-protected triflate was subjected to the Heck reaction with acrolein to afford TBSO-C 
12
-aldehyde. The silylated aldehyde was converted to TBSO-C 
13
-aldehyde via the Corey-Chaykovsky epoxidation with dimethylsulfonium methylide, followed by methylaluminium bis (4-bromo-2,6-di- 
tert
-butylphenoxide) (MABR)-promoted rearrangement of epoxide to aldehyde. The silylated 
C
13
-aldehyde was converted to the corresponding methyl ester with sodium cyanide and manganese oxide in methanol. Ester condensation of methyl ester with methyl formate followed by 
O
-alkylation with bromo-butenolide provided 18- TBSO-MeCLA. After purification by preparative HPLC, 18-TBSO-MeCLA was deprotected with aqueous acetic acid to afford 18-OH-MeCLA. The identity of 18-OH-CLA was confirmed by comparison of retention time and mass spectra of the methyl ester derivative of the Os900 product with those of the chemically synthesized standard in LC-MS/ 
MS
analysis (
Fig. 4
).

We expected that methyl ester could be hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic acid by non-specific esterases when fed to

]-18-OH-CLA was indeed detected in the root exudates of the WT plants when [10–

DS
whose 
m/z
is increased by one mass unit compared with an unlabeled authentic standard in [10– 
13
C

DS
, likely via [10– 
13
C
]-18-HO-CLA by 
<tp:taxon-name>

. We assumed that 18- OH-MeCLA is likely to be a precursor also for LL since this non-canonical SL has the B-ring and the methoxycarbonyl group. LC-MS/

analysis of the above exudates revealed that 
13
C-label was incorporated into LL (

         <p>
The deficiency of 5 
DS
and LL production in the 

<tp:taxon-name>L. japonicus max</tp:taxon-name>
1

mutant is similar to those described for mutants in MAX1 homologs in rice, 
<tp:taxon-name>Arabidopsis</tp:taxon-name>
and tomato (

; 

; 

). This indicates that LjMAX1 (CYP711A9) is the crucial enzyme for SL biosynthesis in 

<tp:taxon-name>L. japonicus</tp:taxon-name>
.

By yeast heterologous expression and chemical synthesis, we demonstrated that LjMAX1 (CYP711A9) converts 
CL
via 
CLA
to18-OH-CLA but not to 5 
DS
. The inability of LjMAX1 to produce 5 
DS
from 
CL
was confirmed by feeding experiments using recombinant enzymes expressed in microsomes and cells. Therefore, 18-OH-CLA appears to be an end-product by LjMAX1, being classified this enzyme to the A1- 
type
MAX1s such as PtMAX1a and PtMAX1b (

).

Surprisingly, despite its SL deficiency, the 
ljmax1
mutant did not show any excessive shoot branching phenotype unlike the previously described 
max1
mutants of various plant species. This 
LORE1
insertion line 
30101744
has another exonic insertion in a gene predicted to encode EIN3-binding F-box protein 1-like that is unlikely to be involved in SL-related phenotypes. In addition to the LjMAX1 (CYP711A9), the putative second MAX1 homolog (Lj 
5g

<tp:taxon-name>

The cation-initiated cascade cyclization for constructing the BC ring system of SLs developed by 

made a prediction for an intermediate 18-OH-CLA in the enzymatic conversion of 
CL
to 4DO by Os900 (

; 

; 

). In our previous study, we detected a new product 
CLA
+16 Da in the reaction of Os900 with 
CL
and 
CLA
(

). The profile of the product ions of 18-OH-CL metabolite by Os900 was the same as that of 
CLA
+16 Da. These results allowed us to predict that the chemical structure of 
CLA
+16 Da might be 18-OH-CLA. This putative metabolite was produced from 
CL
by SmMAX1a, SmMAX1b, PtMAX1a and PtMAX1b, and also from 
CLA
by the four MAX1s and LjMAX1. In this study, we synthesized 18-OH-MeCLA and compared its chemical properties with 
CL

MS
. Thus, we unambiguously identified 
CLA
+16 Da to be 18-OH-CLA.

         <p>
In this study, we showed in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. japonicus
</tp:taxon-name>
that (11 

R

)- 
CL
exists endogenously, and that (11 

R

)- 
CL
is stereospecifically converted to (2′ 

R

)- (+)-5 
DS
. The endogenous presence of (11 

R

)- 
CL
has been reported in 
<tp:taxon-name>Arabidopsis</tp:taxon-name>
and rice (

). In rice, (11 

R

)- 
CL
is converted to (−)-4DO and (−)-orobanchol in a stereospecific manner. In sorghum, cotton, moonseed and cowpea, the stereospecific conversion of (11 

R

)- 
CL
to their respective strigol- and orobanchol-type SLs was demonstrated (

). In tomato, biochemically prepared 
CL
(

) was converted to its canonical SLs, orobanchol, 
ent
-2′- epiorobanchol and solanacol, and also to the three putative didehydroorobanchol isomers (

).
</p>
         <p>
18-OH-CLA which we identified as an end-product by LjMAX1 is likely to be a precursor for 5 
DS
biosynthesis in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. japonicus
</tp:taxon-name>
. This is likely to be the case for the 4DO biosynthesis of popular whose two MAX1 homologs produce 18-OH-CLA as an end-product (

). To support this hypothesis, we show that 18-OH-CLA is produced from 
CLA
in planta
by feeding experiments and also that 18-OH-CLA is endogenously present in the root exudates of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. japonicus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 18-OH-MeCLA is converted to 5 
DS
and LL 
in planta
by feeding experiments. Taken together, these data are first to demonstrate that 18-hydroxylated carlactonoates are the intermediates for canonical and non-canonical SL biosynthesis.
</p>
         <p>
Probable cyclization mechanisms for the two different 5 
DS
and LL ring systems from 18-hydroxylated carlactonoates can be explained by the hypothesis for the ring formation reaction (

). The bioconversion of [10– 
13
C
]-18-OH-MeCLA to [6′- 
13
C
]-5 
DS
presumably proceeded via the corresponding carboxylic acid [10– 
13
C
]-18- OH-CLA. The single concerted mechanism applied to 18-OH-CLA may 
<tp:taxon-name>form the</tp:taxon-name>
BC-ring of 5 
DS
as proposed for the formation of 4DO from 
CL
via 18-OH-CLA by Os900 (
Fig. S8
) (

; 

). The inability of 18-OH-CLA-producing MAX1 homolog enzymes such as LjMAX1, and PtMAX1a and PtMAX1b to catalyze closure of the BC-ring may be caused by their inability to activate the allylic alcohol substrate to intramolecular nucleophilic cyclization. LL contains the AB-ring but lacks the C-ring. This 
C
20-
skeleton compound has been presumed to be derived from MeCLA or its isomers and their oxygenated derivatives (

). Given the fact that the corresponding free acids of natural non-canonical SLs (except for 
CLA
) have not been discovered, the bioconversion of [10– 
13
C
]-18-OH-MeCLA to [6′- 
13
C
]-LL presumably proceeded without hydrolysis of methyl ester. Therefore, the stepwise mechanism is applicable to explain the formation of the B ring in LL from 18-OH-MeCLA (
Fig. S8
) (

).

4. Concluding remarks
</title>
         <p>
In this study, we showed that LjMAX1 (CYP711A9) is the crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lotus
</tp:taxon-name>
SLs and that 18-hydroxylated carlactonoates are possible precursors for SL biosynthesis in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. japonicus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. 8
). Considering the structure of 18-hydroxylated carlactonoates and the mechanisms of cyclization reaction, the downstream enzyme(s) involved in 5 
DS
biosynthesis might catalyze protonation of the hydroxyl and a stereocontrolled cyclization of B- and β-oriented C-ring accompanied by the loss of a water molecule. LL is a highly decorated SL, and multiple enzymes should be included in its biosynthesis from 18-hydroxylated carlactonoates (
Fig. S8
). Our discovery will further contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis for the structural diversity in SLs.

To a solution of trimethylsulfonium iodide (3.0 g, 14.7 mmol) in DMSO (12 ml) was added THF (12 ml) under Ar to yield a finely divided suspension of sulfonium salt. This mixture was then cooled to 0 ° 
C
and treated with a solution of dimsyl sodium (4.4 
M
, 4.1 ml, 18.0 mmol). The resulting gray colored suspension was treated with a solution of aldehyde 
5
(
3.12 g
, 10.1 mmol) in THF (1.6 ml). After stirring at 0 ° 
C
for 1 h, the mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 15 min. The reaction mixture was quenched with water and extracted with 
n
-hexane. The organic phase was washed with water, dried over anhydrous Na

The 5-wk-old plants were transferred to Falcon tubes (50 ml) containing 40 ml tap water with 1 μM [10– 
13
C]-18-OH-MeCLA and 10 μM fluridone and 0.02% acetone and were grown for an additional 2 days. Control plants were grown in the same volume of tap water containing 0.02% acetone. The culture media were passed through Oasis HLB column 1 cc, and eluted with 3 ml 90% acetone/water with 0.1% acetic acid. The eluates were concentrated to water, and the residues were extracted with ethyl acetate twice. The ethyl acetate phase was concentrated to dryness under nitrogen gas, dissolved immediately in acetonitrile and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using UHPLC (Nexera X2; Shimadzu) and a triple quadrupole/linear ion trap instrument (LIT) (QTRAP5500; AB SCIEX) as above.
