         <p>ABSTRACT</p>
         <p>
Intestinal commensal fungi are vital to human health, and their metabolites play a key role in the reciprocal relationship. In the present work, eighteen alkaloids and seven monoterpenoids were isolated from the fermentation of the human intestinal fungus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Penicillium oxalicum
SL
</tp:taxon-name>
2, including seven undescribed alkaloids (penicilloxalines A-G), three undescribed monoterpenoids (penicilloxalines H-J), and fifteen reported compounds. The structures of the isolated compounds were identified by HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, electronic circular dichroism spectra and quantum chemical calculations. Some metabolites displayed moderate agonistic effects against the pregnane X receptor (PXR), whereas (6 
R
)3,7-dimethyl-6,7-dihydroxy-2(
Z
)-octenoic acid displayed a significant agonistic effect against the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) with an EC 
50
value of 0.43 
μ
M, which was verified by investigating FXR downstream target genes and proteins, such as small heterodimer partner 1 (SHP1), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and bile salt export pump (BSEP).

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms establish an intestinal microbiome in mammals (

; 

). Metabolites and metabolic signals of intestinal microorganisms are beneficial for defining the trajectory toward host health or disease, especially early in life (

; 

; 

). Some studies have demonstrated that changes in the microbiome are associated with host physiological disorders and increased susceptibility to inflammation and metabolic and neurogenic diseases (

; 

). For example, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Saccharomyces boulardii
</tp:taxon-name>
is a yeast probiotic that is able to prevent and treat pathogenic bacterial infections and intestinal complications (

). To date, studies on gut microbiota have mainly focused on bacteria; however, intestinal fungi are an integral part of a wide variety of human gut microbial environments, and their functional ecological role in human gut microbiomes is still unclear (

). Therefore, enhancing the study of metabolites of intestinal fungi is very important to elucidate the underlying relationship between gut fungi and the host (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Penicillium
</tp:taxon-name>
is a cosmopolite ascomycetous fungus widely distributed in marine and terrestrial environments, as well as in the human gut. This genus comprises more than 300 species, and some species are capable of elaborating metabolites with peculiar structural features and significant biological activities, including alkaloids (e.g., penazaphilones A–I) (

), sesquiterpene coumarins (e.g., penisarins A and B) (

), cyclic peptides (psychrophilins B and C) (

), and polyketides (e.g., minolutelides A and B, sclerotiorin, and citrofulvicin) (

; 

). Some metabolites display anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and anti-osteoporotic activities, as well as the inhibition of lipoxygenase-1 (

; 

; 

), which has attracted attention from pharmacists and chemists.

Herein, the metabolites investigation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Penicillium oxalicum
Currie, J.N.
</tp:taxon-name>
; Thom, C. (
<tp:taxon-name>Trichocomaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) strain SL2, produced twenty-five compounds, including ten undescribed penicilloxalines A-J and fifteen known penicilloxalines (
Fig. 1
). Their structures were determined by 1D and 2D NMR, HRESIMS, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra as well as time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) ECD calculations. All the isolated compounds were assayed for their agonistic effects toward pregnane X receptor (PXR) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Molecular dynamics (MD) was used to further study the underlying interaction of compound 
18
with FXR.

2.1. Structure determination of isolated metabolites
</title>
         <p>
Penicilloxaline A (

) was isolated as an amorphous powder, and its molecular formula was determined to be C 
27
H 
39
N 
3
O

based on its HRESIMS ion at 
m/z
452.2926 [M H] (calcd. for C

N 
3
O 
3
, 452.2919) and 
13
C NMR data. The 
1
H NMR data of 
1
(
Table 1
) revealed the presence of a tri-substituted benzene ring at 
δ
H
values of 7.34 (1H, d, 
J
= 7.6 Hz, H-4), 6.98 (1H, d, 
J
= 7.6 Hz, H-6), and 6.91 (1H, t, 
J
= 7.6 Hz, H-5), one 
N
-methyl group at 
δ
H
2.46 (1H, s, 
CH
3
-18), and three methyl groups at 
δ
H
1.15 (1H, s, 
CH
3
-28), 0.90 (1H, s, 
CH
3
-23), and 0.77 (1H, s, 
CH
3
-22). The 
13
C NMR data (
Table 1
) showed 27 carbon signals, including one amide carbonyl carbon at a 
δ
C
181.0, six aromatic carbons at 
δ
C
142.5, 130.2, 129.7, 123.8, 121.3, and 120.7, two oxygenated carbons at 
δ
C
75.7 and 73.2, three nitrogenated carbons at 
δ
C
63.3, 54.8, and 49.7, one 
N
-methyl caron at 
δ
C
28.7, and three methyl carbons at 
δ
C
24.5, 23.2, and 22.8. Comparison of the

01-1 (

) indicated differences at C-18, C-25, and C-26. The chemical shift values of C-25 and C-26 were deshielded from 
δ
C
values of 60.1 and 
55.6 in
penioxalamine A to 
δ
C
75.7 and 
73.2 in
1
(

), and the C-18 chemical shift value was shielded from 
δ
C
174.7 in
penioxalamine A to 
δ
C
28.7 in
1
(

). The HMBC correlations of 
CH
3
-28 with C-25/C-26 and the shift values of C-25 (
δ
C
75.7) and C-26 (
δ
C
73.2) suggested the locations of two hydroxyl groups at C-25 and C-26 (
Fig. 2
). The HMBC correlation of 
CH
3
-18 with C-11 revealed that the 
N
-methyl group was linked at C- 
11 in
a combination of the proton signal of the 
N
-methyl group (
δ
H
2.46, s). In the NOESY spectrum of 
1
, cross-peaks of 
CH
3
-28 with 
CH
3
-22/H-25, H-20 with 
CH
3
-22/H-13, and 
CH
3
-23 with H-4/ 
CH
3
-18 suggested 
α
-orientations of 
CH
3
-18, OH-25, and OH-26, 
β
-orientations of H-13, H-20, and 
CH
3
-28 (
Fig. 3
), and a (
R

1
, quantum chemical calculations were applied based on DFT. The calculated ECD spectrum of (3 
R

R
,13 
S
,20 
S
,25 
S
,26 
S
)- 
1
at the CAM-B3LYP/def-tzvp level agreed with its experimental ECD spectrum (
Fig. 4A
), demonstrating the (3 
R

R
,13 
S
,20 
S

S
)-configuration of 
1
. Accordingly, the structure of 
1
is shown in 
Fig. 1
and is referred to as penicilloxaline A.
</p>
         <p>
The molecular formula of penicilloxaline B (
2
) was determined to be C 
13
H 
14
N 
2
O 
6
according to its HRESIMS data at 
m/z
293.0779 [M H] (calcd. for C 
13
H 
13
N 
2
O 
6
, 293.0779) and 
13
C NMR data. The 
1
H NMR data (
Table 2
) for 
2
displayed the presence of two substituted benzene rings at 
δ
H
7.86 (1H, dd, 
J
= 7.9, 1.5 Hz), 7.68 (1H, dd, 
J
= 8.5, 1.5 Hz), 7.53 (1H, td, 
J
= 8.5, 1.5 Hz), and 6.92 (1H, dd, 
J
= 7.9, 1.5 Hz), and a methoxy group at 
δ
H
3.60 (1H, s). The 
13
C NMR data (
Table 2
) for 
2
showed 13 carbon resonances, including three carbonyl carbons at 
δ
C
173.0, 168.4, and 163.4, six aromatic carbons at 
δ
C
145.9, 134.2, 131.2, 119.6, 113.2, and 112.2, an olefinic carbon at 
δ
C
131.4, and a methoxy group at 
δ
C
51.2. The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data of 
2
were similar to those of penipacid C (
19
) isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. paneum
</tp:taxon-name>
SD-44 (

), with the exception that 
2
had three carbons (
δ
C
173.0, 51.2, and 30.3) more than 
19
and the chemical shift value of C-12 was deshielded from 
δ
C
11.4 in
19
to 
δ
C
29.1 in
2
(

), indicating their differences mainly at the side chain of C-12. This deduction was further confirmed through an HMBC experiment showing correlations of H 
2
-12 with C-11/C-14, H-13 with C-9, and OCH 
3
-14 with C-14 (
Fig. 2
). Therefore, the structure of 
2
was defined as shown in 
Fig. 1
and is referred to as penicilloxaline B.
</p>
         <p>
Penicilloxaline C (
3
) had the molecular formula C 
13
H 
14
N 
2
O 
6
based on its HRESIMS (
m/z
293.0781 [M H], calcd. for C 
13
H 
13
N 
2
O 
6
, 293.0779) and 
13
C NMR data (
Table 2
). The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data of 
3
closely resembled those of 
2
, except for the downfield shift of C-11 from 
δ
C
163.4 in
2
to 
δ
C
161.9 in
3
, the upfield shift of C-14 from 
δ
C
173.0 in 
2
to 
δ
C
173.9 in
3
, and the signals of the methoxy group [
δ
C
51.2 and 
δ
H
3.60 (s) in 
2
; 
δ
C
51.9 and 
δ
H
3.82 (s) in 
3
], suggesting their differences at C-11 and C-14. The HMBC correlations of OCH 
3
-11 with C-11 confirmed their differences. Thus, the structure of 
3
was determined to be penicilloxaline C.
</p>
         <p>
Analysis of HRESIMS data of penicilloxaline D (
4
) revealed that 
4
possessed a molecular formula of C 
14
H 
16
N 
2
O 

6
in

conjunction with its 
13
C NMR data. The signals of the two methoxy groups were 
δ
C
51.9 and 52.0 and 
δ
H
3.59 (s) and 3.76 (s) in the 
1
H NMR spectrum of 
4
, and 
4
had a mass that was 14 Da greater than 
3
, revealing that 
4
was a methylated derivative of 
3
. In the HMBC spectrum of 
4
, cross-peaks of OCH 
3
-14 with C-14 and OCH 
3
-11 with C-11 confirmed the linkages of two methoxy moieties. The structure of 
4
is shown in 
Fig. 1
and is referred to as D.
</p>
         <p>
Penicilloxaline E (
5
) was obtained as an amorphous powder, and its molecular formula was determined to be C 
17
H 
14
N 
2
O 
4
based on the HRESIMS data (
m/z
309.0886 [M H], calcd. for C 
17
H 
13
N 
2
O 
4
, 309.0881). The 
1
H NMR data of 
5
displayed the presence of a quinazolinone moiety at 
δ
H
8.10 (1H, s), 8.09 (1H, br d, 
J
= 7.5 Hz), 7.80 (1H, br t, 
J
= 7.5 Hz), 7.60 (1H, br d, 
J
= 7.5 Hz), and 7.52 (1H, br t, 
J
= 7.5 Hz) in combination with the characteristic 
13
C NMR data (
δ
C
159.9, 147.4 × 2, 134.5, 127.1, 126.9, 126.1, and 121.2) (
Table 3
). Four aromatic protons were present at 
δ
H
6.90 (2H, d, 
J
= 8.2 Hz) and 
δ
H
6.54 (2H, d, 
J
= 8.2 Hz) in the 
1
H NMR spectrum of 
5
, and signals of nine representative carbons were present at 
δ
C
170.5, 155.9, 129.7 × 2, 126.9, 115.2 × 2, 59.9, and 
33.9 in
its 
13
C NMR spectrum, which suggested the presence of a tyrosine moiety. The presence of the two abovementioned moieties was further confirmed by the 2D NMR data of 
5
. The HMBC correlations of H-12 with C-1/C-9 determined the linkage of a quinazolinone and tyrosine moiety through a nitrogen atom (
Fig. 3
). The calculated ECD spectrum of (12 
S
)- 
5
agreed well with its experimental ECD spectrum, requiring its absolute configuration (
Fig. 4B
). Accordingly, the structure of 
5
is shown in 
Fig. 1
and is referred to as penicilloxaline E (
5
).
</p>
         <p>
Penicilloxaline F (
6
) had a molecular formula of C 
17
H 
14
N 
2
O 
5
according to the [M H] peak at 
m/z
325.0819 (calcd. for C 
17
H 
13
N 
2
O 
5
, 325.0824) and 
13
C NMR data. The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data of 
6
closely resembled those of 
5
, and their difference was at the right aromatic ring (
Table 3
). The chemical shift value of C-16 was deshielded from 
δ
C
115.2 in
5
to 
δ
C
145.1 in
6
, and the chemical shift values of C-15, C-17, and C-19 were shielded from 
δ
C
129.8, 156.1, and 
129.8 in
5
to 
δ
C
116.1, 143.8, and 
119.4 in
6
. The HMBC correlation of H-18 with C-16 suggested the hydrolyzation of C-16. The absolute configuration of 
6
was assigned as 12 
S
through a comparison of its calculated and experimental ECD spectra (
Fig. 4C
). Thus, the structure of 
6
was defined in 
Fig. 1
and referred to as penicilloxaline F (
6
).
</p>
         <p>
The molecular formula of penicilloxaline G (
7
) was determined to be C 
18
H 
16
N 
2
O 
4
based on the HRESIMS and 
13
C NMR data. Comparison of the 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data of 
7
and 
5
revealed the presence of a methoxy group [
δ
C
52.6; 
δ
H
3.69, s] in 
7
and the upfield shift of C-11 from 
δ
C
170.5 in
5 to 
δ
C
169.3 in
7
. The HMBC cross-peaks of OCH 
3
-11 with C-11 suggested that 
7
was a methylation derivative of 
5
. Its absolute configuration was determined to be 12 
S
based on the result of the quantum chemical calculation (
Fig. 4D
). Therefore, the structure of 
7
is shown in 
Fig. 1
and is referred to as penicilloxaline G.
</p>
         <p>
HRESIMS and 
13
C NMR data analysis of penicilloxaline H (
8
) indicated that its molecular formula was C 
14
H 
24
O 
6
. Comparison of the 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data of 
8
and (
Z
, 
R
)-3,7-dimethyl-oct-2- ene-1,6,7-triol revealed the presence of a succinic acid moiety [
δ
C
173.7, 172.1, 28.9, and 28.8] and the downfield shift of C-1 from 
δ
C
57.5 in
(
Z
, 
R
)-3,7- dimethyl-oct-2-ene-1,6,7-triol to 
δ
C
60.6 in
8
(

), which suggests that 
8
was a succinylation derivative of the known compound. This deduction was confirmed by the HMBC experiment (
Fig. 2
). The configuration of the Δ 
2(3)
olefinic moiety was determined as the (
Z
)-configuration based on NOESY cross-peaks of H-2 with 
CH
3
-9 and H 
2
-1 with H-4a (
Fig. 3
). The optical rotation of 
8
was similar to that of (
Z
, 
R
)-3,7-dimethyl-oct-2-ene-1,6,7-triol (

), requiring a (6 
R
)-configuration.
</p>
         <p>
Penicilloxaline I (
9
) was assigned a molecular formula of C 
10
H 
18
O 
5
based on its HRESIMS ion at 
m/z
217.1074 ([M H] calcd. for C 
10
H 
17
O 
5
, 217.1076) and 
13
C NMR data (
Table 4
). The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data of 
9
closely resembled those of (6 
S
)-3,7-dimethyl-6,7-dihydroxy-2 (
Z
)-octenoic acid (
15
) (

). The downfield shift of C-8 from 
δ
C
24.7 in
(6 
S
)-3,7-dimethyl-6,7-dihydroxy-2(
Z
)-octenoic acid (
15
) to 
δ
C
66.2 (
9
) suggested the location of a hydroxy group at C-8 (

), which was further confirmed through an HMBC experiment showing correlations of 
CH
3
-10 with C-8. The configuration of the Δ 
2(3)
olefinic moiety in 
9
was the same as that of 
8
described by the NOESY correlations of 
CH
3
-9 with H-2. Thus, the structure of penicilloxaline I (
9
) was identified as shown in 
Fig. 1
.
</p>
         <p>
The molecular formula of penicilloxaline J (
10
) was defined as C 
10
H 
16
O 
4
by HRESIMS and 
13
C NMR data. A detailed comparison of the 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data of 
10
and (6 
S
)-3,7-dimethyl-6,7-dihydroxy-2(
Z
)- octenoic acid (
15
) demonstrated that 
10
was a 6-oxo derivative of 
15
because of the downfield shift of C-6 from 
δ
C
72.7 in
15
to 
δ
C
215.0 in 
10
(

). In the HMBC spectrum of 
10
, correlations of 
CH
3
-8/ 
CH
3
-10 with C-6 confirmed the deduction. The configuration of the Δ 
2(3)
olefinic moiety in 
10
was identical to that of 
8
and 
9
according to similar 
13
C NMR data and the biosynthetic background. Therefore, the structure of penicilloxaline J (
10
) was determined as shown in 
Fig. 1
.

2.2. Agonistic effects of isolated metabolites against PXR and FXR
</p>
         <p>
These isolated compounds were assayed for their agonistic effects against PXR and FXR. Compounds 
5
, 
11
, 
19
, and 
22
exhibited significant agonistic effects against PXR with EC 
50
values of 7.73, 4.04, 0.12, and 0.21 
μ
M, respectively, whereas compound 
18
displayed a significant agonistic effect against FXR with an EC 
50
value of 0.43 
μ
M (
Table 5
).
</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>
To confirm the agonistic effect of compound 
18
toward FXR, the mRNA and protein expression levels of FXR and its downstream targets, such as SHP1, BSEP, and FGF, were investigated after 24 h incubation of compound 
18
(2 
μ
M) with HepG2 cells. As shown in 
Fig. 5A–C
, administration of compound 
18
(2 
μ
M) resulted in the upregulation of the mRNA levels of FXR, SHP1, and BSEP, and expression levels of FXR, SHP1, FGF, and BSEP were increased after the administration of compound 
18
(2 
μ
M). FXR is a nuclear transcription factor, and its nuclear translocation leads to the binding of its downstream target genes; therefore, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of FXR modulated by compound 
18
. As described in 
Fig. 6
, the translocation of FXR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was observed after treatment with compound 
18
. These results indicate that compound 
18
activated FXR and transcriptionally regulated the expression levels of its downstream targets.
</p>
         <p>
To investigate the potential interaction of compound 
18
with FXR, GROMACS software was used to perform a 50-ns MD stimulation. As shown in 
Fig. 7A–C
, the RMSD of compound 
18
with FXR remained under 2 Å, the RMSF of residues ranged from 0.5 Å to 3.5 Å, and the pocket volume of FXR remained at approximately 1000 Å 

3
in

the presence of compound 
18
during a 50-ns MD stimulation, which suggests that this MD stimulation was reliable. Compound 
18
could form a stable complex with FXR with an energy of approximately 5.8 × 10 
5
kJ/mol during a 50-ns MD stimulation (
Fig. 7D
). The total binding energy was 78.383 kJ/mol, indicating that compound 
18
had a good binding effect with FXR. The energy contribution results indicated that the van der Waals interaction energy (177.442 kJ/mol) was strong, the electrostatic (35.666 kJ/mol) and SASA nonpolar solvent (13.918 kJ/mol) interaction energy was weak, and polar solvation (88.643 kJ/mol) hindered the binding of compound 
18
and FXR (
Fig. 7E
). During the 50- ns MD stimulation, Compound 
18
could form 1–4 hydrogen bonds with four amino acid residues, Val325, Met328, Phe329, Ser332, and Tyr369 (
Fig. 7F
). The distances of compound 
18
with amino acid residues Val325, Met328, Phe329, and Tyr369 were monitored by GROMACS. As shown in 
Fig. 7G, a
complex of compound 
18
with FXR achieved equilibrium during the 50-ns MD stimulation, whereas Ser332 maintained a distance under 3.0 Å with OH-6 and OH-7 of compound 
18
(
Fig. 7H
) after the 50-ns MD stimulation. During the 50-ns MD stimulation (
Fig. 8A
), compound 
18
only interacted with Ser332 by way of two hydrogen bonds, indicating the potential role of Ser 
332 in
the agonistic effect of compound 
18
toward FXR.

Analysis of the 3D crystal structure of FXR (PDB code: 3BEJ) revealed that this protein (Q96RI1-2, NM_005123) is one of five FXR isoforms (Q96RI1-1, Q96RI1-2, Q96RI1-3, Q96RI1-4, and Q96RI1-5) based on the UniProt database (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96RI1), while the FXR plasmid used in this study was cloned from Q96RI1-4 (NM_001206992). A comparison of the amino acid sequences of Q96RI1-2 and Q96RI1-4 suggests that the former possesses ten fewer amino acids than the latter, as previously described (

, 

). On the basis of this analysis, a site-directed amino acid mutation was carried out. The S342V mutation abolished the agonistic effect of compound 
18
toward FXR (
Fig. 8B
), which further reveals the agonistic effect of compound 
18
toward FXR through the hydrogen bond interaction with amino acid residue Ser332.

compounds (1

seven previously undescribed alkaloid penicilloxalines A 
¡
G (

1 
–
7

), three previously undescribed monoterpenoid penicilloxalines H-J (

8 
–
10

), and fifteen reported compounds (

11 
–
25

). Compounds 
5
, 
11
, 
19
, and 
22
displayed significant agonist effects against PXR with EC 
50
values from 0.12 
¡7.73
μ
M, whereas compound 
18
gave a significant agonist effect against FXR (EC 
50
= 0.43 
μ
M). MD stimulation revealed hydrogen bonds between the Ser332 amino acid residue of FXR and the 6-OH and 7-OH of compound 
18
. Site-directed amino acid mutation confirmed the vital role of Ser 
332 in
the agonistic effect of compound 
18
toward FXR. Therefore, the hydroxyl groups of compound 
18
were revealed as the active functional groups of compound 
18
.
