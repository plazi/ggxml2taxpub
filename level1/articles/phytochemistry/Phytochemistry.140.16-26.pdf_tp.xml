1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Specialized metabolites from fungal endophytes have emerged as potential new sources for previously undescribed bioactive compounds. In some cases, it is known that such compounds play an important role in the chemical ecology of host plants and in their defense mechanisms against pathogens and insect herbivory (

; Strobel, 2003). While endophytes from fescue grasses have been well studied, there is limited information on the endophytes of agriculturally important flowering plants, including their specialized metabolites. A few examples of these plant families include the 
<tp:taxon-name>Rosaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(raspberry, genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rubus
</tp:taxon-name>
), 
<tp:taxon-name>Vitaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(grapevine, genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Vitis
</tp:taxon-name>
), and 
<tp:taxon-name>Ericaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(blueberry and cranberry, genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Vaccinium
</tp:taxon-name>
) (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
In earlier studies, it was shown that conifer endophytes produce a number of specialized metabolites that are toxic agents to the spruce budworm and provide protection to seedlings against deforestation pests (

, 

). Insights into the chemical ecology of a pine-blueberry forest ecotype were also gained. As reported, the potent antifungal agent griseofulvin was produced by endophytic 
<tp:taxon-name>
Xylaria
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, isolated from white pine (
<tp:taxon-name>
Pinus strobus
</tp:taxon-name>
) needles and low bush blueberries (
<tp:taxon-name>
Vaccinium angustifolium
</tp:taxon-name>
), demonstrating that the lifecycles of fungi and plant microbiomes are more complex than previously thought (

).
</p>
         <p>
Expanding on these efforts, previously undescribed diplosporin and agistatine derivatives produced from an endophytic 
<tp:taxon-name>
Xylaria
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
, isolated from a Concord grape leaf (
<tp:taxon-name>
Vitis labrusca
</tp:taxon-name>
) were reported (

). The yearly production of grapes in 
Canada
is approximately 
81,000 metric tonnes
, of which 95% are from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Vitis vinifera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 5% from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Vitis labrusca
</tp:taxon-name>
(Agriculture and 

). The production of organic grapes has also increased significantly over the past decade in 
Canada
and globally, with increasing concern for crop protection against disease and insect pests without the use of synthetic pesticides (

; 

; 

). These findings spurred further investigation into the specialized metabolites of endophytic fungi from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Vitis vinifera
</tp:taxon-name>
and their biological activity. In total, seven endophytes were recovered from the grapevines and leaves of Riesling grape, maintained in a fungicide free area located on 
Jordan
Research Farm (Agriculture and Agri-food 
Canada
). ITS DNA sequencing identified a number of taxa including 

<tp:taxon-name>Anthostomella, Coniothyrium</tp:taxon-name>
ferrarisianum, Creosphaeria sassafra, 
<tp:taxon-name>Hypoxylon submonticulosum</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>
Nemania serpens
(Pers.) Grey (1821)
</tp:taxon-name>
, in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Xylariaceae</tp:taxon-name>

bacteria in preliminary screening.
</p>
         <p>
This study reports herein the isolation and characterization of ten previously undescribed (
1‾10
) and four known (
11‾14
) specialized metabolites from the endophytic fungus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Nemania serpens
</tp:taxon-name>
and (

<tp:taxon-name>Mollisia nigrescens</tp:taxon-name>
.

Epoxynemanione A (
1
) is a previously undescribed polyketide metabolite with a bicyclic ring system, containing two oxymethine groups, a pyrone ring and a unique epoxide moiety, structurally similar to the antifungal compound epoxyroussoeone (

). Nemanifuranones A 
‾
F (
2‾7
) are a previously undescribed series of specialized metabolites containing a rare C2 hemiacetal within the 4- methyl-5-alkenyl- and alkane -3(2H)-furanone ring system, exhibiting shortened alkyl chains and furanone-lactone coupled derivatives. Nemanilactones A 
‾
C (
8‾10
) are previously undescribed lactone polyketides, including lactone-lactone derivatives (
Fig. 1
). The isolated compounds were tested for preliminary biological activity against a panel of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including several yeasts.

The endophytic fungus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Nemania serpens
(Pers.) Grey (1821)
</tp:taxon-name>
was isolated from the surface sterilized grapevines and leaves of Riesling 
<tp:taxon-name>variety grape</tp:taxon-name>
plants located at 
Jordan
Research Farms in 
Ontario
, 
Canada
. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Canadian Collection of Fungal Cultures (CCFC) as DAOMC 251481 and the sequence data was deposited in GenBank (accession # KY713249). Epoxynemanione A (
1
), nemanifuranones A 
‾
F (
2‾7
) and nemanilactones A 
‾
C (
8‾10
) were isolated from the culture filtrates by ethyl acetate extraction. The ethyl acetate extract was subjected to semi-preparative reversed-phase 
<tp:taxon-name>HPLC</tp:taxon-name>
fractionation yielding metabolites 
1‾2
, 
4
, and 
8
. Metabolites

required a second semi-preparative reversed-phase

purification to resolve co-eluting peaks.
</p>
         <p>
Epoxynemanione A (
1
) was isolated as a golden-brown solid. Its HRESIMS afforded the molecular ion at 
m/z
227.0810, and a more abundant sodium adduct ion at 
m/z
249.0736 (C 
11
H 
14
O 
5
Na), thus establishing its molecular formula as C 
11
H 
14
O 
5
indicative of 5 double bond equivalents (SI 
Fig.1
). The 
1
H NMR spectrum (
Table 1
) indicated the presence of two olefinic methine protons at 
d
7.48 (d, 
J
¼ 6.4 Hz) and 
d
5.60 (d, 
J
¼ 6.4 Hz), two oxymethine protons at 
d
4.10 (dd, 
J
¼ 9.4, 5.9 Hz) and 
d
3.93 (d, 
J
¼ 7.9 Hz), a methine at 
d
1.14 (m), two methylene groups at 
d
1.63a, 1.13b (dq, 
J
¼ 12.5, 7.4 Hz, m) and 
d
1.84a, 1.07b (ddd, 
J
¼ 13.2, 5.9, 2.0 Hz, ddd, 
J
¼ 13.2, 11.5, 9.4 Hz) and a methyl group at 
d
0.83 (t, 
J
¼ 7.3 Hz). Examination of the 
13
C DEPTq and multiplicity edited HSQC indicated compound (
1
) possessed 11 carbon atoms. Resonances were attributed to a carbonyl group at C4 (189.3 ppm), a ring epoxide system at C4a/C8a (68.4 and 89.8 ppm), two oxymethine protons at C5 and C8 (64.7, 66.4 ppm), two methylenes at C6 and C9 (32.7, 23.5 ppm), three methines at C2, C3 and C7 (157.5, 106.8, 36.3 ppm) and a methyl group at C10 (10.9 ppm). A pyrone ring system was evident from OE/ β carbon assignments of the two olefinic methines at H2 [
d
7.48 (d, 
J
¼ 6.4 Hz)] and H3 [
d
5.60 (d, 
J
¼ 6.4 Hz)] being conjugated to the carbonyl group and both showed COSY connectivity. An HMBC correlation further supported the pyrone ring systems with connectivities of H2 to C8a, H3 to C4a and to the C4 carbonyl, thus accounting for three degrees of unsaturation (
Fig. 2
). The presence of only two other quaternary carbons at C4a and C8a indicated an epoxide ring system neighboring the two oxymethines, with a 1,4- substituted configuration. A second ring system accounted for the two remaining degrees of unsaturation and was established from the key HMBC correlations of the oxymethine proton at H5 [
d
4.10 (dd, 
J
¼ 9.4, 5.9 Hz)] to C4a, C6 and C7, and the second oxymethine proton H8 [
d
3.93 (d, 
J
¼ 7.9 Hz)] to the methine at C7 and methylene at C9. The methyl triplet group at H10 [
d
0.83 (t, 
J
¼ 7.3 Hz)] showed a COSY connectivity to the methylene at H9 [
d
1.63a, 1.13b (dq, 
J
¼ 12.5, 7.4 Hz), m] and showed HMBC correlations to C7 and C9, thus indicating the alkyl group position on the second ring system (
Fig. 2
).
</p>
         <p>
TOCSY connectivities further supported the second ring system showing H5 to H7, and subsequently H7 to H9-H10 and H8 connectivities (SI 
Fig. S2-S
14). The relative stereo-configuration was established based on NOESY and ROESY correlations and by comparison to the structurally similar epoxyroussoeone (

). Epoxynemanione A (
1
) and epoxyroussoeone both contain pyrone and epoxide ring substructures, with comparable epoxide quaternary carbons at 
d
68.4 
vs.
61.8 and 89.8 
vs.
88.2 ppm, and two oxymethines at 64.7 
vs.
65.1 ppm and 66.4 
vs.
68.5 ppm, respectively. The structures differ in that epoxyroussoeone has a benzene ring and a methyl group at C2. NOESY and ROESY correlations for epoxynemanione A (
1
) could be observed between H5 to H6a/b, H8 to H6b, H8 to H9a, but no observable correlations between H7 and H5 or H7 to H8. Based on these findings, it is speculated that the oxymethine protons at H5 and H8 are in a “syn” orientation, similar to that of epoxyroussoeone, and that H7 to H8 are “anti” to each other.

Nemanifuranone A (
2
) was the most abundant metabolite produced by 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. serpens
</tp:taxon-name>
and was isolated as colorless crystals from the 
<tp:taxon-name>HPLC</tp:taxon-name>
fractions containing a mixture of acetonitrile and H 
2
O with 0.1% formic acid (v/v). Its HRESIMS spectra showed a protonated molecular ion at 
m/z
155.0705, affording a formula of C 
8
H 
10
O 
3
with four double bond equivalents. The 
1
H NMR spectrum indicated the presence of two olefinic protons at 
d
6.82 (dq, 
J
¼ 15.6, 6.9 Hz) and 
d
6.51 (dq, 
J
¼ 15.5, 1.7 Hz), one oxymethine at 
d
5.32 (s), and two methyl groups at 
d
1.97 (dd, 
J
¼ 6.9, 1.7 Hz) and 
d
1.67 (s) (
Table 2
, SI Fig. S15 
‾
S20). The core structure of (
2
) became evident as a 5- alkenyl-3(2H)-furanone based on the 
13
C DEPTq and HSQC assignments, with quaternary carbons at C3, C4 and C5 (201.4, 109.1 and 177.7 ppm), and a hemiacetal group at C2 (96.4 ppm). To our knowledge, the hemiacetal moiety at the C2 position is the first report from an endophytic fungi containing the 5-alkenyl-3(2H)- furanone core. A hemiketal moiety has been reported from bacterial-derived compounds, such as the actinofuranones A/B, aurafuron A/B, E-492, E837, and E-975, hyafurones and linfuranone A, with few notable exceptions such as AS-183 isolated from the fungus

SPC-15549 and polypropionates 1 
‾
3 from marine mollusks (

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

). HMBC correlations of the oxymethine proton at C2 to the carbonyl at C3 and carbon at C5 supported the presence of a hemiacetal moiety, with the methyl singlet at C9 (5.4 ppm) having correlation to C3, C4 and C5, and long-range 
4
J
coupling to C6 (SI Fig. S18). The olefinic protons at C6 (119.9 ppm) and C7 (139.7 ppm) exhibited a COSY connectivity and in a trans (
E
) configuration based on the 
3
J
vicinal 
1
H- 
1
H coupling constant of 15.5 
‾
15.6 Hz for the double bond. The methyl doublet of doublets at C8 (19.0 ppm) showed a COSY connectivity with C7 and HMBC correlations to C6 and C7, confirming the 5-alkenyl moiety (
Fig. 2
). The final structure and relative stereochemistry of nemanifuranone A (
2
) was confirmed based on single crystal X-ray data and found to be a 1:1 racemic mixture at the C2 hemiacetal (
Fig. 3
).
</p>
         <p>
Nemanifuranone B (
3
) was isolated as a beige solid and was a minor product relative to the other compounds. HRESIMS for the protonated species afforded an 
m/z
at 157.0857, providing a molecular formula of C 
8
H 
12
O 
3
, with three double bond equivalents. The 
1
H NMR spectrum revealed the absence of the olefinic protons as seen in (
2
), yet the oxymethine proton was clearly present at 
d
5.30 (s), with two methyl groups at 
d
1.55 (s) and 
d
0.93 (t, 
J
¼ 7.4 Hz). The major difference between (
2
) and (
3
) was the presence of two methylene groups at 
d
2.48 (dd, 
J
¼ 7.5, 1.8 Hz) and 
d
1.60 (h, 
J
¼ 7.4 Hz), indicating that the double bond had been reduced (
Table 2
). The 
13
C DEPTq NMR and multiplicity-edited HSQC spectra showed the presence of eight carbon atoms, with three quaternary carbons at C3, C4, and C5 (200.9, 108.2, 186.8 ppm), a hemiacetal at C2 (96.3 ppm) to complete the furanone moiety, with two methylenes at C6 and C7 (29.9, 19.0 ppm), and two methyl groups at C8 and C9 (13.4, 5.3 ppm). The alkyl chain moiety was evident from the COSY connectivities of the C8 methyl triplet to the methylene C7, and C7 to both C6 and C8, including HMBC long-range coupling of C6 to C5 and C9 (
Fig. 2
, SI Fig. S21 
‾
S27).
</p>
         <p>
Nemanifuranone C (
4
) was isolated as a golden oil and was the most polar compound of the nemanifuranone family. Its HRESIMS showed a protonated species at 
m/z
173.0812, affording a molecular formula of C 
8
H 
12
O 
4
, indicating three degrees of unsaturation. Similar to (
3
), no olefinic protons were present in the 
1
H NMR spectrum, but an additional oxymethine proton was observed at 
d
3.98 (ddd, 
J
¼ 13.5, 6.6, 3.4 Hz), with the C2 hemiacetal at 
d
5.28 (s) (
Table 2
). Additionally, one methylene group was observed at 
d
2.63 (td, 
J
¼ 13.9, 6.9 Hz) with two methyl groups at 
d
1.56 (s) and 
d
1.13 (d, 
J
¼ 6.2 Hz). Examination of the 
13
C NMR and multiplicity-edited HSQC spectra showed the presence of two sets of signals for the 8 carbon atoms, indicating the presence of an isomer or a second diastereomer (SI Fig. S27 
‾
S34). The furanone moiety was intact with quaternary carbons at C3, C4, and C5 (201.0/200.9 ppm, 109.3/ 109.2 ppm, 184.9/184.9 ppm), and the hemiacetal at C2 (96.3/ 96.3 ppm). The second oxymethine proton can be attributed to the C7 (64.2/64.1 ppm) position based on the HMBC correlations and COSY connectivities to the methylene at C6 (38.7 ppm) and the methyl doublet at C8 (23.4/23.4 ppm). The presence of a fixed chiral center at C6 and epimers at C2 results in two diasteriomers, and hence the equivalent intensity of the two sets of carbon signals. This has also been observed with several compounds containing a 5-alkenyl-3, 3(2H)-furanone moiety (

; 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Nemanifuranone D (
5
) was isolated as a beige solid with the HRESIMS spectrum giving the protonated ion at 
m/z
169.0864, and a sodium adduct ion at 
m/z
191.0681 affording a molecular formula of C 
9
H 
12
O 
3
with four degrees of unsaturation (SI Fig. 35). Its 
1
H NMR spectrum showed the presence of two olefinic protons at 
d
6.64 (dt, 
J
¼ 15.6, 6.7 Hz) and 
d
5.90 (dt, 
J
¼ 15.6, 1.7 Hz), one oxymethine proton at 
d
5.14 (s), a methylene at 
d
1.79 (pd, 
J
¼ 7.4, 1.7 Hz), and two methyl groups at 
d
1.52 (s) and 
d
0.74 (t, 
J
¼ 7.5 Hz) (
Table 3
). This indicated a butyl chain at the 5 position in (
5
) as compared to the propenyl evident in (
2
). Its 
13
C NMR spectra showed the furanone moiety at C2, C3, C4, C5 and C9 (96.2, 200.8, 108.8, 177.2, 5.w ppm). HMBC correlations between the methyl singlet at C10 to quaternary carbons at C3, C4, and C5; and the C2 hemiacetal to C5 were also evident. In the HMBC, the olefinic protons at C6 (116.9 ppm) showed a correlation with C5, while C7 (144.5 ppm) showed a correlation to C5 and olefinic C6 (SI Fig. 27). Similarly, COSY correlations were found between C7 to H6 and the methylene at C8 (
Fig. 2
, SI Fig. S36-S40). The double bond configuration was established to be trans (
E
) based on the 
3
J
vicinal 
1
H- 
1
H coupling constant of 15.5 
‾
15.6 Hz, also observed in (
2
) and (
15
). The methyl triplet at C9 (12.5 ppm) had a COSY and HMBC correlation to the methylene at C8, thus confirming the extended alkyl chain.

F (

) were minor products isolated separately as beige solids, with

elution times differing by ~ 1.2 min. Their HRESIMS spectra gave identical molecular ions at 
m/z
309.1334, and a sodiated ion adduct at 
m/z
331.1157, both affording the same molecular formula of C 
16
H 
20
O 
6
, with seven degrees of unsaturation. Given the identical formulae, but differing retention times, this indicated two diasteriomers. The 
1
H NMR spectrum of (
6
) and (
7
) showed two olefinic protons at 
d
5.61/5.62 and 
d
5.74/5.81, one oxymethine proton at 
d
5.31/5.33, one methylene at 
d
2.34, 2.27/2.85, 2.50, one methine at 
d
2.50/2.51 and three methyl groups at 
d
1.86/1.84, 
d
1.74/1.73, and 
d
1.08/0.76 ppm (
Table 4
). Analysis of the 
13
C NMR and multiplicity-edited HSQC spectra indicated 16 carbon resonances, with seven quaternary carbons (203.9/204.0, 188.3/189.1, 171.1/171.2, 139.0/138.8, 135.04/ 135.1, 111.3/111.4, and 90.1/89.9). The carbon resonances at 98.1/ 98.0 ppm were indicative of a hemiacetal at C2. Long-range HMBC correlations of C2 to C5 (188.3/189.1 ppm) and the methyl singlet at C9 (5.6/5.6 ppm) to the C3 carbonyl and C4, C5 quaternary carbons confirmed a furanone moiety, accounting for three double bond equivalents (SI Fig. S41-S53). One of the remaining double bond equivalents could be assigned to a short acyl chain based on the olefinic protons, while the three remaining degrees of unsaturation indicated the presence of a second ring system. HMBC correlations of the methyl singlet C 
90
(9.2/9.0 ppm) to the four quaternary carbons at C 
20
(171.1 ppm), C 
30
(135.0/135.1 ppm), C 
40
(139.0/ 138.8 ppm), and C 
50
(90.1/89.9 ppm) supported the presence of a lactone ring (
Fig. 2
). The coupling of the furanone and lactone ring was established based on the key HMBC correlations of the methyl doublet at C8 (15.0/13.3 ppm) to the methylene at C6, the methine proton at C7 (36.5/36.5 ppm), and the lactone quaternary at C 
50
(90.1/89.9 ppm), and was further corroborated by COSY and TOCSY connectivities. The alkyl chain was unambiguously determined to be attached to the lactone ring at C 
50
, with key HMBC and COSY/ TOCSY correlations of the olefinic C 
60
(129.6/129.8 ppm) and C 
70
(127.6/128.1 ppm) to C 
50
, and the methyl doublet of doublets at C 
80
(17.9/17.9 ppm) to C 
70
and C 
60
. The alkyl double bond was consistent with (

) having an 
E
configuration based the

d
2.85a, 2.50b and the C8 methyl doublet at 
d

0.76. Analysis of the ROESY spectrum revealed the key connectives of H 
90
to H7, H7 to H6a, H8 to H6b, and H7 to H 
60
, which are indicative of a fixed stereochemistry at C 
50
and a relative stereochemical orientation of “anti” for compound (
6
) and “syn” for compound (

. Examination of the lactone ring system shows similarity to the known compound serpenone, a 3-methoxy-4-methyl-5-(prop-1-enyl) furan-2(5H)-one isolated from the soil fungus

Nemanilactone A (

m/z
155.0703, affording a molecular formula of C 
8
H 
10
O 
3
, with four degrees of unsaturation (SI Fig. 54). Its 
1
H NMR spectrum showed olefinic resonances at 
d
5.29 (dqd, 
J
¼ 14.0, 6.6, 0.8 Hz) and 
d
4.66 (ddq, 
J
¼ 15.3, 8.5, 1.7 Hz), with an oxymethine at 
d
4.35 (dt, 
J
¼ 8.5, 1.2 Hz) and two methyl groups at 
d
1.34 (d, 
J
¼ 1.3 Hz) and 
d
1.29 (dd, 
J
¼ 6.6, 1.7 Hz). The 
13
C NMR and multiplicity-edited HSQC spectra revealed 9 carbon atoms with a carbonyl at 170.5 ppm, two additional quaternary carbons at 138.0, and 129.7 ppm, olefinic methines at 132.9 and 126.7 ppm, an oxymethine proton at 82.5 ppm, and two methyl groups at 17.5 and 9.0 ppm (
Table 3
). Examination of the multiplicity-edited HSQC- TOCSY and COSY connectivities showed the methyl doublet at C8 (17.5 ppm) connected to C7 (132.9 ppm) and subsequently to C6 (129.9 ppm) and the oxymethine proton at C5 (82.5 ppm). Based on the 
3
J
vicinal 
1
H- 
1
H coupling constant of 14.0 
‾
15.3 Hz, the alkenyl group was established to be a 
trans
configuration. Key HMBC correlations between C9 to C2, C3, C4 and the oxymethine proton at C5, supported the presence of a lactone core (
Fig. 2
, SI Fig. S54-S60). Nemanifuranones E 
‾
F (
6/7
) identified earlier are likely products of compounds (
2
) and (
8
). Nemanilactone A (
8
) is a previously undescribed structural analogue of the known compound serpenone, which possesses a hydroxyl moiety at C3 instead of a methoxy group (

).
</p>
         <p>
Nemanilactone B (
9
) was a minor product that was isolated as a beige solid. Its molecular formula of C 
16
H 
18
O 
6
was established from the sodiated adduct in the HRESIMS spectrum at 
m/z
329.0998, and indicated eight double bond equivalents. Its 
13
C NMR and multiplicity-edited HSQC revealed 16 carbon atoms, with assignments similar to the lactone core (171.4, 136.6, 138.5, 89.95 ppm) and an alkyl chain with the olefinic methines (129.2, 128.1, 18.0 ppm), as seen in (
6/7
) and in (
8
) (
Table 5
). Key HMBC correlations confirmed the lactone group with the methyl singlet at 
d
1.79/9.0 ppm correlating as expected to the carbonyl at 171.4 ppm and the two quaternary carbons at 136.8 (hydroxyl) and 138.5 ppm (
Fig. 2
, SI Fig. S61 
‾
S68). The alkenyl moiety was assigned an 
E
configuration based on the 
3
J
vicinal 
1
H- 
1
H coupling constant of 15.5 
‾
15.5 Hz, and was connected to the quaternary at C 
50
(89.9 ppm). The presence of additional quaternary carbons at 166.6, 142.4, 121.9 and 150.2 ppm, suggested the presence of a second lactone group, and accounted for the remaining four double bond equivalents. The methyl singlet at 
d
1.84/7.1 ppm showed HMBC correlations to the C2 carbonyl at 166.6 ppm and to C3, C4 and C5. The final methyl doublet at 
d
1.15/16.0 ppm had a COSY coupling to the C7 methine at 
d
3.34/36.5 ppm, and HMBC correlations to C6, C7 and C 
50
. The C6 methine at 
d
4.64/106.9 ppm correlated to C5, C7 and C8, thus connecting the two lactone systems. ROESY correlations show coupling between the methyl at H8 to the methine at H6, and H 
60
to H 
90
, indicating the orientation is similar to (
6/7
). Efforts to crystallize compound (
9
) proved unsuccessful in acetone, acetonitrile, benzene, methanol and chloroform, with gradual degradation over time.

         <p>
Nemanilactone C (
10
) was isolated as a beige solid, eluting ~1 min after (
9
). Its HRESIMS spectrum gave a protonated parent ion at 
m/z
307.1180, giving a molecular formula of C 
16
H 
18
O 
6
with eight double bond equivalents, identical to (
9
). Its 
1
H NMR spectrum showed resonances at 
d
6.23 (dq, 
J
¼ 15.6, 1.4 Hz) and 
d
6.18 (dq, 
J
¼ 15.6, 6.3 Hz) for an olefinic group, two additional methines at 
d
5.41 (d, 
J
¼ 10.0 Hz) and 
d
3.30 (m), and four methyl groups at 
d
1.95 (s), 
d
1.89 (d, 
J
¼ 6.9 Hz), 
d
1.80 (s), and 
d
0.96 (d, 
J
¼ 7.2 Hz) ppm (
Table 5
). The 
13
C NMR and multiplicity-edited HSQC spectra revealed 16 carbon atoms, with similar assignments to those displayed by (
9
). The two lactone systems are also evident in compound (
10
). Thus the structures likely differ at the coupling site between the two lactone moieties. The first lactone ring was nearly identical in assignments with the C2, C3, C4 and C5 quaternary carbons (167.1,142.1,122.51,150.8 ppm). The key differences arise in the HMBC correlation of methyl singlet at C 
90
(
d
1.80/7.2 ppm) to C 
30
(81.1 ppm), C 
40
(114.5 ppm), importantly to C 
50
(148.2 ppm) and the olefinic methine at C 
60
(117.6 ppm). Similarly, C 
60
has an HMBC correlation to C 
50
(148.2 ppm), which was part of a double bond with C 
40
(
Fig. 2
). The change in the double bond placement removes the conjugation with the carbonyl, thus shifting C 
40
from 138.5 ppm in (
9
) to 114.5 ppm, and C 
50
from 89.9 ppm to 148.2 ppm (SI Fig. S61, S69-S74). The 
E
configuration of the alkenyl moiety was based on the 
3
J
vicinal 
1
H- 
1
H coupling constant of 15.6 
‾
15.60 Hz. The two systems are similarly connected through the COSY coupling and HMBC correlations of the C6 (107.5 ppm) and C7 (37.1 ppm) methine and C8 (15.6 ppm) methyl doublet to the hydroxyl quaternary carbon at C 
30
(81.1 ppm). Crystallization efforts with compound (
10
) proved unsuccessful.

The known metabolites 
11‾13
were isolated as minor products from the filtrate extracts, with varying yields across batches grown in PDB media (SI Fig. S100). Although previously synthesized, isolation of (

herein, is the first report from a natural source. To our knowledge, (
11
) has only been reported as a synthetic intermediate for non-steroidal ligands used for inducing or suppressing gene expression in animal/plant cells (

). The metabolite was isolated as a golden-yellow solid, eluting after compounds 
5‾7
. Its HRESIMS afforded a molecular ion at 
m/z
183.0649, thus establishing the molecular formula as C 
9
H 
10
O 
4
with 5 double bond equivalents. The 
1
H NMR and multiplicity-edited HSQC spectra revealed the presence of three aromatic protons at 
d
7.57/131.0 ppm, 
d
7.41/116.5 ppm, and 
d
7.36/115.9 ppm, one oxymethylene proton at 
d
5.36/68.0 ppm, and a methoxy group at 3.91/55.8 ppm. Analysis of the 
13
C NMR spectrum revealed the expected nine carbon resonances with a carboxylic acid moiety at 170.5 ppm and the quaternary carbons at 154.0, 134.9 and 126.5 ppm. Key HMBC correlations of the methoxy group to the quaternary carbon at 154.0 ppm, and the oxymethylene to the quaternary carbons at 154.0, 126.5 and 134.9 ppm, unambiguously confirmed the known structure (SI Fig. S75

unlike (

Examination of the literature revealed that few of the reported 5-alkenyl-3(2H)-furanone compounds show significant activity against Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria; however, several are cytotoxic.

3. Conclusion
</title>
         <p>
The discovery of epoxynemanione A (
1
), nemanifuranones A-F (
2‾7
) and nemanilactones A-C (
8‾10
), including four known compounds (
11‾14
), has demonstrated the potential for fungal endophytes from fruiting plants to be an excellent source for previously undescribed specialized metabolites, that may play a role in the chemical ecology of host plant defense mechanisms. Nemanifuranones A-F (
2‾7
) are a previously undescribed series of 5- alkenyl-3(2H)-furanones possessing a rare C2 hemiacetal, with shortened alkyl chains, and furanone-lactone derivatives with few structurally similar compounds. These discoveries are of interest as nemanifuranone A (
2
) was active against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive activity, warranting further study into plantmicrobe microbiomes and agriculturally important flowering plants.

4.3. Fermentation and metabolite isolation
</title>
         <p>
Metabolites (
1‾14
) were isolated from several 2 L pooled fermentation batches of 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. serpens
</tp:taxon-name>
grown in potato dextrose media (SI Fig. 100). Each fermentation batch consisted of 10 × 1 L Roux bottles containing PDB media (200 mL, 
24 g
/L potato dextrose) and fermented in stationary culture for 40 days at 25 
ǫC
. In total, 12 L of fermentation culture was harvested, with some differences in metabolite production seen across each batch (SI Fig. 100). Culture filtrates were vacuum filtered using Whatman #4 filters to separate the broth from the mycelium. The filtrate was extracted with equal volumes of EtOAc (1:1 ratio) and dried under reduced pressure (
2.68 g
/12 L). The mycelium was extracted in two stages, first with MeOH and secondly with acetone, each at 1 L per 2 L of fermentation. The organic mycelia fractions were then pooled and dried under reduced pressure. The crude filtrate and mycelia extracts were next re-suspended in minimal amounts of MeOH. Filtrates were then centrifuged at 

13,226 
g

for 10 min and Acrodisc (
13 mm

0.45 mm
GHP) filtered prior to 
<tp:taxon-name>HPLC</tp:taxon-name>
purification. Semi-preparative 
<tp:taxon-name>HPLC</tp:taxon-name>
purification was performed on an Agilent 1100 series 
<tp:taxon-name>HPLC</tp:taxon-name>
equipped with a G1315B diode array detector and monitored at four wavelengths of 210, 254, 275 and 
350 nm
. Metabolite (
