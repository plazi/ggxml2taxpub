The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia
</tp:taxon-name>
produces a wide variety of sesquiterpenoids. The Mediterranean plant 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia laciniata
Rouy
</tp:taxon-name>
is known to have a product profile that differs from several other species in the genus. Thus, the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenoids in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia laciniata
Rouy
</tp:taxon-name>
was investigated. Here we describe three terpene synthases, 
Tl
TPS820, 
Tl
TPS509 and 
Tl
TPS18983. 
Tl
TPS18983 is a multi-product enzyme with farnesene as the major product, while 
Tl
TPS509 produces guaiol and bulnesol along with other major and several minor unknown products. 
Tl
TPS820 is orthologous to 
Tg
TPS2 from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia garganica
</tp:taxon-name>
L. and is an epikunzeaol synthase. 
Tg
CYP76AE2 from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia garganica
</tp:taxon-name>
performs a triple hydroxylation of epikunzeaol at C-12 to make dihydrocostunolide. It was therefore investigated if the cytochrome P450, 
Tl
CYP76AE4 was able to use epikunzeaol as a substrate. It was found that 
Tl
CYP76AE4 hydroxylates epikunzeaol at C-8 to yield tovarol instead of dihydrocostunolide.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
The 
<tp:taxon-name>Apiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family is known to include species of great nutritional and pharmacological value, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Daucus carota
</tp:taxon-name>
L. (carrot) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia garganica
</tp:taxon-name>
L. (deadly carrot). Species from the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia
</tp:taxon-name>
have been used in traditional medicine for millennia for a variety of ailments including rheumatism, insect bites, acne, colds and for purging (

). The presence of biologically active compounds, several of which are sesquiterpenoids, may justify the traditional use (

). While many species in 
<tp:taxon-name>Apiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
have been studied for their chemical composition, only a few genes involved in biosynthesis of sesquiterpenoids have been characterized. The initial enzymes involved in the specialized biosynthesis of sesquiterpenoids are the sesquiterpene synthases (sqTPS). 
A
few sqTPSs have been characterized in 
<tp:taxon-name>Apiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, these include a sqTPS from 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. carota
</tp:taxon-name>
producing (
E
)- 
β
-caryophyllene and 
α
-humulene (

), a δcadinene synthase (
Tg
TPS1) and an epikunzeaol synthase (
Tg
TPS2) from 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. garganica
(
Pickel et al., 2012
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and the germacrene D synthase from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia laciniata
(
Andersen et al., 2015a
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. Of these, the epikunzeaol synthase 
Tg
TPS2 from 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. garganica
</tp:taxon-name>
has been of particular interest. The structure of epikunzeaol makes this a likely precursor for thapsigargin. Thapsigargin is a potent inhibitor of the mammalian sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca 
2+
-ATPase (

) with a complex structure that requires several unknown biosynthetic steps. The recently discovered cytochrome P450, 
Tg
CYP76AE2, from 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. garganica
</tp:taxon-name>
was found to make a triple hydroxylation of epikunzeaol, thereby oxidizing C-12 to a carboxylic acid, which enabled formation of the lactone ring present in thapsigargin (

). While several species in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia
</tp:taxon-name>
genus produce sesquiterpene lactones, these specific 
type
of compounds are not found in 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
(
Drew et al., 2012
)
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
The 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia
</tp:taxon-name>
genus is still in need of revision and several species are unresolved. 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
Rouy
</tp:taxon-name>
has also been known as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia villosa
</tp:taxon-name>
type
II L. and is still listed as unresolved on http://www.theplantlist. org/. Studies of marker sequences in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia
</tp:taxon-name>
genus, however, support the assignment of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
as an independent species that is distinct from the classic 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. villosa
(
Weitzel et al., 2014
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
is commonly found in the southern parts of 
France
and in 
Catalonia
, 
Spain
. 
A
variety of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids have been reported from this species, with guaiols and germacrenols as the major sesquiterpenoids in the roots (

). In 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
the only enzyme described so far is the germacrene D synthase, 
Tl
TPS7414 (

). Here, we present the finding of an orthologue of 
Tg
TPS2 namely 
Tl
TPS820 that also produces epikunzeaol. Two additional sqTPSs, 
Tl
TPS18983 and 
Tl
TPS509 give further insight into the diverse sesquiterpenoid profile in 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
there is no equivalent sequence to 
Tg
CYP76AE2, which explains the lack of sesquiterpene lactones. The orthologue 
Tl
CYP76AE4 instead catalyzes the hydroxylation of epikunzeaol at C-8 to yield tovarol.

2.1. Identification of genes
</title>
         <p>
A
homology-based search using BLAST was initiated to investigate if 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. garganica
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
harbored orthologue genes for sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis. 
Tg
TPS1 and 
Tg
TPS2 from 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. garganica
</tp:taxon-name>
were used as baits in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
Illumina
</tp:taxon-name>
transcriptome dataset (

). For 
Tg
TPS2, a gene with 97.2% nucleotide identity was discovered. The homology search for 
Tg
TPS1 did not yield any hits over 90% in sequence identity. Three additional sqTPSs were found; the germacrene D synthase, 
Tl
TPS7414 (

) and the unknown 
Tl
TPS509 and 
Tl
TPS18983 (

). The data set was also mined for cytochrome P450s with high sequence similarity to 
Tg
CYP76AE2, which is the gene responsible for sesquiterpene lactone formation in 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. garganica
</tp:taxon-name>
. One gene was found with 92% amino acid sequence identity and 96% nucleotide sequence identity to 
Tg
CYP76AE2. The gene was named 
Tl
CYP76AE4 (

). All genes were cloned into the pEAQ vector system for transformation into 

A
. tumefaciens

(

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Nicotiana benthamiana
</tp:taxon-name>
was used as an expression host to examine 
Tl
TPS820, 
Tl
TPS18983, 
Tl
TPS509 and 
Tl
CYP76AE4. Samples were extracted with either hexane or by HS-SPME depending of the volatility of the enzymatic products.

Leaves from

Tl
TPS820 were extracted with hexane and analyzed by GC-MS. The analysis yielded a sesquiterpenoid profile identical to 
Tg
TPS2 (

). The main product of 
Tg
TPS2 is epikunzeaol (
1
) (

), thus 
Tl
TPS820 is also an epikunzeaol synthase and an orthologue of 
Tg
TPS2. As described previously, the high injection port temperature at 250 ̊C lead to cope-rearrangement of 
1
(
Andersen et al., 2017
). Thus, 
1
was partly degraded to two unknown alcohols

TPS509 resulted in the detection of two major sesquiterpene alcohols, guaiol (

4

3
and 
4
exhibited similar EI MS spectrum to those of bulnesol and guaiol in NIST and Wiley GC-MS spectrum libraries. The product profile showed several additional compounds, and we could identify two minor products; guaiene (RI 1418, Rt: 8.6)) and bulnesene (RI 1487, Rt: 9.18) (

). Several peaks with a 
m/z
of 220 were also observed but not identified. A hexane extract of 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. benthamiana
</tp:taxon-name>
leaves, expressing 
Tl
TPS509 was analyzed by GC-MS using a Programmed Temperature Vaporising injector (PTV) port. By using a low initial temperature of 60 ̊C followed by a gradual increase to 250 ̊C it was expected that thermal rearrangements were avoided. Again, 
3
and 
4
were detected as major compounds, but not guaiene and bulnesene, which were probably below the detection limit. Furthermore, neither of the unknown compounds with 
m/z
220 were detected in the PTV analysis.

). It was not possible to identify the remaining products. Using an injection port temperature of 160 ̊C instead of 250 ̊C did not alter the composition of the chromatogram, which supports that these compounds are not a result of the GC-MS analysis method. Extraction of the products was also attempted using organic solvents such as hexane and pentane mimicking procedures that were successful for other sqTPS products. However, for 
Tl
TPS18983 we did not detect any compounds by GC-MS using organic solvent extraction.

2.5. Characterization of TlCYP76AE4 using epikunzeaol from TlTPS820 as

To investigate if

Tl
TPS820 and

CYP76AE4 were co-expressed in 
<tp:taxon-name>

1
as seen in 
Fig. 1
. One new product was detected in the GC-MS chromatogram with an injection port temperature of 250 ̊ 
C
. However, the peak appeared to consist of two compounds that were co-eluting on the GC-MS. It was not possible to separate these products further. The GC-MS analysis indicated that the parent ions had a 
m/z
of 238. To further support that 
Tl
TPS820 yields 
1
, 
Tl
CYP76AE4 was also expressed with 
Tg
TPS2 and was shown to yield the same new product(s) (supplementary data 
Fig. 1
). From the chromatograms and spectrums, it was clear that 
Tl
CYP76AE4 yielded a new product. Co-expression of 
Tg
TPS2, 
Tg
CYP76AE2 and

were in agreement with the germacradiendiol tovarol (

<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia

</tp:taxon-name>
(

). Due to the low quality of the published spectra and the absence of 
13
C
NMR data a full structure elucidation was performed. The DEPT spectrum of the metabolite revealed that 
2
contained two quaternary carbon atoms, six methine carbon atoms, three methylene groups and four methyl groups. Even though most of the peaks in the recorded spectrum were broad, presumably because of a conformational equilibrium (

; 

), an in-depth investigation was possible (
Table 1
). The use of 2D spectra also enabled an assignment of the signals in the 
13
C
NMR spectrum. The 
E,E
-configuration was established through a ROESY correlation between H-1 and H-5. Model building reveals that only the 
E,E
-configuration allows H-1 and H-5 to be near in space. ROESY correlation between H-6, H-15 and H-7 revealed that H-6 and H-7 were cis-disposed. Comparison with a reference spectrum of tovarol (Prof. G. Appendino personal communication) revealed that previous isolated tovarol possessed the same stereochemistry at C-8 as 
2
, and revealed that the hydroxyl group at C-8 is α- disposed. 
A
ROEYS correlation between H-7 (1.05 ppm) and H-9 resonating at 1.78 ppm revealed that this H-9 must be α- disposed and consequently the signal at 2.49 ppm was H-9β. The absolute configuration was assumed based on the observation that sesquiterpenes from 
<tp:taxon-name>Apiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
plants have H-7 α- disposed (

). 
2
is therefore concluded to be tovarol (

         <p>
A
variety of sesquiterpenoids are produced in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia
</tp:taxon-name>
and the sesquiterpenoid profile often differs between species (

). Previous analysis of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. garganica
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
have shown that these species produce sesquiterpenoids with different backbones and side-group modifications (

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
has at least four functional sesquiterpene synthases and two of them, 
Tl
TPS18983 and 
Tl
TPS509, are multi-product synthases. Compared to the two sqTPS found in 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. garganica
</tp:taxon-name>
this correlates well with the higher number of metabolites described in 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
(

; 

, 

). In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Daucus carota
</tp:taxon-name>
20 sqTPS (TPS-a family) are predicted, which show that even between closely related species the number of sqTPS's can vary tremendously (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Several farnesene synthases have been described in literature. 
Tl
18983 is however the first farnesene synthase from 
<tp:taxon-name>Apiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
. The finding of a farnesene synthase is supported by the previous detection of β- farnesene in 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
(
Drew et al., 2012
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. It is interesting that 
Tl
18983 is able to produce a large number of products, which cannot merely be characterized as minor side products, at least judging by expression in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. benthamiana
</tp:taxon-name>
. Analyzing a multiproduct sqTPS is complex due to the difficulty of separating the products by GC-MS, and due to very volatile nature of these compounds. Sesquiterpenoids in many species are a part of the volatile mixture of compounds that is emitted by the plants. It can be hypothesized that the products produced by 
Tl
TPS18983 are a part of the volatile signaling compounds of 

<tp:taxon-name>T. laciniata</tp:taxon-name>
,

as also seen in other plants (

; 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Two major products of 
Tl
TPS509 were identified as guaiol (
3
) and bulnesol (
4
). Previous investigation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
sesquiterpenoids (

; 

) also showed that 
3
is produced by this species. Three guaiane esters, (4 
S
, 5 
S
, 7 
S
, 8 
S
)-8-p-coumaroyloxy-1(10)-guaiene-11-ol, (4 
S
, 5 
S
, 7 
S
, 8 
S
)-8-feruloyloxy-1(10)- guaiene-11-ol, and (4 
S
, 5 
S
, 7 
S
, 8 
S
)-8-senecioyloxy-1(10)-guaien-11-ol have also been found in 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
(
Lemmich et al., 1991
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. All of these are derived from the structure of 
4
and have different side chain modifications at C-8. This indicates that bulnesol is a possible precursor of these three structures. The described modifications at C-8 are expected to involve a hydroxylation at C-8 followed by the addition of side chains by acyl transferases. Currently, 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
is the only species in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia
</tp:taxon-name>
that has been found to produce guaiols (

). Furthermore, α- guaiene was previously found in 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
(
Drew et al., 2012
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. This is a minor product of 
Tl
TPS509 and is the non-hydroxylated compound with the same 
type
of 5- and 7-ring structure as guaiols. The same is also observed for bulnesene and bulnesol. Co-expression of CYP76AE4 and 
Tl
TPS509 did not provide any new products. Thus, an orthologue of CYP76AE4 might be responsible for the hydroxylation at C-8, though this remains to be examined.
</p>
         <p>
Tl
TPS820 produces epikunzeaol (
1
) as a main product. The discovery of the two orthologues sqTPS genes (
Tg
TPS2 and 
Tl
TPS820) in 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. garganica
</tp:taxon-name>
shows that the epikunzeaol synthase can serve as a marker for the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia
</tp:taxon-name>
genus. It also shows that the species within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia
</tp:taxon-name>
have evolved different downstream products by using 
1
as a substrate. While 
Tg
CYP76AE2 and 
Tl
CYP76AE4 are both able to use 
1
as a substrate, they perform hydroxylation on different carbon positions. This difference is also reflected in the metabolite profiles of the two species. In contrast to most 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
does not contain guaianolides, for which epidihydrocostunolide (the product of 
Tg
CYP76AE 
2 in
<tp:taxon-name>
T. garganica
</tp:taxon-name>
) appears to be a precursor (

). Tovarol has currently not been detected from 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
and could be involved in the biosynthesis of a downstream product yet to be discovered. However, tovarol and several derivatives was isolated from the closely related 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia minor
Hoffmanns. &amp; Link
</tp:taxon-name>
(

). It is likely that similar biosynthetic routes are present in 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. minor
</tp:taxon-name>
since these two species are very closely related (

; 

). It remains to be investigated if 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. minor
</tp:taxon-name>
harbors orthologue genes to those described here and in 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. garganica
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
The products detected by GC-MS from 
Tg
CYP76AE2 were shown to be Cope re-arrangements of dihydrocostunolide (

). It is highly probable that 
2
from 
Tl
CYP76AE4 has also undergone Cope re-arrangement during exposure to the high injection port temperature in the GC-MS (
Fig. 1
). Through the isolation of 
2
it was clear from our LC data that 
Tl
CYP76AE4 only produces 
2
as the product.
</p>
         <p>
The expression of genes, involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. benthamiana
</tp:taxon-name>
has previously been reported to result in the conjugation of produced sesquiterpenoids. This was shown for artemisinic acid in the artemisinin pathway, which was conjugated to a diglucoside (

). In costunolide biosynthesis, the analysis was affected by the conjugation of costunolide to glutathione or cysteine (

). LC-MS analysis of 
2
from 
Tl
CYP76AE4 did not reveal any conjugation to the two alcohol groups, which therefore allowed for detection by GC-MS as well. 
1
on the other hand from 
Tl
TPS820 and 
Tg
TPS2 was found both in its free form in GC-MS analysis and as a disaccharide in LC-MS analysis.

4. Conclusion
</title>
         <p>
We have described the activity of three sesquiterpene synthases from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia laciniata
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Tl
TPS820 was found to be an epikunzeaol synthase whereas 
Tl
TPS18983 and 
Tl
TPS509 are multi-product sesquiterpene synthases, with farnesene as the major product of 
Tl
TPS18983 and guaiol and bulnesol as the major products of 
Tl
TPS509. 
Tl
TPS820 is an orthologue to 
Tg
TPS2 from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thapsia garganica
</tp:taxon-name>
and co-expression with the cytochrome P450 
Tl
CYP76AE4 led to the biosynthesis of tovarol. Thus, we have shown that 
Tl
CYP76AE4 hydroxylate epikunzeaol at C-8 to yield tovarol.

The crude hexane extract was subjected to an initial preparative separation on a silica column and eluted stepwise in hexane-ethyl acetate, from hexane to hexane:ethyl acetate (80:20) with 2% increments. The final purification of products from 
Tl
TPS509 were performed on a preparative GC-MS using an Agilent 7890B GC installed with an Agilent 5977 
A
inert MSD, GERSTEL Preparative Fraction Collector (PFC) AT 6890/7890 and a GERSTEL CIS 4 
C
Bundle injection port. For separation by GC, a RESTEK Rtx-5 column (
30m
× 
0.53 mm
ID x 1 μm df) with H 
2
as the carrier gas was used. 
A
split piece with a split of 1:100 (
MS
:PFC) was placed at the end of this column. Sufficient amounts of sesquiterpene product for NMR analysis (
0.5–1 mg
) were obtained with 5 μL injections of extract repeated 100 times. The injection port was put in solvent vent mode with a carrier gas flow of 100 mL/min until minute 0.17, combined with an injection speed of 1.5 mL/min. The purge flow was set to 3 mL/min from minute 0.17 to 2.17. The injection temperature was held at 40 ̊ 
C
for 0.1 min followed by ramping at 12 ̊ 
C
/sec until 320 ̊ 
C
, which was then held for 2 min. The column flow was set to 7.5 mL, which was held constant throughout the GC program. The GC program was set to hold at 60 ̊ 
C
for 1 min, ramp 20 ̊ 
C
/min to 320 ̊ 
C
and 320 ̊ 
C
held for 3 min. The temperature of the transfer line from GC to PFC and the PFC itself was set to 250 ̊ 
C
. The PFC was set to collect the selected peaks based on the 
MS
spectrum. The 
MS
was set in scan mode from 
m/z
35 to 
m/z
500, with a threshold of 150. Solvent cut-off was set to 4 min, and the temperature of the 
MS
source and the 
MS
quadrupole was set to 300 ̊ 
C
and 150 ̊ 
C
, respectively. Traps were kept at − 
20̊C
, in case products were prone to rearrangement, and rinsed with chloroform-d (Eurisotop, 99.8 atom % D).

5.8. Isolation of tovarol from TlCYP76AE4 by HPLC
</title>
         <p>
For isolation of tovarol, a large-scale hexane extraction was made from 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. benthamiana
</tp:taxon-name>
leaves expressing truncated 
At
HMGR, 
Tl
TPS820 and 
Tl
CYP76AE4. The leaves from approximately 100 five-week-old plants were extracted with hexane. The crude hexane extract was subjected to an initial preparative separation on an Isolera autoflasher using a 
10 g
diol functionalized silica column (Biotage, 
Uppsala
, 
Sweden
) eluted stepwise in hexane-ethyl acetate, from hexane to hexane:ethyl acetate (80:20) with 2% increments. Final isolation of tovarol was achieved by semi-preparative HPLC utilizing a 250 × 
10 mm
, 7 μm Nucleosil PEI column (Macherey-Nagel) eluted in a linear hexane-isopropanol gradient from 0 to 5% isopropanol in 20 min, on a Waters 600 HPLC equipped with a Waters 996 PDA detector. The purity was confirmed by LC-MS as described in 5.6.

NMR-spectra were acquired using a 600 MHz Bruker Avance III HD NMR spectrometer (
1
H operating frequency 600.13 MHz) equipped with a Bruker SampleJet sample changer and a cryogenically cooled gradient inverse triple-resonance 1.7-mm 
TCI
probe-head (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, 
Germany
) optimized for 
13
C
and 
1
H. Samples were analyzed at 300 K. Proton spectra, at 600.03 MHz, were obtained using 30̊-pulses, a spectral width of 12 kHz, collecting 16 scans with a length of 65536 data points with a relaxation delay of 
1.0 s
. Carbon spectra were acquired at 150.88 MHz with 30̊-pulses, a spectral width of 36 kHz, collecting 256 scans with a length of 65536 data points and with a relaxation delay of 
2.0 s
. The 
13
C
nuclei were 
1
H-decoupled using the Waltz-16 composite pulse-decoupling scheme. FID's were exponentially multiplied with a line-broadening factor of 1.0 Hz before Fourier transformation. The 2D experiments were recorded using Bruker standard parameter settings. The isolated tovarol was dissolved in MeCN-d 
3
(99.8 atom % D) prior to NMR analysis.
