Red algae (Rhodophyta) are primarily found in marine habitats around the world and they have been a prolific source of structurally diverse natural products. Among them the genus

(
<tp:taxon-name>Ceramiales</tp:taxon-name>

, include cryptic species. DNA sequence data show three genetic lineages within 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bostrychia calliptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, another polyphyletic species requiring further taxonomic investigation. In an attempt to examine whether there are differences in the metabolite pattern that support the re-circumscription of the species and to uncover biogeographic patterns, phytochemical profiling of those samples used for DNA sequencing was conducted. This investigation revealed clearly three different chemotypes, corresponding to the lineages of the published molecular analysis results. The first lineage had a distinct and recognizably different phytochemical profile in contrast to the second and the third lineage which shared some similarities. Still, variations in the pattern of their phenolic compounds allowed a clear discrimination between the second and third lineage, too. The most important marker substances were isolated and their structures elucidated resulting in the characterization of four undescribed phenols. The isolated substances from 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
</tp:taxon-name>
are considered as suitable chemotaxonomic markers within this polyphyletic group.

; (

). Another polyphyletic species of this genus is 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bostrychia calliptera
(Montagne, J.F.C 1842)
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Rhodomelaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Ceramiales</tp:taxon-name>
) (

). Most 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bostrychia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
exhibit a rather unique ecology due to their preferential occurrence in the upper littoral zone where they grow as epiphytes on mangrove trees or salt marsh vegetation, or on rocks. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bostrychia calliptera
</tp:taxon-name>
is a typical mangrove species distributed in Africa, 
Japan
and Southeast Asia, South and Central America, South of 
Australia
and 
New Zealand
(

). It occurs mainly in estuarine systems, often associated with other species, including 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. radicans
(
de Oliveira et al., 2009
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. moritziana
(
Zuccarello et al., 1999
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, but not in great abundance (

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
</tp:taxon-name>
can be distinguished from other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bostrychia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
through various unique features such as being corticated, its attachment to the substratum by peripherohaptera, unbranched determinate laterals that are borne alternately from every axial cell of the indeterminate axes and usually arise in a distichous manner, and well-developed cortication on the main axis (

).

         <p>
A
biogeographic study of corticate 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
</tp:taxon-name>
and ecorticate 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. pinnata
</tp:taxon-name>
by 

based on nuclear, mitochondrial and plastid DNA markers demonstrated that three lineages occur within the species complex, but they could not be separated on the basis of any consistent presence or absence of cortication. Thus, the authors concluded that ecorticate 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. pinnata
</tp:taxon-name>
should be considered as a synonym of corticated 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
</tp:taxon-name>
. In a broader sampling of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bostrychia
</tp:taxon-name>
based on partial 26 
S
rRNA data, 

concluded that it could be polyphyletic. Samples from lineage 1 did not group with the other 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
samples
</tp:taxon-name>
from lineage 2 and 3, which were resolved as sister taxa. These analyses have shown that lineage 1 included both corticated and uncorticated isolates collected from 
Australia
and both North and South America; lineage 2 included only uncorticated isolates from the Indo-Pacific region (
Australia
, 
Malaysia
and 
Singapore
), and lineage 3 included corticated isolates from Middle and South America (
Colombia
, 
Panama
, 
Mexico
, 
Brazil
) plus uncorticated isolates from 
Florida
, 
USA
, and 
Brazil
(Zucarrello and West, 2002, 2006). Although the presence or absence of cortication is generally considered as useful morphological trait for macroalgal species identification (

; 

), it does not work for 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
</tp:taxon-name>
because of its irregular distribution among the lineages. 
A
similar problem occurs in the lineage grouping of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. arbuscula
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. intricata
(
Zuccarello and West, 2006
)
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
Regarding their chemical composition, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bostrychia
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
are reported to produce fatty acids, amino acids, carbohydrates, polysaccharides, betaines, phenolics, and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) (

, 2012; 

; 

, 

; 

). For 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, there are only a few studies on its specialised metabolites, including volatile constituents (

) and the occurrence of three MAAs, namely porphyra-334, palythine and palythinol (

). As with most 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bostrychia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, the low molecular weight carbohydrates sorbitol, dulcitol and, less commonly, digeneaside can be found in 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
(
Zuccarello and West, 2011
)
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
MAAs are water-soluble ampholytes of low molecular weight, which are composed of a cyclohexenone or cyclohexenimine chromophore substituted by amino acids or other moieties (

). They have been isolated from marine bacteria, fungi, several animals and plants (

) and they possess photoprotective and antioxidant properties (

).
</p>
         <p>
Brominated and sulphated phenols, are phenols substituted with one or more bromine and sulfate residues, respectively (

). They are widely distributed among red (

), brown (

), and green macroalgae (

; 

), but occur also in ascidians, sponges and other animals (

). Their ecological role is not yet clear but brominated and sulphated phenols may contribute in chemical defense and deterrence and play a role as a storage 
<tp:taxon-name>form for</tp:taxon-name>
more active metabolites (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
The focus of the present study was to investigate the phytochemical profile of different isolates of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, to find possible chemotaxonomic markers that can be used for the identification of the species, to examine whether differences in the metabolite pattern support the re-circumscription of this taxon and uncover biogeographic patterns.

2.1. Isolation of the marker compounds
</title>
         <p>
Two mycosporine-like amino acids with absorption maxima at 
332 nm
and 
308 nm
were present in the chromatograms of samples belonging to lineage 1, eluting at 2.9 and 3.3 min, respectively. However, because of their small amount in the algal material it was not possible to isolate them.

         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
samples

from lineage 2 and 3 were combined and used for the isolation of specialised metabolites. Their 
H

O
/MeOH extracts were fractionated on flash chromatography, Sephadex LH-20 and/or semi-preparative 
HPLC
resulting in the isolation of six compounds.

         <p>
Characteristic NMR shifts and 
MS
spectra of compounds 
1
and 
2
(
Fig. 1
) indicated the structure of two known MAAs, porphyra-334 and palythine-threonine. Porphyra-334 has been reported in the past as a constituent of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
(
Karsten et al., 2006
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, but palythine-threonine was only found in corals and cyanobacteria (

); therefore this is the first report in algae.

δH
7.58) to the carbon of the methylene C-7 (

δH

reported the shift value of the carbon of the phenol bearing the hydroxy group to be 
δC
153.7, whereas the carbon of the phenol bearing the sulfate group was 
δC

the same solvent. The latter agrees with our determined value (
δC
150.5). Collectively, compound 
3
was finally identified as the undescribed natural product sodium 2-bromo-4-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl sulfate.

+
). Characteristic NMR shifts and 2D-NMR data of compound 
5
indicated the substructure of compound 
3.
However, the 
13
C-NMR spectrum showed 6 extra signals, corresponding to two oxygenated tertiary carbons (
δC
135.5 and 177.3), a carbonyl group (
δC
203.0), two methylenes (
δC
23.5 and 31.9) and a methoxy group (
δC
58.8). The protons of the methylene at C-10 (
δH
2.61) showed a correlation in the COSY spectrum with the protons of the methylene at position 11 (
δH
2.35). Furthermore, the HMBC correlations of H-10 (
δH
2.61) to C-8, C-9 and C-12 (
δC
135.5, 203.0 and 177.3, respectively), of H-11 (
δH
2.34) to C-9 and C-12 (
δC
203.0 and 177.3, respectively), as well as the HMBC correlation of the methoxy groups at 
δH
3.99 (H-13) to C-12 (
δC
177.3) confirmed the presence of a 3-methoxycyclopent-2-en-1-one moiety. Its presence was confirmed by a comparison with literature values (

). The two substructures were connected through an etheric bond, indicated by specific chemical shifts of position 7 and 8, as well as key HMBC correlations of H-7 to C-8 (
δC
135.5). The structure of compound 
5
was also established from the results of a single crystal X-ray determination. The asymmetric unit of the monclinic crystal structure consists of two formula units (
Fig. 1
). Each of the two crystallographically independent Na ions adopts a typical five-fold coordination which involves five oxygen atoms belonging to four different anions. The corresponding bond distances, Na1– 
O
= 2.30–2.66 
Å
and Na2– 
O
= 2.28–2.64 
Å
, are in the expected range. The interactions between Na and anion moieties result in a 2D coordination polymer, which lies parallel to the crystallographic (102) plane (
Fig. 2
) (see 
Fig. 3
).
</p>
         <p>
Collectively, compound 
5
was identified as sodium 2-bromo-4-(((2- methoxy-5-oxocyclopent-1-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)phenyl sulfate, again an undescribed natural product. Compound 
4
was assigned to the molecular formula

2
] 
+
). Characteristic NMR shifts and 2D-NMR data of compound 
4
indicated that this compound was highly similar to compound 
5.
The only difference was observed in the aromatic region where the absence of the bromine was obvious, and two signals, each corresponding to two protons (H-2 and H-6, H-3 and H-5), showed HMBC correlations to the remaining carbons of the aromatic ring. This confirmed that the aromatic ring of compound 
4
was para-substituted. Collectively, compound 
4
was finally identified as sodium 4-(((2-methoxy-5-oxocyclopent-1-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)phenyl hydrogen sulfate, an undescribed natural product.

However, the

H-NMR spectrum showed an extra ABX system (
δH
7.65 (d, 
J
= 8.8 Hz, H-18), 
δH
7.64 (d, 
J
= 2.2 Hz, H-15), 
δH
7.33 (dd, 
J
= 2.2, 8.4 Hz, H-19)), which proved to be an extra 2-bromo-4-(hydroxymethyl)phenolic ring after evaluating the HMBC correlations (
Fig. 4
). The two substructures were connected through an etheric bond, as indicated by specific chemical shifts of position 12 and 13 and key HMBC correlations of H-13 (
δH
5.28) to C-12 (
δC
175.5). Collectively, compound 
6
was finally identified as sodium 2-bromo-4-(((2-((3-bromo-4- hydroxybenzyl)oxy)-5-oxocyclopent-1-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)phenyl sulfate, an undescribed natural product.

2.2. Analysis of the marker substances in 
<tp:taxon-name>B. calliptera samples</tp:taxon-name>
         </p>
         <p>
All of the samples were extracted thrice using H 
2
O/MeOH, and after filtration they were analysed by LC-MS. 
Table 1
lists the respective results and 
Figs. 5
and 
6
, S34 and S35 show the corresponding chromatograms. Some compounds could be assigned by UV/Vis (indicated in the table as UV) others only by MS (indicated as T, trace).
</p>
         <p>
All of the samples of lineage 1 seemed to produce only two MAAs (
Fig. 5
), which could be detected at 
310 nm
with retention times of 2.9 min (
λ
max
= 
332 nm
) and 3.3 min (
λ
max
= 
308 nm
). Unfortunately, because of their low concentration in the red algal material, their isolation was not possible. Additionally, due to their high hydrophilicity they co-eluted with non UV-absorbing betaines so that their molecular mass also could not be determined. No brominated or sulphated metabolites were observed in the chromatograms of samples belonging to lineage 1.
</p>
         <p>
Contrarily, samples belonging to lineage 2 and 3 did not produce any of the MAAs present in lineage 1, instead palythine-threonine could be assigned in all of their chromatograms recorded at 310 and 
330 nm
. In addition, samples of lineage 3 contained porphyra-334, which, however, was only detected by LC-MS in Extracted Ion Chromatogram (EIC) mode. This indicates that this compound was present in minute concentrations only. Porphyra-334 was not detected in the samples belonging to lineage 2, with the exception of one (sample 4097, see 
Table 1
)Accordingly, this specimen contained a much higher concentration compared to the extracted samples of lineage 3.
</p>
         <p>
Brominated and sulphated metabolites were present in all of the extracts belonging to lineages 2 and 3 (
Fig. 6
), with compound 
5
always being the major metabolite. Compound 
3
was also present in all samples, but in almost all cases it was only detectable by MS, indicating smaller concentrations than compound 
5
. On the other hand, compound 
4
was directly assignable in the UV chromatograms of lineage 3, as well as the 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
</tp:taxon-name>
sample 2817 belonging to lineage 2. The other samples from lineage 2 contained this compound in lower amounts, detectable by mass only.
</p>
         <p>
Furthermore, compound 
6
was only detected in the UV chromatograms of lineage 3.
</p>
         <p>
Finally, one more brominated compound (
λ
max = 
228 nm
) was present in all of the samples belonging to lineages 2 and 3. Its mass spectrum can be found in the supplementary information.

3. Discussion
</title>
         <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bostrychia
</tp:taxon-name>
includes various cryptic species, whose classification has often been re-examined and revised (e.g. 

; 

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
</tp:taxon-name>
was selected for the present study to determine if differences in specimens detected by DNA analyses are also reflected in their respective chemical profiles, and to identify possible biogeographic patterns. Accordingly, 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
samples
</tp:taxon-name>
that were separated into three distinct lineages by analyses of nuclear, mitochondrial and plastid DNA markers (

, 

) were re-examined regarding their phytochemical profile.
</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>
Initially, a part of the available samples was merged and used for the extraction and isolation of specialised metabolites. This approach resulted in the isolation of six biomarkers, four of them could be identified as novel natural products. The purification protocol included flash chromatography, Sephadex LH-20 and semi-preparative 
HPLC
. Additionally, three further compounds were detected in the extracts of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
</tp:taxon-name>
, but because of either low concentration or poor stability, their structures could not be elucidated.
</p>
         <p>
Subsequently, all the available samples were analysed by LC-MS in order to determine differences in their metabolite pattern. Samples of the genetic lineage 1 seemed to be completely different from the rest of the samples since they did not share any metabolites with samples from lineage 2 and 3. They produced only two MAAs, the first eluting at 2.9 min with an absorption maximum at 
332 nm
, and the second one eluting at 3.3 min with an absorption maximum at 
308 nm
. In addition, samples of lineage 1 were lacking brominated and sulphated compounds. This observation could be related to the absence of haloperoxidases and sulphotransferases in lineage 1, enzymes mediating halogenation and catalysis of the sulfonation reaction, respectively.
</p>
         <p>
On the other hand, samples belonging to lineages 2 and 3 produced palythine-threonine and compound 
5
as their major metabolites. Compound 
3
was also present in all these samples, yet only in smaller concentrations. Nevertheless, some differences could be observed. Porphyra-334, compounds 
4
and 
6
could be found in all samples of lineage 3, in contrast to extracts from lineage 2, which in most cases did not produce any porphyra-334 or compound 
6
at all. They only contained minor concentrations of compound 
4.
</p>
         <p>
In conclusion, Lineage 1 has a completely different phytochemical profile compared to lineages 2 and 3, whereas lineages 2 and 3 share some common specialised metabolites. However, lineage 3 synthesizes a greater variety of brominated compounds and MAAs in comparison to lineage 2 and their metabolite pattern varies because of different biogeographical origin or environmental settings. Therefore, we hypothesize that members of lineage 1 could be considered as a separate species, which is different from lineage 2 and 3, while the latter might be considered as varieties or subspecies of the same species. This assumption, however, has to be verified by a comprehensive taxonomic treatment, that requires further DNA and chemical analysis, for example, on 
type
material, but this approach is far beyond the present study.
</p>
         <p>
Regarding the phylogeography of the isolates, the three lineages have a different biogeographic distribution since lineage 2 is found in 
Australia
and Southeast Asia, lineage 3 is encountered in Central and South America and lineage 1 is found in North and South America and 
Australia
. Therefore, taking into consideration that the differences in the phytochemical profile and the molecular data of the latter two are quite distinct, their discrimination would be quite easy in combination with the biogeographical origin of the sample.
</p>
         <p>
Molecules from the same classes of specialised metabolites have been used to support the identification of algal species, for example, MAAs for the chemotaxonomy within the green algal 
<tp:taxon-name>
Prasiola
</tp:taxon-name>
clade (

), bromophenols for the identification of the red alga 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhodomela
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
(W. 

), and sulphated phenolic compounds for the classification of various seagrass species (

). Additionally, 

reported that Dsorbitol was present in 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. tenuissima
</tp:taxon-name>
(
H
1 haplotype) of colder areas in contrast to the other two haplotypes, 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. kingii
</tp:taxon-name>
sp nov (

). and 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. simpliciuscula
</tp:taxon-name>
(
H
2 and 
H
3 haplotypes) from warmer areas which produced both D-dulcitol and D-sorbitol. Furthermore, 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. scorpioides
</tp:taxon-name>
which is the only 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bostrychia
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
growing in Europe, showed a completely different MAA pattern compared to other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bostrychia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
(

). Hence, the here reported substances from 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
</tp:taxon-name>
may be considered as suitable biomarkers for chemotaxonomic studies within this polyphyletic group.

), whereas low-resolution mass spectra were measured on an Agilent InfinityLab LC/MSD System comprising of an Agilent 1260 
HPLC
(Santa Clara, 
CA
, 
USA
), equipped with binary pump, autosampler, column oven and photodiode array detector). IR spectra were measured on an Alpha FTIR Spectrometer (Bruker,

X2 iES flash chromatography system (Büchi, Flawil, 
Switzerland
) or a semi-preparative 
HPLC
UltiMate 3000 (Thermo, Waltham, MA, 
USA
), comprising a

4.4. Extraction and isolation
</title>
         <p>The available samples partially had to be combined to allow the isolation of marker substances.</p>
         <p>
Accordingly, 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera
samples
</tp:taxon-name>
3016, 3216, 3054 and 3065 were merged and used for the isolation of the specialised metabolites of lineage 1 (BCAL_ 
A
). Extract BCAL_ 
A
(
1.7 g
) was crushed to powder in a grinding mill and extracted thrice in an ultrasonic bath (Bandelin Sonorex 35 KHz, 
Berlin
, 
Germany
) for 15 min using methanol/ water = 1/1 (v/v). Subsequently, it was fractionated using reversed-phase flash chromatography, Sephadex LH-20 and semi-preparative 
HPLC
. However, due to the small amount of the extract and the minor concentration of the MAAs, their isolation and structural elucidation were not possible.

         <p>
On the other hand, 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. calliptera

</tp:taxon-name>
, 2962, 3066, 2817, 3090, 3191, 3194, 3400, 3041 and 3042 were used for the isolation of the specialised metabolites of lineage 2 and 3 (BCAL _ 
B
). The plant material was extracted as described above.
</p>
         <p>
Subsequently, BCAL_ 
B
(
2.6 g
) was fractionated with reversed-phase flash chromatography using gradient elution (water to methanol), resulting in 6 fractions. Fractions 4 and 5 were individually fractionated on Sephadex LH-20 material, using methanol/water = 1/1 (v/v) as eluent for fraction 4 and MeOH for fraction 5.
</p>
         <p>
Column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 of fraction 5 (
158 mg
) resulted in the isolation of compounds 
3
(3.0 mg), 
5
(
31.7 mg
) and 
6
(
8.6 mg
).
</p>
         <p>
Using the same approach for fraction 4 (
39 mg
) resulted in 2 subfractions, with the second fraction being a pure compound (compound 
4
, 
6.5 mg
). Sub-fraction 4a (
19.4 mg
) was subjected to semi-preparative 
HPLC
using a Synergi 4 u Polar-RP column (250 × 
10 mm
, 4 μm; Phenomenex, Torrance, 
CA
, 
USA
). The mobile phase comprised of 0.25% (v/v) formic acid in water (
A
) and methanol (
B
) and the following gradient was used: 0 min: 2% 
B
, 5 min: 10% 
B
, 25 min: 20% 
B
, 30 min: 20% 
B

B
, 40 min: 98% 
B
, 40.1 min: 2% 
B
, 55 min: 2%

. This resulted in the isolation of compounds 
1
(

2
(

4.5. Analytical method for the chemical profiling of 
<tp:taxon-name>B. calliptera samples</tp:taxon-name>
         </p>
         <p>
All samples (
5–80 mg
) were extracted thrice with 1.5 mL of H 
2
O/ MeOH = 1/1 (v/v) and after filtration and evaporation they were redissolved in H 
2
O and analysed by LC-MS in concentrations of 
1 mg
/mL. The separation of the metabolites was performed on a YMC-Pack Pro C18 RS column 
8 nm
, S-3μm, (150 × 4, 
6 mm
) from YMC (
Kyoto
, 
Japan
), using a mobile phase comprising 20 mM ammonium formate and 0.6% (v/v) formic acid in water (A) and methanol (B). Liquid chromatography - diode array detector - electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI-MS) experiments were performed on an Agilent 1260 HPLC system (Santa Clara, CA, 
USA
), which was coupled to an amaZon iontrap mass spectrometer (Bruker, 
Bremen
, 
Germany
). Elution was performed by maintaining 2% B for the first 11 min, followed by an increase to 50% B in 4 min, to 60% B in 17 min, and to 98% B in further 3 min; this composition was kept for additional 10 min, resulting in a total runtime of 45 min. The column was reequilibrated for 15 min prior to the next analysis. The DAD was set to 210, 254, 280, 310, 330, 350 and 
400 nm
, the flow rate, injection volume, and column temperature were adjusted to 0.60 mL/min, 5 μL, and 20 °C, respectively. MS-spectra were recorded in alternating-ESI mode (capillary voltage 4.5 kV), with a drying gas temperature of 200 °C, the nebulizer gas (nitrogen) set to 4.4 psi, and a nebulizer flow (nitrogen) of 6 L/min. The scanned mass range was set between m/z 100 and 1200.
