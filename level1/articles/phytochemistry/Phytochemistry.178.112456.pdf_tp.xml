The gene 
Lr34res
is one of the most long-lasting sources of quantitative fungal resistance in wheat. It is shown to be effective against leaf, stem, and stripe rusts, as well as powdery mildew and spot blotch. Recent biochemical characterizations of the encoded ABC transporter have outlined a number of allocrites, including phospholipids and abscisic acid, consistent with the established general promiscuity of ABC transporters, but ultimately leaving its mechanism of rust resistance unclear. Working with flag leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
L. variety ‘Thatcher’ (Tc) and a near-isogenic line of ‘Thatcher’ into which the 
Lr34res
allele was introgressed (Tc 
þLr34res
; RL6058), a comparative semi-targeted metabolomics analysis of flavonoid-rich extracts revealed virtually identical profiles with the exception of one metabolite accumulating in Tc 
þLr34res
, which was not present at comparable levels in Tc. Structural characterization of the purified metabolite revealed a phenylpropanoid diglyceride structure, 1- 
O - p
-coumaroyl-3- 
O
-feruloylglycerol (
CFG
). Additional profiling of 
CFG
across a collection of near-isogenic lines and representative 
Lr34
haplotypes highlighted a broad association between the presence of 
Lr34res
and elevated accumulations of 
CFG
. Depletion of 
CFG
upon infection, juxtaposed to its relatively lower anti-fungal activity, suggests 
CFG
may serve as a storage form of the more potent anti-microbial hydroxycinnamic acids that are accessed during defense responses. Altogether these findings suggest a role for the encoded 
LR34res
ABC transporter in modifying the accumulation of 
CFG
, leading to increased accumulation of anti-fungal metabolites, essentially priming the wheat plant for defense.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>As a result of their sessile nature, plants are exposed to an array of environmental stressors ranging from abiotic pressures such as salt, cold, heavy metal and heat, to biotic threats including nematodes and insects, as well as viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens. To address this, plants have developed complex networks of molecular and biochemical mechanisms to detect different stressors and defend itself against them.</p>
         <p>
Classically, responses to pathogens are described by the ‘zigzag’ model of plant immunity. In this model, the first level of defense is initiated upon perception of pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and MAMPs) and host damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS), by an array of plant receptors (

; 

). Perception of pathogens leads to pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) responses (

), against which some pathogens subsequently evolved effector proteins, which lead to increased susceptibility. 
A
second stronger level of effector-triggered immunity (ETI) defense responses is subsequently initiated, including expression of host resistance (R)-genes, that often initiates the hypersensitive response (

). However this model of plant immunity is now being revisited by reports highlighting overlap between the PAMPs/MAMPs and effectors, as well as between the receptors perceiving and eliciting PTI and ETI, such that a simplified model was recently proposed that refers simply to extracellularly and intracellularly triggered immunity (ExTI and InTI) (

). Notably, many of the above mentioned R-genes are linked to genetic loci that, when incorporated into germplasm, sometimes confer complete resistance to an array of diseases (

). However, while R-gene resistance is quantitatively strong, it lacks durability, and with time is generally overcome by shifts in pathogen populations (

).
</p>
         <p>
In contrast to this, alleles of a number of genetic loci have been correlated with more durable, albeit quantitative, adult-plant resistance (APR) against fungal pathogens in particular. One of the best characterized of these is 
Lr34,
with evaluation of breeding lines suggesting its effectiveness has been lasting for more than 100 years (

). This same 
Lr3
4 has most notably been effective against cereal rusts including leaf, stem, and stripe rusts (caused by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Puccinia triticina
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. graminis
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. striiformis
</tp:taxon-name>
, respectively), as well as powdery mildew and to a lesser extent spot blotch, the latter two caused by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Blumeria graminis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 

<tp:taxon-name>Bipolaris sorokiniana</tp:taxon-name>
,

respectively (

; 

; 

). The gene responsible for 
Lr34
resistance was cloned and found to encode an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter (

), with susceptible-associated (
Lr34sus
) and resistance-associated (
Lr34res
) alleles. These alleles are differentiated by a 3-nucleotide indel, resulting in deletion of a phenylalanine from the LR34Res protein that occurs at position 
546 in
the LR34Sus protein, and another single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) converting a tyrosine at LR34Res position 634 to a histidine. 

identified additional polymorphisms within 
Lr34
: an 
A
/T SNP in the fourth intron and a 1-nucleotide indel in the tenth exon causing a frameshift. Determination of the four 
Lr34
polymorphic positions in 653 wheat accessions defined four haplotypes, but only one of which was defined as the 
Lr34res
allele, conferring the 
Lr34
resistance phenotype. The presence of 
Lr34res
has been suggested to yield constitutive defense responses in the absence of pathogen (

; 

), including expression of genes linked to antimicrobial activity (proteases/chitinases), as well as constitutive expression of abscisic acid (ABA) -inducible responses (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
More recent studies investigated the transport characteristics of both the LR34Sus and LR34Res versions of the encoded ABC transporter proteins. Both LR34Sus and LR34Res were shown to elicit redistribution of certain membrane phospholipids, with impact on overall cellular lipid metabolism (

). However, the observed activities with respect to phospholipids were found to be true for both versions of the receptor, complicating possible interpretations with respect to associated mechanisms underlying the resistance elicited by the 
Lr34res
allele. At the same time, ABC transporters are notoriously promiscuous in substrate preferences, leaving the door open to alternatives (

). Another report, while falling short of conclusively identifying LR34Res and Lr34Sus transport substrates, demonstrated transport of a 618 Da wheat derived metabolite by LR34Sus, that was not transported by the LR34Res version of the transporter (

). Biophysical characterization suggested, albeit still to be validated, that this metabolite might fall into the category of fluorescent dioxobilin-type chlorophyll catabolites (

), consistent with 
Lr34res
being associated with a leaf-tip necrosis phenotype and senescence (

). However, lately both resistant and susceptible associated versions of the LR34 transporter were shown to mediate transport of ABA (

). The authors furthermore provide evidence supporting the possibility of differential regulation of the resistant and susceptible versions of LR 

34 
in

planta, either by post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms. However, the exact nature of the regulation remains to be elucidated, and the exact role of ABA in contributing to resistance remains enigmatic.
</p>
         <p>
To gain further insight into the nature of potential wheat 
Lr34res
- associated metabolites, a comparative semi-targeted metabolomics profiling strategy was implemented. Based on previous reports suggesting an association between 
Lr34res

<tp:taxon-name>
Triticum aestivum

L. (
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) variety ‘Thatcher’ (Tc) and the near-isogenic line (NIL) of ‘Thatcher’ into which the 
Lr34res
allele was introgressed (Tc 
þLr34res
; RL6058), outcomes of a comparative liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) analysis of flavonoid rich extracts are described, with an identified target structure validated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS). Additional screening of 
Lr34res
lines in the presence and absence of pathogen, compared to 
Lr34sus
lines, as well as the anti-fungal activity of the target and its associated metabolites, validated original outcomes and highlighted depletion of the target upon infection. Together these findings emphasize a possible role for 
Lr34res
in mediating rust resistance by enabling higher accumulation of anti-fungal phenylproponoid metabolites.

</title>
         <p>
A
comparative semi-targeted metabolomics profiling strategy was implemented, with a particular focus on the polyphenolic, flavonoid spectrum of metabolites. Plants were grown in growth chambers and flag leaves harvested post-anthesis, as the anthers were turning white (BBCH69 (

);). Working from the flag leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. aestivum
</tp:taxon-name>
variety ‘Thatcher’ (Tc) and the ‘Thatcher’ NIL RL6058 (Tc 
þ
Lr34res), a comparative liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopic (LC/MS) analysis of flavonoid rich extracts revealed highly similar, albeit not identical, profiles (
Fig. 1
). Proposed assignments for most of the detected peaks were tabulated based on retention time, UV-spectrophotometric 
λ
max
, and mass spectrometric 
m/z
values, compared to literature values (
Table 1
). In addition to the assigned flavonoid peaks, two major peaks were detected that could not be assigned and were named P1 and P2, respectively. Interestingly, the only difference detected between the profiles arising from the two wheat lines was at P2, which accumulated in RL6058, but was not present at comparable levels in Tc (

2.2. Structural characterization of the P2 metabolite from RL6058
(TcþLr34res NIL)
</title>
         <p>
Several milligrams of the P2 metabolite were collected from RL6058 flag leaves and concentrated to enable structural characterization. LC-UV analysis of the enriched metabolite yielded a major peak at 20.8 min (Supplemental 
Fig. S1A
), with the general spectral profile indicating a major band at 
315 nm
(Supplemental 
Fig. S1B
). LC/HRMS was conducted in the positive mode on the enriched sample. The high resolution mass spectrum (

Fig. S1A

C
(
Fig. 3
), as well as an HMBC (Supplemental 
Fig. S3
) providing correlations between carbons and protons that were separated by two, three, and sometimes in conjugated systems, four bonds were used for spin systems assignment. The HSQC showed 15 protonated carbons including 1 x 
CH

, 2 x 
CH

and the rest 
CH
. The chemical shift of the two equivalent 
CH
2
groups and the 
CH
at 4.28 and 4.15 ppm are typical for a sn-1,3 di-ester-substituted glycerol. This was confirmed from the HMBC correlations from 4.28 ppm to 169 ppm. HMBC correlations from the carbonyl carbon into the vinyl protons and then from vinyl carbons into the aromatic systems supported a dicinnamate 
type
of substituted glycerol. The 
C
2 spin systems in the aromatic region supported a 
p
-coumaroyl group on the glycerol. This was further supported by the HMBC correlations in the aromatic region. The correlation between the methyl protons at 3.87 ppm and the aromatic carbon at 114 ppm identified one of the groups as a feruloyl group. 
A
final assignment of carbon resonances, as well as a list of related proton resonances was compiled (

CFG
correlate with the presence of Lr34res,

but not Lr22a or Lr67res, and are depleted upon infection with leaf rust
</title>
         <p>
Subsequently, the accumulation of 
CFG
in Tc versus RL6058 lines in the presence and absence of infection by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Puccinia triticina
</tp:taxon-name>
isolate TDBG (11-180-1) was quantified. Plants were grown in growth chambers and inoculated with urediniospores at BBCH-61, with flag leaves sampled at time zero, and then once a week for 3.5 weeks (at 7, 14 and 24 days post inoculation (dpi)). The average detected accumulations of 
CFG
highlighted a lack of any significant interactions for the two lines tested with respect to infection condition or sample time (dpi), but a significant difference (
p
-value 
¼
0.0225) with respect to the observed increased accumulation of 
CFG
for RL6058 compared to Tc as an average of all samples in the experiment (
Fig. 4A

). In contrast, accumulations of 
CFG
for Tc 
þLr22a
or Tc 
þLr67res
NILs were not found to be significant (
p
-values 
¼
0.1965 and 0.9332 respectively) across all conditions compared to Tc (
Fig. 4B and C
; Supplemental 
Fig. S4
). Together these findings are consistent with the preliminary finding (
Fig. 1
) and support the correlation of the presence of 
Lr34res
with accumulation of 
CFG
.
</p>
         <p>
Unexpectedly, the data also revealed that the presence of the pathogen caused 
CFG
levels to plummet. This was found to hold true for all lines tested (including Tc, Tc 
þLr34res
, Tc 
þLr22a
and Tc 
þLr67res
) at seven dpi, and that levels remained low to the final time point at 24 dpi (

highlighted an interaction for each of the wheat lines tested with respect to sample time (dpi) which is expected (

2.4. Higher accumulations of 
CFG
correlate with the presence of Lr34res

more broadly
</title>
         <p>
To more generally assess the association between the accumulation of 
CFG
and the presence of the 
Lr34res
allele, the study was expanded to include quantitative profiling of 
CFG
across an array of 
Lr34
haplotype wheat accessions (

). Twenty-two accessions (
Table 3
) representing the five 
<tp:taxon-name>
major 
Lr
</tp:taxon-name>
34
haplotypes, where haplotype 1 corresponds to the 
Lr34res
allele, were grown in growth chambers and flag leaves harvested post-anthesis when the anthers were extruded (BBCH69). Following metabolite extraction, 
CFG
was quantified by LC/MS analysis with outcomes showing that the median average % total ion count (TIC) value for haplotype 1 ranged from two to five times higher than the medians for haplotypes 2–5 (
Fig. 5A
). While the data was not found to be significant (Kruskal-Wallis (non-parametric) analysis yielded a 
p
-value of 0.09), the trend is consistent with observations for the Tc 
þLr34res
NIL. Furthermore, when the study was expanded to include a selection of winter wheat lines (that do not contain the 
Lr34res
allele) with mixed rust resistance phenotypes (see methods and materials for details), no 
CFG
was detected for any cultivar (data not shown).
</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>
Finally, we evaluated the accumulation of 
CFG
in the flag leaves of five pairs of Sumai sibling lines (sibs) and both parental lines, with each pair of sibs consisting of 

Lr 
34þ

and 
Lr34-
counterparts validated by phenotypic assessment of leaf rust infection levels and resistance phenotype (
Table 4
). These were grown in the field, infected with leaf rust and harvested at maximum severity before senescence, while leaves were still green. Infected 

Lr 
34þ

Sumai lines (and the ‘Sumai 3’ parent) accumulated five-fold more 
CFG
than their 
Lr34-
counterparts or the Tc parent (
Fig. 5B
), again consistent with relative accumulations observed in Tc 
þLr34res
containing haplotype 1 plants in growth chambers (
Fig. 5A
). Further analysis emphasized that this relative difference between Sumai sibs was unique to 
CFG
, compared to other flavonoids in the original profile (for example 
Fig. 5C
).

2.5. Anti-fungal activity of 
CFG
and related compounds

</title>
         <p>
To understand the potential role of 
CFG
during infection, initially, the ability of 
CFG
to inhibit urediniospore germination was evaluated 
in vitro
. Isolates of presentative 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. triticina
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. striiformis
</tp:taxon-name>
were grown in the presence of 
CFG
, MeOH (control) or water (control), and the number of urediniospores germinated after 24 h were tabulated. The presence of 
CFG
significantly reduced 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. triticina
</tp:taxon-name>
urediniospore germination by ~20% (p&gt; 0.01) compared to control levels (
Fig. 6A
), while the MeOH solvent control had no effect compared to water. Albeit not as potent, similar observations were made in the independent experiment with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. striiformis
</tp:taxon-name>
, where 
CFG
elicited a significant 8% (p &lt;0.05) reduction in urediniospore germination rates (
Fig. 6B
).
</p>
         <p>
The possibility that 
CFG
, as well as its break down products (
Fig. 7A
), might have growth inhibitory activity against this causative agent of 
<tp:taxon-name>Fusarium</tp:taxon-name>
head blight, was also tested. Consistent with a prior report (

), ferulic acid (FA) maintained strong inhibitory activity against the growth of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. graminearum
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. 7B
), reducing colony diameters by ~ 80–90% compared to the control, across all three time points evaluated. Interestingly, coumaric acid (
CA
), feruloyl glycerol (
FG
) and 
CFG
all showed similar levels of significant reduction in fungal growth compared to the control (~65–70% compared to the control by day 3); however, their inhibitory effects were all weaker than FA. From a phenotypic perspective, it is also notable that colonies treated with 
CA
and FA were distinctly circular and smooth, compared to those treated with 
FG
and 
CFG
, which were more highly filamentous (
Fig. 7C
).

3. Discussion
</title>
         <p>
Despite its effective use in breeding for over 100 years (

), as well as its cloning (

) and the recent biochemical characterization of its encoded ABC transporter (

; 

; 

), the mechanism by which 
Lr34res
elicits its durable quantitative rust resistance remains to be fully understood. 
A
clearer picture of its molecular mechanism of action will allow more rational implementation of its use in breeding programs, most notably when it comes to stacking sources of resistance to enable the development of more durable qualitative resistance as fungal pathogens continue to change and adapt.
</p>
         <p>
To understand the effect of 
Lr34res
on plant metabolism, a semi-targeted metabolite profiling study was undertaken, based on a comparison of the (poly)phenolic/flavonoid families of metabolites in two NILs of wheat, Tc and Tc 
þLr34res
. This area of specialized metabolism was targeted based on documented roles for many of these 
types
of compounds in plant defense responses against various external stresses, including fungal pathogens (reviewed in 

; 

; 

). Interestingly, in the absence of pathogens, these NILs had virtually identical polyphenolic/flavonoid profiles, with the exception of the observed higher accumulation of the phenylpropanoid diglyceride, 
CFG
, in the 
Lr34res
line (
Fig. 1
).
</p>
         <p>
Phenylpropanoid diglycerides were first identified in what is considered to be a wild relative of cultivated wheat, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aegilops ovata
(
Cooper et al., 1978
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
CFG
in particular has been characterized across an array of other plants including, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Tillandsia streptocarpa
</tp:taxon-name>
, a South American herbaceous epiphyte with established natural anti-inflammatory activity (

), 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ananas comosus
</tp:taxon-name>
a popular tropical fruit (

) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sparganium stoloniferum
</tp:taxon-name>
, widely distributed in 
China
with anti-tumor activities (

). Phenylpropanoid diglycerides have been further identified in extracts from propolis, a product made by bees from plant exudates used in hive building, with documented antibacterial properties as well as putative antitumoral, antioxidative and immunomodulatory activities (reviewed in 

). The bioactivity of phenylpropanoid diglycerides has been patented (

) and some aspects of their biosynthesis elucidated (

). Interestingly, their overall structure is reminiscent of another well documented anti-microbial/anti-tumoral metabolite, curcumin (

). Thus, 
Lr34res
-associated increases in the accumulation of 
CFG
is entirely consistent with 
Lr34res
-associated resistance against multiple microbial pathogens (

; 

; 

).

</p>
         <p>
a

</p>
         <p>
The relevance of the anti-microbial activity of 
CFG
was specifically validated for fungal pathogens 
in vitro
(
Figs. 6
and 
7
). While the potency of 
CFG
was comparable to those of potential breakdown products 
FG
and 
CA
, it was significantly lower than FA. This is consistent with an earlier study in which FA was one of the most potent anti-fungal compounds against 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. graminaearum
</tp:taxon-name>
across an array of tested inhibitors (

). That a smaller specialized metabolite (FA), of which 
CFG
is in part comprised, has higher potency than 
CFG
itself, raises the hypothetical possibility of 
CFG
being a storage form of potent antifungal hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs). This idea would be consistent with the observed depletion of 
CFG
upon infection with rust regardless of 
Lr34res
(
Fig. 4
). While another explanation for depletion could be degradation as an energy source to address the high energy cost of defense (

), noted pathogen-induced induction of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes in a 
TcþLr34res
line (

), raises the question ‘why would a plant deplete 
CFG
for energy, while expending energy to make more of the same HCA’ s?’. Finally, these findings are consistent with other recent studies on FHB resistant quantitative trait loci (QTL), including 
Fhb2
and a second gene referred to as 
2DL
, that have been linked to accumulation of HCA-amides and other flavonoid-glycosides (

, b; 

; 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Importantly, the association of increased 
CFG
levels with 
Lr34res
was validated in a quantitative study that showed significantly higher accumulation of 
CFG
in Tc 
þLr34res
compared to Tc, an effect that was not detected in either Tc 
þLr22a
or Tc 
þLr67res
compared to Tc (
Fig. 4
). The correlation between 
Lr34res
and increased accumulation of 
CFG
was also observed in 

Lr 
34þ

Sumai lines compared to their 
LR34-
counterparts, even when grown in the field (
Fig. 5B
). Finally, although not deemed statistically significant, the 
Lr34res
containing haplotype 1 accessions yielded a 2–5 fold higher mean 
CFG
accumulation value compared to the susceptible haplotypes (
Fig. 5A
). Also consistent with this was the absence of 
CFG
in winter wheat accessions that lack 
Lr34res
. Thus the shear breadth of lines for which this hypothesis holds true argues against the possibility of the increased 
CFG
levels arising from any unlinked genes; although, these outcomes do not go as far as to discriminate between the possibilities of a direct effect of 
Lr34res
functionality versus an 
Lr34res
-linkage effect.
</p>
         <p>
With respect to increased accumulation of 
CFG
arising directly from functionalities of the encoded LR34res ABC transporter, the possibility of active transport of phenylpropanoid diglycerides, or related precursor/possible breakdown HCA metabolites such as ferulic and coumaric acids, remains to be tested. This is an attractive possibility considering the structural similarities between ABA (known LR34res allocrite; 

) and HCA, which include single modified six carbon rings with short acid carbon-chain tails. Alternatively, as proposed by others with respect to another APR-linked transporter (
Lr67res
; 

), accumulation of 
CFG
could be associated with inhibition of transport by LR34res, compared to LR34sus, such that more of the metabolites are retained within the plant cell, as a reserve for plant defense.
</p>
         <p>
That the accumulation of CFG’ s could instead be indirectly arising from documented functionalities of LR34res, including either phospholipid leaflet translocation or ABA transport activities and their associated induced gene responses, cannot be ignored (

; 

). ABA, which is produced by many fungal species (

) and has been linked to both susceptibility and resistance depending on the 
type
of pathogen (

), is generally thought to serve as a susceptibility factor (effector) in pathogenic plant-fungal interactions (for e.g. (

; 

; Asselbergh et al., 2007; 

; 

; 

); with some exceptions (e.g. 

)). On this basis one might speculate that increased transport of ABA, and associated ABA responses in 
Lr34res
plants (

; 

), represents a constitutive ABA-like priming effect, upregulating classical plant defense responses even in the absence of a pathogen (as discussed in (

)). However, ABA-induced upregulation of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic gene expression has not been highlighted across any global transcriptomic ABA-priming study to date (

; 

; 

; 

). At the same time any association between modulation of LR34res phospholipid translocation (

) and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is not expected based on currently documented pathways. As an aside, a recent report does link increased accumulation of the anti-fungal metabolite ergosterol to modulation of lipid biosynthetic genes in soybean (

). None-the-less, a more targeted full analysis of the modulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway across ABA-primed and lipid leaflet modulated transcriptomic data sets could better inform this aspect in the future.

4. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
This work highlights an association between the presence of 
Lr34res
and elevated accumulation of the phenylpropanoid diglyceride 
CFG
across an array of 
Lr34res
containing wheat lines, with the expected partial anti-fungal activity of 
CFG
validated against both 
<tp:taxon-name>
Puccinia
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Fusarium
</tp:taxon-name>
fungal pathogens. Its lower potency compared to individual HCAs of which it is composed, along with its observed depletion upon fungal infection, raise the new (to be tested) hypothesis of 
CFG
serving as a storage form of HCAs that the plant accesses during defense responses. 
A
review of the current literature highlights a number of possible functional roles for the LR34res ABC transporter in eliciting the accumulation of 
CFG
.These include i) direct transport of 
CFG
and/or the related HCA precursors/breakdown metabolites; ii) inhibition of the transport of these same metabolites; or iii) indirect modulation of the biosynthesis of these metabolites by signaling effects elicited by known allocrites of LR34res (

; 

). Ongoing work includes a transcriptomic analysis of the Tc and Tc 
þLr34res
wheat in the presence and absence of leaf rust infection to shed additional light on the status of HCA, phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways in 
Lr34res
wheat, as well as associations between these observations and LR34’s recently demonstrated ABA and lipid transport functionalities.

The inoculum was placed into a gel capsule, connected to an air assisted spray manifold and target tissues were sprayed until an even oil film was observed over the area. The plants were kept at room temperature for an hour until the oil film disappeared and then transferred to a dark dew chamber for 24 h and then to a regular growth chamber, with the light and temperature settings as described above. For consistency across experiments, the flag leaves were collected post-anthesis, 
i.e.
when the spike was at maturity with anthers turning white (BBCH-69). Flag leaves were cut, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80

C
. For each line tested, four biological replicates, with a minimum of 3–4 flag leaves being harvested from 3 individual plants per biological replicate, hence a total of 12–16 flag leaves from 12 plants per line profiled. For experiments where plants were inoculated with the pathogen (and controls for these experiments), flag leaves were sampled at infection time zero (BBCH-61), and once a week for 3.5 weeks.
