1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Croton
(Euphorbiaceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
, comprises about 1300 species distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world (

). A number of species are used as traditional medicines for various conditions, including gastric diseases (

), snake bites (

), wound healing (

; 

), rheumatism and ulcers (

; 

), diarrhoea and cancer (

), malaria (

), chest complaints (

), diabetes, gastrointestinal disturbances and high cholesterol (

). The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Croton
</tp:taxon-name>
has been shown to produce a range of compounds including terpenoids, alkaloids and flavonoids, some of which have been shown to possess anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, anti-malarial and anti-oxidant activities (

). In our studies of African 
<tp:taxon-name>
Croton
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, we have isolated a wide range of diterpenoid classes including cembranoids (

; Mulholland et al., 2010), crotofolanes, halimanes, 
ent
-clerodanes (

), abietanes (

) and 
ent
-kaurenoic acids (

). We report on the isolation of twelve 
ent
-abietanes (
1–12
) and two 
ent
-pimaranes (
13
, 
14
), of which compounds 
2–5
, 
8
, 
9
and 
14
and the 
ent
-form of compounds 
6
, 
7
, 
10
, 
11
and 
12
have not been reported previously, from the leaf extract of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Croton mubango
Müll. Arg. (Euphorbiaceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
, collected in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo
. Absolute configurations of isolated compounds were confirmed using ECD spectroscopy and DP4+ calculations.

         <p>
The leaves of

, yielded twelve previously unreported diterpenoids, eleven belonging to the

, and an 
ent
-pimarane, 
ent
-pimara-8(14),15-dien-3-one 
14
(
Fig. 1
), along with known compounds, 
ent
-abieta-7,13-dien-3-one 
1
(

; 

), 3α-hydroxy- 
ent
-pimara-8(14),15-diene 
13
(

), 2-phyten-1-ol (

), caryophyllene oxide (

), 13 
2
-hydroxy-(13 
2
- 
S
)- phaeophytin-a (

), sitosterol and sitosterone. The normal series analogues of the newly isolated 
ent
-diterpenoids 
6
(

), 
7
(

), 
10
(

), 
11
(

) and 
12
(

; 

), have been reported previously. Structures of the known compounds were confirmed by comparison with data from literature as referenced above and NMR literature data for 
1
was corrected (
Tables 1
and 
2
). The absolute configurations of 
1
, 
2
, 
4
and 
14
were determined through the comparison of their experimental and theoretically calculated ECD curves. This was achieved using previously described protocols (

; 

), where conformational searches of 
1
, 
2
, 
4
and 
14
and their enantiomers were initially undertaken using Spartan software at ground state with molecular mechanics force fields (MMFF). Conformers that were under 3 kcal/mol were subjected to TDDFT calculations using a B3LYP method at 6-31G** level built into Gaussian software (

). This work represents only the second report of 
ent
-abietane diterpenoids from an African 
<tp:taxon-name>
Croton
species
</tp:taxon-name>
: two 
ent
-abietane diterpenoids, 
ent
-abieta-7,13-dien-2-one and 2β-hydroxy- 
ent
-abieta-7,13- diene, were isolated previously from the Kenyan 
<tp:taxon-name>
Croton megalocarpus
(
Alqahtani, 2015
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Ent-
pimarane diterpenoids are reported here for the first time from an African 
<tp:taxon-name>
Croton
species.
</tp:taxon-name>
Previously abietane diterpenoids have demonstrated antiulcer, antimicrobial and cardiovascular activities (

). Leaves of the Brazilian 
<tp:taxon-name>
Croton sphaerogynus
</tp:taxon-name>
have shown antiproliferative activity, believed to be caused by the presence of abietanes (

). Tricyclic diterpenes have also shown promising anti-proliferative activities (

; 

), therefore compounds 
2
, 
2Ac
, 
3
, 
4
, 
7Ac
, 
8
, 
9
, 
10Ac
, 
12
and 
14
were submitted to the NCI Drug Therapeutics Programme for evaluation in the NCI 60 cancer cell line screen at one dose of 1 × 10 
−5
M (

) (see 
Table 3
).

Compound 
1
was found to be the known 
ent
-abieta-7,13-dien-3-one, isolated previously from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Juniperus phoenicea
(
Feliciano et al., 1993a
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Solidago missouriensis
(
Anthonse and Bergland, 1973
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. Using 2D NMR techniques, we were able to correct literature NMR assignments (
Tables 1
and 
2
). The NOESY spectrum confirmed the relative stereochemistry with correlations seen between the H-9/H-5 and H-5/H 
3
-18 resonances, and H 
3
-19 and H 
3
-20 resonances. In order to determine the absolute configuration of 
1
, its theoretically calculated and experimental ECD curves were compared. ECD spectroscopy showed the n-π* transition at 
290 nm
(ΔE = +6) and negative Cotton effects at 
205 nm
(ΔE = −16) and at 
197 nm
(ΔE = −18) indicating 
1
was an 
ent
- abietane (

). To confirm this, the theoretical excitation circular dichroism (ECD) spectrum of 
1
was compared to the experimental ECD spectrum. A conformational search on the (5 
S,
9 
S,
10 
S
)-isomer of 
1
using Spartan software to evaluate the conformer distribution at ground state with molecular mechanics force fields (MMFF) was undertaken. MMFF analysis of 
1
(of the 
ent
diterpenoid series) gave six conformers, three of which were under 3 kcal/mol. The three conformers, consistent with NOESY NMR experimental data, M0001 (0.00 kcal/mol), M0002 (0.29 kcal/mol) and M0003 (0.41 kcal/mol), had Boltzmann distributions of 
0.473
, 
0.288
and 0.238 respectively. Each of these three conformers was subjected to TDDFT calculations using a B3LYP method at 6-31G** level built into Gaussian 09 software (

). The ECD curves for the three conformers were Boltzmann weighted and compared to the experimental ECD curve of 
1
(
Fig. 2
) which enabled the unambiguous assignment of the chiral centres of 
1
as 5 
S
, 9 
S
and 10 
S
. To confirm this assignment, a theoretical ECD spectrum for the normal-enantiomer (
1a
) of 
1
, also consistent with the NOESY NMR experimental data (5 
R
, 9 
R
and 10 
R
) was obtained. The theoretical ECD curve of 
1a
was opposite and equal in intensity to that of 
1
, confirming 
1
was 
ent-
abieta-7,13-dien-3-one. As a plant normally produces compounds of either the normal or 
ent
-series, it was expected that all the abietanes isolated in this work belong to the 
ent
-series and this was confirmed by ECD analysis of compounds 
1
, 
2
, 
4
and 
14
(
Fig. 2
).

The HRESIMS for compound 
2
showed an [M-H] 
-
ion at 
m/z
301.2171, indicating a molecular formula of C 
20
H 
30
O 
2
for the compound and six degrees of unsaturation. The FTIR spectrum showed peaks at 
3429 cm
−1
(O–H stretch) and 
1714 cm
−1
(ketone C
]
O stretch). As with compound 
1
, a keto group carbon resonance (
δC
216.5) was assigned as C-3 due to correlations seen in the HMBC spectrum with the H-5 (
δH
1.67, dd, 
J
= 5.0 Hz, 12.0 Hz), H 
3
-18 (
δH
1.14), and H 
3
-19 (
δH
1.19) resonances. The 
13
C NMR spectrum showed the presence of a conjugated 7,13-diene system with resonances at 
δC
120.3 (C-7), 
δC
135.3 (C-8), 
δC
146.3 (C-13) and 
δC
122.1 (C-14), confirmed by correlations seen in the HMBC spectrum between the C-5 (
δC
52.5) and H-7 (
δH
5.45 bs, W 
1/2
= 11.0 Hz), and C-9 (
δC
50.4) and both H-7 and H-14 (
δH
5.80, bs, W 
1/2
= 5.0 Hz) resonances and correlations seen in the COSY spectrum between H-5/H 
2
-6 (
δH
2.12 m
, 
δH
2.21 m
), and the H-7 alkene resonance. The C-13 resonance showed correlations with the H 
3
-16 and H 
3
-17 resonances (
δH
1.00, 
δH
1.01, both d, 
J
= 7.0 Hz) confirming the isopropyl group at C-13 and hence the abietane structure. The 
1
H NMR chemical shifts differed from those of compound 
1
with oxymethine resonances at 
δC
69.2 and 
δH
4.61 (dd, 
J
= 6.0, 13.0 Hz) and a hydroxy group was placed at C-2 due to correlations seen between the oxymethine proton resonance and the C-1 (
δC
48.2), C-3 (
δC
216.5), C-4 (
δC
47.4) and C-10 (
δC
35.6) resonances in the HMBC spectrum. The configuration at C-2 was assigned using the NOESY spectrum, which showed correlations between the H 
3
-20, H 
3

was acetylated to produce the 2β-acetyl derivative,

, which showed the expected downfield shift of the H-2α resonance to 
δH
5.62. The absolute configuration of

was confirmed by comparing the theoretically calculated ECD and the experimental ECD data, as was done for

(

HRESIMS of compound

the

H NMR spectra of

were replaced by singlets at 
δH
1.35 and 
δH
1.33, and a fully substituted oxygenated carbon resonance which could be assigned to C-15 was present at 
δC
72.7. Thus the structure of 
3
was assigned as 15- 
hydroxyent
-abieta-7,13-dien-3-one.

H

O 
3
for the compound. As with compound 
3
, compound 
4
had a keto group at C-3 (
δC
216.8) and a tertiary hydroxy group at C-15 (
δC
74.9). The 
13
C NMR spectrum showed the presence of one tri-substituted 8(14)-double bond (
δC
143.1, C-8; 
δC
124.3, C-14), confirmed by a correlation seen between the C-9 (
δC
50.4) and C-15 (
δC
74.9) resonances and the alkene H-14 broad resonance (
δH
5.82). A second tertiary hydroxy group was placed at C-13 (
δC
74.3) due to correlations seen in the HMBC spectrum between this resonance and the H 
3
-16 and H 
3
-17 singlet resonances (
δH
1.14, 
δH
1.22). The configuration at C-13 was determined as 
S
by rerunning NMR spectra in DMSO which enabled a correlation to be seen between the 13-OH proton resonance (
δH
3.87) and the H 
3
-20 resonance (
δH
0.93) in the NOESY spectrum, allowing assignment of the hydroxyl group as α (
Fig. 4
). The absolute configuration of 
4
was also assigned as for 
1
and 
2
using ECD spectroscopy (
Fig. 2
).

was similar to compound 
2
with a keto group at C-3, hydroxy group at C-2β, a C-7 double bond and an isopropyl group at C-13 with H 
3
-16 and H 
3
-17 doublets (
δH
0.98, 0.96, ea d, 
J
= 7.0 Hz) seen to be coupled to a H-15 septet (
δH
1.91). The two H-14 resonances (
δH
1.80, superimposed) showed correlations in the HMBC spectrum with the C-7 (
δC
127.9), C-8 (
δC
143.4), C-13 oxygenated carbon (
δC
79.7), C-15 (
δC
32.3) and a further oxygenated fully substituted carbon resonance (
δC
80.7) which was assigned as C-9. For 
5
, correlations were observed in the NOESY spectrum between the H-5/ H 
3
-18 and H 
3
-19/H 
3
-20 resonances, but did not allow us to establish the configuration at C-9 and C-13 (
Fig. 5
). As a result, four isomers were possible (
Table 5
). The configuration at C-9 and C-13 for compound 
5
were determined by calculating the DP4+ probability of the possible isomers following the protocol previously described (

; 

). This method computes NMR shifts of isomeric compounds using quantum chemical calculations, which are then compared to the experimental NMR data in order to establish the stereochemistry of isomeric compounds (

). The overall results indicated that the (9 
R
,13 
R
)-isomer of 
5
was the most likely isomer (
Table 5
). Despite the 
1
H-DP4+ probability calculation initially suggesting the (9 
R
,13 
S
)-isomer as the correct isomer, this was outweighed by the contribution made by 
13
C-DP4+ data, which led to the final assignment of (9 
R
, 13 
R
) for 
5
. Such discrepancies between 
1
H-and 
13
C-DP4+ data were analysed by Grimblat et al. and were rationalized that a combined analysis corrects the anomaly. In the different compounds of known stereochemistry examined in their case study, the misassignments were corrected when including both sets (
1
H and 
13
C) of data in the probability calculations (see 
Table 4
).

δH
6.92, bs, W

Compound 
7
was found to be the 7β-hydroxy derivative of compound

δH
1.25 m

δC
44.1 compared to 
δC
50.9 in
compound 
6
) due to the γ-gauche effect indicated that the hydroxy group at C-7 was βaxial (

3
-20 (
δH

δC
46.7) and C-10 (
δC
38.3) resonances in the HMBC spectrum. As with compound 
2
, the hydroxy group was placed at C-2β due to correlations seen in the NOESY spectrum between the H-2α resonance and the H 
3
-20 and H 
3
-19 resonances (
Fig. 6
).
</p>

10
was identified as the 3α-hydroxy derivative of

ent
-abieta-8,11,13-triene. The H-3 resonance occurred at 
δH
3.30 (dd, 
J

Compound 
13
was found to be the known 3α-hydroxy- 
ent
-pimara-8(14),15-diene (

), and compound 
14
was found to be its 3-keto derivative. A keto group (
δC

δH
1.46) and H 
3
-18 (
δH
1.10) and H 
3
-19 (
δH
1.07) resonances in the HMBC spectrum. The NOESY spectrum showed correlations between the H

-18 and H-5, H-5 and H-9, and H-9 and H 
3
-17 resonances, and also between the H 
3
-20 and H 
3
-19 resonances, implying that they are on the same side of the molecule (
Fig. 7
). The ECD spectrum showed Cotton effects at 
290 nm
(ΔE = +3), at 
205 nm
(ΔE = −49) and at 
192 nm
(ΔE = −45), which were the same as those reported for 17-hydroxy- 
ent
-pimara-8(14),15- dien-3-one (

ent
-pimarane series. The absolute configuration of
