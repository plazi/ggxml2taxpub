Root nodule metabolism is highly specialized. Within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Alnus
</tp:taxon-name>
infected cells, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Frankia
</tp:taxon-name>
is supplied with malate by the host plant (

) and exports the fixed nitrogen to the cytosol in the form of ammonia (

). The exported ammonium is assimilated and transported to the xylem mainly in the form of citrulline (

). Citrulline is the main amino acid found in roots and nodules (

; 

). Altogether, the primary metabolism in nodules is well known, while the specialized metabolites in actinorhizal nodules have yet to be characterized. As part of our ongoing phytochemical research on root nodules to provide chemical understanding of actinorhizal symbiosis (

), we investigated the constituents of 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
</tp:taxon-name>
root nodules and identified four 3-pentanol glycosides, including three undescribed ones. In addition, the distribution of 3-pentanol glycosides was studied.

Compound 2, obtained as a colourless oil, was found to have the molecular formula 
C
16
H 
30
O 
10
from pseudo-molecular ions at 
m/z
405 [M+Na] 
+
in positive electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), 
m/z
417 [M+Cl] and 381 [M H] in negative ESI-MS, and 
m/z
405.1733 [M+Na]

in high-resolution (HR)-ESI-MS (calcd. for 
C
16
H 
30
O 
10
Na 
+
: 405.1737). The 
13
C
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum (
Table 2
) displayed 16 carbons, including two anomeric carbons (
δ
103.4 and 109.8) indicating the presence of two monosaccharides and a group of signals (
δ
10.1, 9.7, 28.0, 27.0, and 83.2) indicating the ether linkage with 3-pentanol, which was similar to compound 1. One distinct difference was that the 
1
H and 
13
C
NMR spectra of compound 2 showed an additional monosaccharide. After detailed comparison with literature values, the additional monosaccharide was identified as arabinose. The glycosidic linkage between C-1 
′′
of arabinose and C-6 
′
of glucose was assigned according to the heteronuclear multiple bond correlations (HMBCs) from H-6 
′
(
δ
3.62 and 4.01) of glucose to C-1 
′′
(
δ
109.8) of arabinose (
Fig. 2
). Additionally, the HMBC from H-1 
′
(
δ
4.33) to C-3 (
δ
83.2) of 3-pentanol supported the glycosidic linkages of glucose and 3-pentanol. 
α
-Arabinose was confirmed on the basis of the anomeric proton doublet at 
δ
H
5.00, with a small 
3
J
H-1,H-2
coupling constant (1.3 Hz). Similarly, 
β
-glucose was identified based on the observation of an anomeric proton doublet at 
δ
H
4.33 with a large 
3
J
H-1,H-2
coupling constant (7.7 Hz). Furthermore, acid hydrolysis (

) of compound 2 released D- glucose (
tR
= 20.2 min) and L- arabinose (
tR
= 22.4 min), which were detected after derivatisation by comparison of their retention time (
tR
) with derivatively authentic D- glucose (
tR
= 20.3 min) and L- glucose (
tR
= 18.7 min) and with derivatively authentic D- arabinose (
tR
= 23.3 min) and L- arabinose (
tR
= 22.5 min) in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis (
Fig. S2
), respectively. Therefore, compound 2 was identified as 3-pentyl 
α
-L- arabinofuranosyl-(1 
′′

′
)- 
β
-D -glucopyranoside.

H 
32
O 
10
based on pseudo-molecular ions at 
m/z
419 [M+Na] 
+
in positive ESI-MS and 
m/z
395 [M H] in negative ESI-MS. After structure determination of 1 and 2, it was found that the 
1
H and 
13
C
NMR spectra (
Tables 1
and 
2
) of compound 3 displayed a group of signals (
δ
10.2, 9.8, 28.2, 27.3 and 83.3) indicating the presence of 3-pentanol as well as two anomeric carbons (
δ
103.7 and 102.2) and a secondary methyl (
δ
H
1.01 and 
δ
C

18.0) indicating the presence of glucose and rhamnose. The ether linkage between 3-pentanol and glucose was the same as that in compounds 1 and 2. The glycosidic linkage between C-1 
′′
of rhamnose and C-6 
′
of glucose was assigned according to the HMBCs from H-6 
′
(
δ
3.59 and 3.96) of glucose to C-1 
′′
(
δ
102.2) of rhamnose (
Fig. 2
). 
α
-Rhamnose and 
β
-glucose were confirmed on the basis of an anomeric proton doublet at 
δ
H
4.75 with a small 
3
J
H-1,H-2
coupling constant (1.5 Hz) and an anomeric proton doublet at 
δ
H
4.29 with a large 
3
J
H-1,H-2
coupling constant (7.8 Hz), respectively. Furthermore, acid hydrolysis (

) of compound 3 released D- glucose (
tR
= 20.1 min) and L- rhamnose (
tR
= 22.0 min), which were detected after derivatisation by comparison of their retention time (
tR
) with derivatively authentic D- glucose (
tR
=20.3 min) and L- glucose (
tR
=18.7 min) and with derivatively authentic L- rhamnose (
tR
= 22.2 min) in HPLC analysis (
Fig. S2
), respectively. Finally, compound 3 was identified as 3-pentyl 
α
-L- rhamnopyranosyl-(1 
′′
→6 
′
)- 
β
-D- glucopyranoside.

Compound 4, obtained as a colourless oil, was assigned the molecular formula of 
C
17
H 
30
O 
10
by positive HR-ESI-MS (
m/z
[M+Na] 
+
417.1738, calcd. for

: 417.1737). The 
13
C
NMR spectrum (
Table 2
) displayed 17 carbons, including one anomeric carbon (
δ
103.4) indicating the presence of one monosaccharide and a group of signals (
δ
10.1, 9.8, 28.0, 27.1 and 83.2) indicating the ether linkage with 3- pentanol, as well as two carbonyl carbons (
δ
172.4 and 174.9). Detailed NMR analysis of compound 4 led to the observation of 3-pentanol, glucose, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate groups, which was similar to compounds 1 and 5. Further analyses showed that compound 4 was a structural combination of compounds 1 and 5. The ester linkage between C-1 
′′
of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate (5) and C-6 
′
of glucose was determined according to the HMBCs from H-6 
′
(
δ
4.05 and 4.30) of glucose to C-1 
′′
(
δ
172.4) of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate (5) (
Fig. 2
). Considering that acid hydrolysis of co-occurred compounds 1–3 released D- glucose, glucose in compound 4 was proposed to have the same D- configuration as those in compounds 1–3. Consequently, compound 4 was identified as 3-pentyl 6 
′
-(3-hydroxy3-methylglutaryl)- 
β
-D- glucopyranoside.

The seventeen known compounds were identified as 3-pentyl

-D- xylopyranoside (18) (Chen, J. et al., 2000), alnuside 
A
(19) (

), and alnuside B (20) (

) (
Fig. S3
), by comparison of spectroscopic data with values reported in the literature. Although 3-pentyl 
β
-D- glucopyranoside (1) is a known compound, it was previously reported only as an artificially synthesised molecule (

). The natural occurrence of 3-pentanol glycosides is here reported for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Besides 3-pentanol glycosides, the main components in root nodules of 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
</tp:taxon-name>
are diarylheptanoids, which are characteristic components of alder plants (

; 

; 

; 

). Compounds 8–11 and 14–20 isolated in this study from 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
</tp:taxon-name>
root nodules, have been also reported in other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Alnus

</tp:taxon-name>
(

), and are assumed to be of plant origin. Bacteriohopanetetrol (13) is a bacterial hopanoid, which has been abundantly found in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Alnus
</tp:taxon-name>
nodules (

). The phytosterol 
β
-sitosterol (8), taraxerone (9), 22-hydroxyhopane (12), lupenone (10) and lupeol (11) representing lupane-type triterpenes, were also isolated from root nodules of actinorhizal

2.2. Distribution of 3-pentanol glycosides
</title>
         <p>
After sulfuric acid hydrolysis of 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
</tp:taxon-name>
leaves, stems, fruits, root nodules, and roots, 3-pentanol was quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as total content. The content of free 3- pentanol was also quantified in the samples without sulfuric acid hydrolysis, of which the results are shown in 
Fig. 3A
. The content of free 3- pentanol in root nodules and roots were 9.5 and 0.8 μmol/g (
FW
), respectively, while it was not detected in leaves, stems and fruits. The difference values between the total and free content indicated the content of 3-pentanol released from glycosides, which could be featured as the content of 3-pentanol glycosides. The results are shown in 
Fig. 3B
. The content of 3-pentanol glycosides varied greatly among the different organs. The contents of 3-pentanol glycosides in leaves, stems, fruits, root nodules, and roots were 1.0 μmol/g (
FW
), 3.5 μmol/g (
FW
), 0 μmol/ g (
FW
), 120.7 μmol/g (
FW
), and 2.6 μmol/g (
FW
), respectively. The results show that 3-pentanol glycosides are abundantly distributed in root nodules, while they are distributed in leaves, roots and stems at low level. By contrast, 3-pentanol glycosides are not detected in fruits.

<tp:taxon-name>A. cremastogyne</tp:taxon-name>
plants treated by root nodule suspension emit 3- pentanol

The 
<tp:taxon-name>
Frankia
</tp:taxon-name>
microsymbiont from 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
</tp:taxon-name>
root nodules could not be isolated. Therefore, root nodule suspension (RNS) containing 
<tp:taxon-name>
Frankia
</tp:taxon-name>
was used for infection. The emission of volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) by 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
plants
</tp:taxon-name>
in response to infection was detected through solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) GC-MS. 3-Pentanol was detected both in VOCs released by 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
plants
</tp:taxon-name>
treated with root nodule suspension (RNS) and by control RNS, while it was not detected in the VOCs released by control 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. 4A
). The emitted amounts of 3-pentanol in the VOCs released by 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
</tp:taxon-name>
treated with RNS increased from 0 to 12 h, whereas 3-pentanol emissions decreased in the VOCs released by control RNS during the same time period. This result indicated that the 3-pentanol in RNS-treated 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
</tp:taxon-name>
was formed by the plants, not by the bacteria in the RNS. The accumulated 3-pentanol in leaves and roots of 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
</tp:taxon-name>
was quantified after exposure to RNS for 12 h. 3-Pentanol was detected in both leaves and roots of 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
</tp:taxon-name>
treated with RNS, while it was not detected in either leaves or roots of control plants (
Fig. 4B
). The accumulated amounts of 3-pentanol in RNS-treated leaves and roots of 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
</tp:taxon-name>
were 172.7 nmol/g (FW) and 134.4 nmol/g (FW), respectively (
Fig. 4C
).
</p>
         <p>
RNS induces the accumulation and emission of 3-pentanol in 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
</tp:taxon-name>
. It was reported that 3-pentanol primes plant immunity in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Arabidopsis
(
Song et al., 2015
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, cucumber (

) and pepper (

), and is present as an attractant in volatile emissions from the ambrosia beetle 
<tp:taxon-name>
Megaplatypus mutatus
(
Gatti Liguori et al., 2008
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. It was tempting to speculate that 3-pentanol plays a role as a signaling molecule in the infection process between 
<tp:taxon-name>
Frankia
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. cremastogyne
</tp:taxon-name>
. It is interesting to look at all the expressed genes in response to 3-pentanol by a global transcriptomic approach (RNA-seq), and to verify specific expressed genes by reverse transcription – quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for further study.

4.4. Acid hydrolysis of compounds 1–3
</p>
         <p>
Acid hydrolysis was conducted following the procedures described by 

. Compounds 1–3 (each 
1 mg
) were dissolved in 5 mL of 2 M aqueous hydrochloride and refluxed at 100 
◦
C
for 4 h. After removal of the solution under vacuum, 5 mL distilled water was added and then partitioned with 5 mL ethyl acetate three times. The aqueous layer was condensed to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in 1 mL pyridine containing 
1 mg
/mL L-cysteine methyl ester hydrochloride. After the solution was heated at 60 
◦
C
for 1 h, 
O
-tolylisothiocyanate (2 mL) was added, and the solution was maintained at 60 
◦
C
for an additional 1 h and then condensed to dryness under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in 1 mL MeOH and analysed by HPLC with two Shimadzu LC-20AT pumps, a Shimadzu SPD-M20 
A
diode array detector, and a Shimadzu SIL-20 
A
auto sampler using an Agilent Zorbax SB-Aq column (5 μm, 4.6 × 
250 mm
); acetonitrile (
CH
3
CN)/H 
2
O/acetic acid (22:78:0.1) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min for 60 min, and the column was then washed with 90% aqueous 
CH
3
CN. D- Glucose, L- arabinose, and L- rhamnose in the acid hydrolysates were detected by comparison of their 
tR
values with those of authentic D- glucose (
tR
=20.3 min), L- glucose (
tR
= 18.7 min), D- arabinose (
tR
= 23.3 min), L- arabinose (
tR
=22.5 min), and L- rhamnose (
tR
=22.2 min), which were hydrolysed by acid using the same procedures.
