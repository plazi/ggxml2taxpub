1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Nepetalactone (NL) is a major compound sequestered in the glandular trichomes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Nepeta
species
</tp:taxon-name>
(fam. 
<tp:taxon-name>Lamiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
). In natural sources, this iridoid monoterpene is present in the form of 7S diastereoisomers (

), and their qualitative and quantitative content is species-specific. Many 
<tp:taxon-name>
Nepeta
species
</tp:taxon-name>
are well known for their pharmacological properties and are widely used in folk medicine as diuretic, diaphoretic, anti-tussive, anti-spasmodic, anti-asthmatic, febrifuge and sedative agents, against gastrointestinal and respiratory hyperactive disorders (

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

). They also show phytotoxic and allelopathic effects (

, 

; 

), and display behavioural effect on cats (

), and repellent activity (

; 

; 

). Although the biological activities of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Nepeta
species
</tp:taxon-name>
have been thoroughly investigated and usually ascribed to nepetalactones, the biosynthesis of these compounds on the molecular level is not entirely understood.
</p>
         <p>
It has been proposed that NLs are derived throughout the general iridoid pathway, from geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) produced by the MEP pathway, which arises in a reaction catalysed by geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Nepeta
species
</tp:taxon-name>
share part of the monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) pathway with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Catharanthus roseus
</tp:taxon-name>
up to 8-oxogeranial. The chain of reactions starts with geraniol synthase (GES) converting GPP to geraniol, which is then oxidized to 8-hydroxygeraniol in a reaction catalysed by geraniol 8-oxidase (G8 
O
) (

). Subsequent oxidation of 8-hydroxygeraniol to yield dialdehyde 8-oxogeranial in 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. roseus
</tp:taxon-name>
is catalysed by 8-hydroxygeraniol oxidoreductase (8-HGO) (

; 

). The activity of 8-HGO has previously been confirmed for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Nepeta racemosa
(
Hallahan et al., 1995
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. The reaction that catalyses iridoid synthase (
IS
) was first described in 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. roseus
</tp:taxon-name>
(Geu 
Flores
et al., 2012). The two 
IS
homologs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. mussinnii
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. cataria
</tp:taxon-name>
have recently been functionally characterized (

). It has been shown that ISs of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Nepeta
species
</tp:taxon-name>
are responsible for the stereoselective 1,4- reduction of 8-oxogeranial (

, 

; 

). After forming the uncyclised and reactive enolate via ISmediated reduction, this intermediate is then cyclised to 
<tp:taxon-name>form nepetalactol</tp:taxon-name>
by NAD-dependent nepetalactol-related short-chain-dehydrogenases/reductases (NEPSs) (

, 

). Although an enzyme with NAD 
+
oxidoreductase activity has been purified from 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. racemosa
</tp:taxon-name>
leaves a long time ago (

), only recently three enzymes which control the formation of nepetalactol have been identified and functionally characterized from 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. mussinii
(
Lichman et al., 2019a
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, NEPS1, NEPS2, and NEPS3. Apparently, NEPS1 is essential for the conversion of nepetalactol into NL.
</p>
         <p>
The pools of bioactive compounds in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Nepeta
species
</tp:taxon-name>
are shaped by the external environmental factors. It has been reported that some 
<tp:taxon-name>
Nepeta
species
</tp:taxon-name>
modulate their essential oil content in response to drought and water stress (

; 

; 

). Some 
<tp:taxon-name>
Nepeta
species
</tp:taxon-name>
are considered attractive horticultural and medicinal crops in semi-arid areas, due to their adaptation to drought conditions and high production of essential oils. Many of them have previously been introduced into cultivation under extreme growth conditions, including

<tp:taxon-name>
Nepeta argolica

usually grows in dry stony places, rocky habitats, and scree of 
Greece
(

), while 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
inhabits calcareous stony grounds on the southern slopes of Mt Rtanj in SE 
Serbia
(

). Although closely related, two model species display differential qualitative and quantitative content of NLs, with 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
being a rich source of 
trans,cis
-NL, and dehydronepetalactone (DNL), while in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. argolica
ssp. 
argolica
</tp:taxon-name>
the major iridoid is 
cis,trans
-NL (

). As water availability is the major challenge in natural habitats of the two species, it is essential to understand its effect on growth performance, overall physiology and water relations, leaf surface morphology, as well as on the NL metabolism. This is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to investigate the molecular background of the NL biosynthesis as influenced by dehydration stress, through evaluating the expression of metabolic pathway genes and regulatory genetic elements-transcription factors (TFs), in parallel with metabolic profiling.

plants (an average of 65% and 72%, respectively) were recorded in non-treated plants and they were relatively stable throughout the experiment.

<tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>
N. argolica

fragments of NL and DNL in the positive ionization mode are presented within

λ

, which suggested the presence of a pyrone moiety in DNL (Ross, 1953), the conjugated lactone function with extended conjugation. Some previous studies revealed that nepetalactones in 
<tp:taxon-name>

are usually present in the form of more than one isomer (reviewed in

conditions, which might significantly influence the specialized metabolism, it is not surprising that minor nepetalactones in these species were not recorded with the adopted analytical techniques.

A
significant initial reduction of 
trans,cis
-NL and DNL was observed in PEG-treated 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
plants at 1DPT (~1.3 and ~1.4 fold, respectively) in comparison with the non-treated plants (
Fig. 2c and d
). This reduction was not statistically significant at 3DPT and 6DPT for 
trans,cis
-NL and at 6DPT for DNL. In words of absolute content, 
trans,cis
-NL slightly increases during the 6 days of PEG treatment, while DNL content decreases (
Fig. S1a and S1b
). The reduction in the content of 
cis,trans
-NL (~2 fold) in PEG-treated 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. argolica
ssp. 
argolica
</tp:taxon-name>
plants was significant at 1DPT, 3DPT and 6DPT when compared to non-treated plants (
Fig. 2h and i
). The amount of DNL was more influenced by PEG-treatment than was the amount of 
cis,trans
-NL. The reduction in DNL content was significant at 1DPT and 3DPT, and was overcome at 6DPT, where no statistically significant differences between PEGtreated and non-treated plants were recorded (
Fig. 2i
). Following the initial stress response of plants to PEG treatment, which involves the reduction in 
cis,trans
-NL and DNL content, 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. argolica
ssp. 
argolica
</tp:taxon-name>
plants adapt to the stress conditions and compensate for the content of nepetalactones.
</p>
         <p>
As previously speculated, the accumulation of NL, and therefore its amount in plant tissues, is controlled by the balance between the rate of formation and the rate of loss, the latter being a consequence of a direct release into the environment and/or conversion into its derivatives, such is DNL (

). As a means to evaluate the efficiency of NL catabolism and its conversion into DNL, we calculated the DNL/ 
trans,cis
-NL or DNL/ 
cis,trans
-NL ratio in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. argolica
ssp. 
argolica
</tp:taxon-name>
, respectively (
Fig. 2e and j
). The results point out that DNL/ 
cis,trans
-NL ratio was significantly lower in PEG-treated 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. argolica
ssp. 
argolica
</tp:taxon-name>
plants at 1DPT than in non-treated plants, presumably due to a very reduced DNL content. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
, DNL
</tp:taxon-name>
/ 
trans,cis
-NL ratio was relatively constant throughout the 6 days of PEG-treatment. We presumed that the rate of 
trans,cis
-NL conversion into DNL was not influenced by PEG-treatment in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
plants, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>

showed changes in the production of oxygenated monoterpenes, which included a decrease in menthone and an increase in menthofuran amount (

<tp:taxon-name>
M. piperita

It is well known that GPPS is a heteromeric enzyme structured of a non-catalytic small subunit (SSU) and a large subunit (
LSU
) (

). The SSU of GPPS complex is considered to remodel the 
LSU
for the synthesis of C10-GPP, and is therefore responsible for controlling the production of volatile monoterpenes in mint (

). In our research, we selected to analyse the expression levels of a gene that corresponds to GPPS small subunit (
NrGPPS-SSU
and 
NaGPPS-SSU
). In both

         <p>
The reaction catalysed by GES is considered a key gatekeeping step in iridoid biosynthesis, since this enzyme is responsible for diverting metabolic flux away from canonical monoterpenes by converting GPP to geraniol, which is further transformed into iridoids (

). Both 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
showed a decreasing trend of the GES expression in response to PEG treatment. The expression of 
NrGES
in leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
was ~140-folds lower in PEG-treated plants compared to the respective non-treated plants at 6DPT (
Fig. 4a

<tp:taxon-name>

Expression patterns of 
8HGO
are similar to those of the other biosynthetic genes, showing significantly lower transcriptional levels in PEG-stressed plants already at 1DPT and steadily keeping them low throughout 6 days of the experiment (

<tp:taxon-name>
N. mussini

homologs found in the transcriptome database of 
<tp:taxon-name>

IS
2

(
NrIS2
and 

<tp:taxon-name>NaIS</tp:taxon-name>

) expression patterns were concomitant to the other structural genes and exhibited a decrease in PEG-stressed plants (

NrIS1
as the prominent candidate according to the sequence of the substrate recognition loop (

) and to the fact that its expression profile follows the pattern of nepetalactone changes during the development of 
<tp:taxon-name>

Lichman et al. (2019) have recently shown that NEPS enzymes of

are cyclases, capable of accepting 8-oxocytronellyl enol/enolate, the product of 
IS
, and cyclizing it to 
cis,trans

cis,cis
-nepetalactol (NmNEPS3). Oxidation of 
cis,trans
- nepetalactol into 
cis,trans
-NL and 
cis,cis
-nepetalactol into 
cis,cis
-NL goes via NmNEPS1. All functionally important residues of NmNEPS1 and NmNEPS3 were detected in NrNEPS1a and NrNEPS3 amino acid sequences, respectively. However, it was noticed that L156 and S198 of NmNEPS1 are substituted in NrNEPS1b with T157 and L198. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all NrNEPS candidates share a high level of amino acid identities with their 
<tp:taxon-name>

homologs and with 
<tp:taxon-name>

(−)- 
trans
-isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (ISPD) (Supplementary

and 
NrNEPS2
were the most abundant in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
leaves
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. S1e

trans,cis
-NL. The transcripts of 
NaNEPS1a
and 
NaNEPS1b
were not recorded in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. argolica
ssp.

</tp:taxon-name>
, species rich in 
cis,trans
-NL, while 
NaNEPS2
showed the highest levels of expression in this species in comparison with the other NEPSs (
Fig. S1f
). The candidates of NEPS genes were searched in available 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
transcriptome, and the same set of qPCR primers were used for the expression analysis of 
NrNEPS
s, as well as for 
NaNEPS
s. Although the two species are closely related, those primers might fail to amplify the corresponding 
NaNEPS1
sequences from 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. argolica
ssp. 
argolica
</tp:taxon-name>
. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
the expressions of 
NrNEPS1a
, 
NrNEPS1b
, and 
NrNEPS3
exhibited significant decreases in PEG-treated plants at 1DPT, 3DPT, and 6DPT (
Fig. 4a
). Although 
NrNEPS2
expression was reduced in response to PEG treatment, this reduction was significant only at 6DPT. Decreased expression of 
NaNEPS2
was observed in PEG-treated 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. argolica
ssp. 
argolica
</tp:taxon-name>
plants, while 
NaNEPS3
transcription levels were significantly increased in PEG-dehydrated plants (
Fig. 4b
). Our results indicate that all the analysed NEPS candidates, with the exception of 
NaNEPS3
, were involved in the modulation of nepetalactone biosynthesis in response to dehydration stress.
</p>
         <p>
It has been previously reported for many species that biosynthesis of specialized metabolites is modulated in response to water deficit conditions, by alterations at the gene expression level. Thus, 

have shown that the expressions of structural genes involved in artemisin biosynthesis decrease concomitant to the artemisin content in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Artemisia annua
</tp:taxon-name>
essential oil under prolonged water deficit stress. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Salvia dolomitica
</tp:taxon-name>
both moderate and severe drought stress conditions led to the modulation of the expression of some genes involved in sesquiterpene production, and to the increase of their content (

). The lower expression of NL biosynthetic genes under PEGinduced dehydration stress conditions implies a decrease in the metabolite flux through the NL biosynthetic pathway. This was partially supported by the metabolomics data, which revealed the decrease in 
cis,trans
-NL and DNL content in leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. argolica
ssp. 
argolica
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. 2h, i
). In 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
, this decrease was less pronounced and it was significant only at 1DPT for 
trans,cis
-NL and at 1DPT and 3DPT for DNL (
Fig. 2c, d
). Interestingly, at 6DPT the content of DNL in PEG-dehydrated 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. argolica
ssp. 
argolica
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis

plants was at the level of non-treated plants, which indicated that they probably adapted to the new stress conditions by enabling more intense conversion of NL to less volatile DNL.

We have presumed that NL biosynthesis is coordinated by jasmonate (JA)-signalling pathway, based on the well-established regulatory circuit of iridoid biosynthesis in 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
(

; 

). With the aim to discover sequences similar to TFs that are specifically controlling monoterpene biosynthesis in glandular trichomes of the related 
<tp:taxon-name>Lamiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
species BLAST search was performed. Sequences of three genes homologous to TFs putatively involved in JA-signaling (
COI1, JAZ3
and 
MYC2
) were identified in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
transcriptome, whereas no hits of sequences similar to ORCA and BIS group of TFs were found. Additionally, sequences highly similar to the ones encoding the regulators of monoterpene biosynthesis in spearmint – 
MsMYB
and 
MsYABBY5
(

, 

) have also been identified in the transcriptome of 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis

. The expression levels of 5 candidate TFs (
COI1

and

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. argolica
ssp.

</tp:taxon-name>
under PEG-induced dehydration conditions and further correlated with the expressions of NL biosynthetic pathway genes. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of these TFs was constructed to assign each of them to the correct clade and to show the evolutionary relationship with TFs from different species (
Fig. S3
). In addition, the specific domains of each of the analysed 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
candidate proteins were identified in the alignments with sequences of different species and their subclading with the sequences from species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Lamiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
could further support their identities (
Fig. S3
). The domains included F-box and Leu-rich repeats for NrCOI1, TIFY and Jas for NrJAZ3, JID and bHLH for NrMYC2, R2 and R3 repeats and bHLH motifs for NrMYB as well as Zinc finger and HMG-like YABBY domain for NrYABBY5.

in the dehydration stress conditions (

JAZ3
expression remained unchanged throughout the experiment in both non-treated and PEG-treated plants of both species (
Fig. 5a and b
). The unchanged expressions of 
COI1
and 

JAZ

in response to water scarcity could indicate that JA is either not a dominant part of the regulating network of nepetalactones biosynthesis during severe dehydration stress, or that JA-signalling cascade onsets in the early stages of the drought stress response, that were not analysed within this experiment. In confirmation of the latter hypothesis, a study by 

pointed out that the JA concentrations are fluctuating and seem to accumulate during the early stages of water stress. 

have shown that drought as a stress signal favours accumulation of ABA and JA precursor 12-OPDA, by uncoupling its further conversion to JA and blocking the JA-signalling. Although the expression of 
COI1
and 
JAZ3

MYC2
was significantly down-regulated under PEG-treatment throughout the whole experiment (
Fig. 5a and b

Nepeta

leaves during dehydration stress conditions. Unlike JAs, concentrations of abscisic acid (ABA), the major hormone controlling plant water loss, usually increases as tissue water status drops (

Fig. 5c and d
). Generally, positive correlations have been observed between the analysed biosynthetic genes, suggesting their co-ordinated regulation. Significant positive correlations between NL biosynthetic genes on the one hand, and 
YABBY5
and 
MYC2
TFs on the other, suggested their role as positive regulators of NL biosynthesis in leaves of both

2.5. Trichome-specific nepetalactone biosynthesis in 
<tp:taxon-name>N. rtanjensis leaves</tp:taxon-name>
         </p>
         <p>
We were further interested in analysing whether all the NL biosynthesis-related genes and selected TFs are expressed together in the same tissue-trichomes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
. The expression of 10 structural genes putatively involved in NL biosynthesis was analysed (
NrGPPS, NrGES, NrG8O, Nr8HGO, NrIS1, NrIS2 NrNEPS1.1, NrNEPS1.2, NrNEPS2
and 
NrNEPS3
) by comparing their transcript levels in detached trichomes and abraded leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
. The results revealed the significantly higher expression of all the analysed genes in detached trichomes in comparison with the abraded leaves (
Fig. 6a
), which indicated the trichome localization of the nepetalactone biosynthetic pathway from geraniol to NL. In our previous study, we have shown that the two IS candidates (
NrIS1
and 
NrIS2
) were differentially expressed in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
trichomes and abraded leaves, and that the spatial patterning of 
NrIS1
and 
NrIS2
expression is in correlation with the content of nepetalactones (

). Comparative proteome analysis of trichomes, trichome-depleted leaves and leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. mussinii
</tp:taxon-name>
, showed that all analysed proteins, including NmGPPS-SSU, NmGES, NmG8H, NmHGOA, NmHGOB, and NmISY2, were significantly trichome enriched (

).
</p>
         <p>
Similarly to the structural genes, the majority of TF genes exhibited significantly higher expression levels in detached trichomes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. rtanjensis
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. 6b
). Namely, 
NrCOI1, NrJAZ3, NrMYC2
and 
NrYABBY5
are predominantly expressed in leaf trichomes, which further supports the hypothesis about their involvement in trichome-specific metabolic processes. The trichome-localized expression and positive correlations between expression patterns of 
YABBY5
and 
MYC2
TFs and the majority of NL pathway structural genes during dehydration stress further implicates the relevance of these TFs to NL biosynthesis.

3. Concluding remarks
</title>
         <p>
As revealed by the presented results, the expression of NL-related biosynthetic genes and TFs is co-ordinately down-regulated in response to PEG-induced dehydration stress and was well correlated with metabolite pools, which suggests that NL biosynthesis is controlled at the gene expression level. This was less visible in the case of 

<tp:taxon-name>N. rtanjensis</tp:taxon-name>
,

where NL pools remained relatively stable throughout the dehydration experiment despite the decreased metabolic flux through the iridoid pathway. Taking into account that plants within the present study experienced severe stress, it would be interesting to see the changes during moderate and prolonged dehydration stress. Providing those data would be useful to improve the cultivation management and increase the productivity of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Nepeta
</tp:taxon-name>
crops in arid and semi-arid areas. Being the potential positive regulators of NL biosynthesis, trichome enriched NrMYC2 and NrYABBY5 TFs are highlighted as good candidates for metabolic engineering, and therefore their isolation and functional characterization are the course of our further work. Manipulation of such TFs can be more effective for engineering NL biosynthetic pathway rather than changing the expression of genes for individual enzymes involved. 
A
challenge for future studies will also be to identify other molecular players involved in the regulation of nepetalactone metabolism, which might act in a network with NrMYC2 and NrYABBY5 TFs, as well as to find their connections with phytohormones (e.g., 
JA
, 
ABA
) signalling networks. Growing knowledge on the NL metabolism regulation will aid in the development of new production techniques for increased yield of

NrNEPSs were aligned using Muscle software within the MEGA 6.0 software package. The default parameters of Gblocks v0.91b were utilized to trim divergent regions of the alignments and select blocks of alignment positions that are highly conserved. The phylogenetic analyses of the conserved blocks of the alignments were conducted by the maximum likelihood method using MEGA version 6.0 with the default settings (NNI heuristic method, BioNJ initial tree, JTT model and 1000 bootstrap replicates). For phylogenetic analysis of transcription factors, the evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. The percentages of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X. Multiple sequence alignments were generated using the ClustalW program. For a list of plant protein sequences used for phylogenetic analysis and their corresponding accession numbers refer to Table S2.
