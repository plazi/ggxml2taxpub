Ten previously undescribed cassane diterpenoids, cassabonducins A–J, and eleven known compounds were isolated from the seeds of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Caesalpinia bonduc
</tp:taxon-name>
. The structures of the undescribed compounds were elucidated by extensive analysis of spectroscopic data (IR, HRESIMS, and 
1
H, 
13
C and 2D NMR) and their absolute configurations were determined by the ECD data and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. 
ε
-Caesalpin-VII was obtained from natural resources for the first time. Cassabonducin A possessed noteworthy inhibitory activity against LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW 264.7 macrophages with IC 
50
value of 6.12 μM. Cassabonducin D and neocaesalpin N showed moderate 
α
-glucosidase inhibition at the concentration of 50 μM with inhibitory capacities of 47.17% and 43.83%, respectively.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Caesalpinia
</tp:taxon-name>
belongs to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family and comprises approximately 100 species that are commonly distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, including 20 species found in 
China
(

). Several 
<tp:taxon-name>
Caesalpinia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. sappan
</tp:taxon-name>
L., 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. bonduc
</tp:taxon-name>
(L.) Roxb., 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. minax
Hance
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. decapetala
(Roth) Alston
</tp:taxon-name>
are used in Chinese folk medicine for the treatment of anemopyretic cold, dysentery, swollen boils, bruises, and venomous snake bite (

; Editorial 

). Especially, 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. sappan
</tp:taxon-name>
L. (
<tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae</tp:taxon-name>
), known as a red dyestuff, is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat menorrhalgia, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases (

). Previous studies on the chemical constituents from the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Caesalpinia
</tp:taxon-name>
genus have led to the isolation of cassane diterpenoids, triterpenoids, steroids, flavonoids, lignans, phenylpropanoids, and alkaloids (

; 

). The cassane diterpenoids are mainly and characteristically chemical components of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Caesalpinia
</tp:taxon-name>
and have a wide range of biological activities bioactivities, including anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antimalarial, antiviral, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties (

).

            <tp:taxon-name>
Caesalpinia bonduc
</tp:taxon-name>
(L.) Roxb. (
<tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) is a stout prickly climber widely distributed in Southeast Asia and other tropical regions of the world (

). Its seeds have been used in Chinese folk medicine to treat common cold and dysentery (

), and also have the function of promoting blood circulation to arrest pain, and removing toxicity for detumescence (Editorial 

). In Indian, various parts of this plant are used to treat cough, fever, headache, and stomach problems (

). The extract of this plant has been proved to exhibit antitumor, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antidiabetic effects (

). Furthermore, a wide variety of cassane diterpenes have been isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. bonduc
</tp:taxon-name>
and have been reported to possess significant antiproliferative (

, 

), antimalarial (

), and anthelmintic (

) activities. In a continuing search for bioactive cassane-type diterpenoids from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Caesalpinia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
(

; 

), a 95% EtOH extract of the seeds of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. bonduc
</tp:taxon-name>
were investigated, which resulted in the isolation of previously undescribed ten diterpenoids, caesalbonducins A-J (
1–10
), as well as eleven known ones (
Fig. 1
). Herein, we describe the isolation, structural elucidation, and nitric oxide (NO) and 
α
-glucosidase inhibitory activities of the isolated compounds.

2.1. Structural elucidation
</title>
         <p>
A 95% EtOH extract of the air-dried seeds of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. bonduc
</tp:taxon-name>
was partitioned between H 
2
O and EtOAc. The EtOAc fraction was subjected to MCI gel, silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and semipreparative HPLC to afford ten previously undescribed cassane diterpenoids, cassabonducins A-J (
1–10
), as well as eleven known compounds (
11–21
). Compared with literature data, the known compounds were identified as 
ε
-caesalpin-VII (
11
) (

), 6-acetoxy-3-deacetoxycaesaldekarine (
12
) (

), caesalmin E (
13
) (

), caesalpinin K (
14
) (

), caesalpinin M (
15
) (

), bonducellpin B (
16
) (

), bonducellpin E (
17
) (

), neocaesalpin N (
18
) (

), caesalmin R (
19

), norcaesalpinin E (
20

), and 1-deacetoxy-1-oxocaesalmin C (

Cassabonducin A (
1
) was obtained as colorless crystals, whose molecular formula was established as C 
26
H 
32
O

by the pseudomolecular ion peak at 
m/z
511.1950 [M+Na] 
+
(calcd 511.1939) in HRESIMS spectrum, implying eleven degrees of unsaturation. The IR absorptions indicated the presence of hydroxy (
3439 cm
-1
), carbonyl (1781 and 
1747 cm
1
), and double bond (
1632 cm
1
) functionalities. The 
1
H NMR spectroscopic data (
Table 1
) displayed diagnostic signals of an exocyclic methylene [
δ
H
5.76 (d, 
J
= 2.0 Hz, H-17a) and 5.43 (d, 
J
= 2.0 Hz, H-17b)], two trisubstituted double bond [
δ
H
6.16 (t, 
J
=1.3, Hz, H-15) and 5.74 (t, 
J
=2.0, Hz, H-11)], three oxymethines [
δ
H
5.66 (t, 
J
=11.0 Hz, H-7), 5.62 (d, 
J
=11.0 Hz, H-6), and 5.09 (t, 
J
=3.2 Hz, H-1)], and three methyl groups [
δ
H
1.27 (s, H 
3
-20), 1.11 (s, H 
3
-18), and 1.10 (s, H 
3
-19)]. The 
13
C NMR and DEPT spectra exhibited 26 carbon signals (
Table 2
), categorized into three methyls, three methylenes (one olefinic carbon at 
δ
C
117.4), seven methines (two olefinic carbons at 
δ
C
111.8 and 108.5, and three oxygenated carbons at 
δ
C
76.5, 74.8, and 74.3), and seven nonprotonated carbons (one oxygenated carbon at 
δ
C
80.3, three olefinic carbons at 
δ
C
154.7, 152.4, 138.1, and one carbonyl at 
δ
C
171.6), and three acetyl groups (
δ
C
172.4 and 21.1; 172.1 and 21.7; 171.6 and 21.0). The aforementioned spectroscopic analysis suggested that 
1
was a cassane diterpenoid. The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectroscopic data of 
1
were similar to those of neocaesalpin AF (

). The notable discrepancy involved that the methyl moiety at C- 
14 in
neocaesalpin AF was replaced by an exocyclic double bond in 
1
, which was evidenced by key HMBC (
Fig. 2
) correlations of H-17a and H-17b with C-8 (
δC
45.4) and C-14 (
δC
154.7).

The relative configuration of 
1
was established by analysis of the ROESY data (
Fig. 3
) and coupling patterns of related protons. The ROESY cross-peaks of H-1/H 
3
-20, H-6/H 
3
-20, H-6/H-8, and H 
3
-19/H 
3
- 20 indicated they were co-facial and adopted the 
β
-orientations. The coupling constants of 
J
6, 7
(11.0 Hz) and 
J
8, 9
(11.0 Hz) suggested that H-7 and H-9 were 
α
-axially orientated. However, the ROESY spectrum couldn’ t provide sufficient information to assign the configuration of C-5. Fortunately, a colorless crystal of 
1
was obtained from MeOH, and the 
α
-orientation of 5-OH were determined by X-ray diffraction (Cu K 
α
) analysis (
Fig. 4
). It was noteworthy that a small Flack parameter 0.01 (6) in the final refinement permitted the determination of the absolute configurations of 
1
as 1 
S
,5 
R
,6 
S
,7 
R
,8 
S
,9 
S
, 10 
S
(

). Therefore, the structure of 
1
was elucidated as (1

R
,9 
S
, 10 
S
)-5-hydroxy-1,6,7-triacetoxycassa-11,13(15),14(17)-trien-16, 12-olide.

Cassabonducin B (
2
) was obtained as a colorless oil. The positive-ion HRESIMS data revealed an [M+Na] 
+
ion peak at 
m/z
497.2153 (calcd 497.2146), consistent with the molecular formula C 
26
H 
34
O 
8,
corresponding to ten degrees of unsaturation. Its IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands for hydroxy (3440 
cm-1
), conjugated carbonyl (
1747 cm
1
), and benzene ring (1627 and 
1480 cm
1
) groups. The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra of 
2
displayed the signals of one aromatic proton at 
δ
H
6.33 (b rs, H-11), six aromatic carbons at 
δ
C
158.2, 142.4, 133.0, 125.1, 124.3, and 102.2, and two aliphatic methylenes at 
δ
C
71.0 and 29.3 (
Tables 1
and 
2
), indicating the presence of a benzodihydrofuran ring in 
2
. The remaining 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data of 
2
displayed the signals of three acetyl groups [
δ
H
2.07 (s), 2.01 (s), and 1.99 (s); 
δ
C
169.8 and 21.0, 170.1 and 20.9, 169.7 and 21.3], four tertiary methyls, three aliphatic methylenes, three oxygenated methines [
δ
H
5.91 (d, 
J
= 3.1 Hz, H-1), 5.67 (t, 
J
=3.1 Hz, H-2), and 5.22 (d, 
J
=3.1 Hz, H-3); 
δ
C
77.2, 73.6, and 66.4], and three nonprotonated carbons (one oxygenated carbon at 
δ
C
75.8) (
Tables 1
and 
2
). The above analysis implied that compound 
2
was a benzodihydrofuran-type cassane diterpenoids with three acetoxy groups. The HMBC correlations from H-1, H-2, and H-3 to the carbonyls of 1-OAc (
δ
C
169.7 and 21.3), 2-OAc (
δ
C
170.1 and 20.9), and 3-OAc (
δ
C
169.8 and 21.0), respectively, along with the 
1
H– 
1
H COSY correlations of H-1/H-2/H-3 (
Fig. 2
), suggested the location of three acetoxy groups at C-1, C-2, and C-3. One hydroxy group attached to C-5 (
δ
C
75.8) in 
2
was deduced by the HMBC correlations from H 
2
-6 (
δ
H
2.02) and H 
3
-19 (
δ
H
1.27) to C-5. The ROESY correlations (
Fig. 3
) between H-1 and H 
3
- 20, H-2 and H 
3
-20, H-2 and H 
3
-19 indicated that H-1, H-2, H 
3
-19, and H 
3
-20 were 
β
-oriented. The 
α
-axial orientation of the 3-OAc was deduced by the small coupling constant of 
J
2,3
(3.1 Hz). Furthermore, the ROESY correlation of H 
3
-18 and 5-OH indicated that they were 
α
-oriented. Finally, the absolute configuration of compound 
2
was determined to be identical to 
11
by their similar experimental ECD curves and specific rotation values (
Fig. 5
). The planar structure and absolute configuration of 
11
was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis using Cu Kα radiation with a Flack parameter 0.03 (2) (
Fig. 4
). Thus, compound 
2
was established as (1

)- 1,2,3-triacetoxy-12, 16-epoxycassa-8,11,13-trien-5-ol. In addition, 
ε
-Caesalpin-VII (

ε

1
H and

11
were reported for the first time in the current study (

Cassabonducin C (

) was obtained as white amorphous powder, and was assigned the molecular formula C 
20
H 
26
O 
3
on the basis of an HRESIMS [M+Na] 
+
ion at 
m/z
337.1780 (calcd 337.1774). The absorptions in the IR spectrum appeared at 3441, 1732, and 
1638 cm
1
attributable to hydroxy, ester carbonyl, and double bond groups, respectively. The 
1
H-NMR spectrum of 
3
displayed signals corresponding to four tertiary methyls (
δ
H
2.38 s
, 
1.31 s
, 
1.14 s
, and 
1.12 s
), an oxygen-substituted methine (
δ
H
4.57, br s, H-1), an aromatic proton (
δ
H
7.39, br s, H-11), and a 1,2-disubstituted furan ring (
δ
H
7.54, d, 
J
=1.8, H-16 and 6.74, d, 
J
=1.8, H-15) (
Table 1
). The 
13
C-NMR spectrum of 
3
showed 22 carbon signals (
Table 2
) attributable to four methyls, four aliphatic methylenes, four methines (one oxygenated at 
δ
C
73.5, one aromatic at 
δ
C
104.5, and two olefinic at 
δ
C
144.4, 105.2), and eight nonprotonated carbons (one oxygenated at 
δ
C
77.2 and five aromatic at 
δ
C
153.9, 141.1, 129.3, 125.8, 104.5). The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectroscopic data for 
3
closely resembled those of caesalpinin MP (

), except for one hydroxy group at C-1 (
δ
C
73.5) in 
3
instead of the acetoxy unit in the latter. This assumption was verified by the correlations from H 
2
-2 (
δ
H
2.22 and 1.96) and H 
3
-20 (
δ
H
1.31) to C- 
1 in
the HMBC spectrum. The correlations of H-1/H 
3
-20, H-2 
β
/H 
3
-20, and H-2 
β
/H 
3
-19, and 5-OH/H 
3
-18 were observed in the ROESY spectrum, suggesting the 
β
-orientations of H-1, H 
3
-19, and H 
3
-20, whereas the 
α
-orientations of 5-OH and H 
3
-18. The absolute configuration of 
3
were established as 1 
S
, 5 
R
, 10 
S
based on the similar ECD absorption curves of 
3
and 
12
(
Fig. 5
). The structure and absolute configuration of 
12
was assigned by single-crystal X-ray diffraction in the current study (
Fig. 4
). Hence, the structure of 
3
was identified as (1 
S
,5 
R
,10 
S
)-12,16-epoxycassa-8,11,13,2,15-tetraen-1, 5-diol. In addition, the 
13
C NMR data (

12
was reported for the first time in this study.

Cassabonducin D (

H

O 
6
by the pseudomolecular ion peak at 
m/z
441.2260 [M+Na] 
+
(calcd 441.2248) in HRESIMS spectrum. The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra of 
4
(
Tables 1
and 
2
) showed a close resemblance to those of caesalpinin K (
14
) (

), with the only difference being the presence of an extra acetyl group (
δ
H
2.07 s
, 
δ
C
170.8 and 22.1.) in 
4
. The deshielded C-7 resonance (Δ 
δ
C
+54.8) indicated that the additional acetoxy group was located at C-7, which was further supported by the HMBC correlations (
Fig. 2
) between H-7 (
δ
H
5.38) and the acetyl carbonyl (
δ
C
170.8). The ROESY cross-peaks (
Fig. 3
) of H-7 and H 
3
-18 with OH-5, and of H-7 and H-9 with H 
3
-17 suggested that H-7 was 
α
-oriented. The absolute configuration of 
4
was subsequently determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (
Fig. 4
). Ultimately, the structure of 
4
was assigned as (1

Cassabonducin E (

6
as deduced from HRESIMS (
m/z
441.2243 [M+Na]

; calcd 441.2248) and 
13
C NMR data. Examination the 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectroscopic data (
Tables 1
and 
2
) revealed that the structure of 
5
was closely related to that of 
4
, except for a notable change involving that an acetoxy group at C- 
7 in
4
moved to C-6 (
δ
C
73.4) in 
5
. This prediction was proved through the HMBC correlations from H-6 (
δ
H
5.35) to the acetyl carbonyl (
δ
C
170.5), along with the 
1
H– 
1
H COSY correlations of H-6/H 
2
-7/H-8/H-9. H-6 was assigned as 
β
-oriented by the ROESY correlations of H-6 with H-8 and H 
3
-20. The relative configurations of remaining stereogenic centers of 
5
were found to be the same as those of 
4
by the ROESY data. The ECD spectrum of 
5
showed a positive Cotton effect at 
220 nm
(
Δε

4
(

Cassabonducin F (

H 
32
O 
7
on basis of HRESIMS data at 
m/z
455.2037 [M+Na] 
+
(calcd 455.2040), corresponding to nine degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum showed absorptions at 3571 and 
1736 cm
1
, which indicated the existence of hydroxy and carbonyl functionalities, respectively. The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectroscopic data (
Tables 1
and 
2
) of 
6
were almost identical to those of 
4
, with the only distinction being that 
6
possessed a formyl group at C-17 (
δ
C
199.9) instead of a methyl group in 
4
. This assertion was validated by HMBC correlations from H-17 (
δ
H
9.22) to C-14 (
δ
C
52.9) and from H-8 (
δ
H
2.27) and H-14 (
δ
H
3.21) to C-17. The ROESY correlations between H-1 and H 
3
-20, H-8 and H-17, H-8 and H 
3
-20 indicated that H-1, H-8, H 
3
-17, and H 
3
-20 were 
β
-oriented. Furthermore, the ROESY correlations of H-7/H-9, H-7/H-14, H-9/H-14, and H-9/5-OH indicated that they were 
α
-oriented. Colorless crystals of 
6
were obtained from MeOH. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis with Cu Kα radiation (
Fig. 4

6
unequivocally established its absolute configuration as 1 
S

S

Cassabonducin G (

H

O 
8
on the basis of an HRESIMS [M+Na] 
+
ion at 
m/z
471.1986 (calcd 471.1989), implying nine indices of hydrogen deficiency. IR spectrum showed absorption bands for hydroxy (
3436 cm
-1
) and carbonyl (1746 and 
1715 cm
1
) groups. The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra of 
7
(
Tables 2
and 
3
) displayed signals corresponding to 1,2-disubstituted furan ring (
δ
H
6.39 and 7.26, both d, 
J
=1.7 Hz; 
δ
C
142.1 and 108.8), two acetyl groups (
δ
H
2.05 s

1.96 s
; 
δ
C
21.9, 172.7 and 21.7, 172.1), four tertiary methyls, three aliphatic methylenes, four methines [cluding two oxymethines (
δ

5.59 br s and 5.78 br s; 
δ
C
77.1 and 75.0)], and four nonprotonated carbons [including two oxygenated ones (
δ
C
83.7, 69.5) and one ketone carbonyl (
δ
C
214.8)]. The aforementioned NMR data revealed that 
7
was also a cassane diterpenoid and was structurally similar to caesalmin D (

). Compared with caesalmin D, a ketone carbonyl rather than an oxymethine was located at C-1 for 
7
, which was confirmed by the HMBC correlations of H 
2
-2 (
δ
H
2.89 and 2.17) and H 
3
-20 (
δ
H
1.52) with C-1 (
δ
C
214.8). Because H-6 and H-7 were broad singlet, the related correlations could not be detected in ROESY spectrum. Fortunately, single crystals were obtained from MeOH. Through the single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis using Cu-K 
α
radiation with the Flack parameter 0.02 (3) unambiguously determined the absolute configuration as 5

Cassabonducin

H 
34
O 
7
was established by HRESIMS (
m/z
445.2199 [M+Na] 
+
, calcd 445.2197). The IR spectrum showed characteristic absorption bands of hydroxyl (3580 
cm-1
) and ester carbonyl (
1740 cm
1
). The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data (
Tables 2
and 
3
) were closely related to those of caesalpinin L (

), except that a hydroxy group at C- 
7 in
8
replaced the acetoxy moiety in caesalpinin L and that the methyl group of C- 
17 in
caesalpinin L was oxidized into a hydroxymethyl group in 
8
. In addition, the presence of one methoxy group (
δ
H
3.20 s
; 
δ
C
53.1) at C-14 (75.9) in 
8
was observed. These differences were confirmed by the HMBC correlations (
Fig. 2
) from H-7 (
δ
H
4.40) to C-6 (
δ
C
35.2) and C-8 (
δ
C

δ
C

to C-14. The ROESY correlations (
Fig. 3
) between H-1 and H 
3
-20, H-8 and H 
2
-17, H-8 and H 
3
-20 indicated these protons were 
β
-oriented. Furthermore, the ROESY correlations of OCH 
3
and H-7 with H-9, and of H-7 and H 
3
-18 with 5-OH indicated the 
α
-orientation. The experimental and calculated ECD spectra showed good agreement (

The molecular formula of cassabonducin I (

H

O

, on the basis of a pseudomolecular ion peak at

(calcd for C 
23
H 
32
O 
8
Na, 459.1989) in the HRESIMS spectrum, indicating eight degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum exhibited absorptions for hydroxy (3569 
cm-1
) and carbonyl (
1733 cm
1
) functionalities. Their 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data (
Tables 2
and 
3
) implied that 
9
possessed similar structure as that of caesalpinin M (
15
) (

). The only difference included one hydroxy group linked to C-7 (
δ
C
78.7) in 
9
instead of an acetoxy group in 
15
. This finding was performed by the presence of the HMBC correlations (
Fig. 2
) from H-7 (
δ
H
3.74) to C-6 (
δ
C
76.0) and C-8 (
δ
C

δ
H
5.28) and the acetyl carbonyl, as well as the upfield-shifted C-7 (Δ 
δ
C
+3.5) resonance. In ROESY spectrum (
Fig. 3
), the correlations of 5-OH/H-9, H-9/H-14, H-7/H-14, and 5-OH/H 
3
-18 indicated the 
α
-orientations of 5-OH, H-7, H-9, and H-14. In addition, the ROESY cross-peaks of H-1/H 
3
-20, H-8/H-6, H-6/H 
3
-19, and H-8/H 
3
-20 were in agreement with the 
β
-orientations of these protons. Finally, crystals suitable for X-ray crystallographic analyses were obtained from MeOH. The complete structure and absolute configuration were determined through the X-ray diffraction with Cu K 
α
radiation (
Fig. 4

9
was identified as methyl (1

Cassabonducin J (

O 
10
, as deduced from its HRESIMS data at 
m/z
517.2044 [M+Na]

(calcd 517.2050). Comparison of the 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectroscopic data (
Tables 2
and 
3
) of 
10
with those of 
9
indicated that they were structural analogs. The main differences were the interchanged hydroxy and acetoxy groups at C-1 and C-7, and the presence of one more acetoxy group at C- 
2 in
10
. HMBC correlation from H-7 (
δ
H
5.23) to the acetyl carbonyl (
δ
C
172.4) confirmed the position of one acetoxy group at C-7. However, the correlation from H-2 (
δ
H
5.28) to another acetyl carbonyl (
δ
C
170.2) was not observed in HMBC spectrum. Fortunately, the acetoxy group (
δ
H
2.11 s
; 
δ
C
21.5, 170.2) attached to C-2 was determined by the HMBC correlations from 1-OH (
δ
H
2.74), 5-OH (
δ
H
3.88), and 6-OH (
δ
H
2.11) to C-1 (
δ
C
74.0), C-5 (
δ
C
79.4), and C-6 (
δ
C
74.7), respectively. The location of one hydroxy group at C-1 (
δ
C
74.0) was further confirmed by the HMBC correlations from H-1 (
δ
H
3.81) to C-2 and C-10 (
δ
C
46.0), coupled with the 
1
H– 
1

2.2. LPS-induced NO inhibitory and α- glucosidase activity
</title>
         <p>
The extract of this plant has been proved to have anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic effects (

). In addition, some cassane diterpenoids have been reported to possess potent anti-inflammatory activity (

; 

, 

). So, compounds 
1–21
were evaluated for their nitric oxide (NO) production and α- glucosidase inhibitory activities. Compound 
1
was found to exhibit potent inhibitory activity against LPS-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages with IC 
50
value of 6.12 
μ
M, compared to 45.36 
μ
M of L-NMMA (
N
G-
Monomethyl-L-arginine). The other compounds were inactive (IC 
50
&gt;
50 μM). Compounds 
4
and 
17
exhibited moderate 
α
-glucosidase inhibition at 50 
μ
M with inhibitory rates of 47.17% and 43.83%, respectively, compared to the inhibitory rate of 58.71% for quercetin at 10 μM. The other compounds were inactive with inhibitory rate of lower than 30%.
</p>
         <p>
In the light of the structures and the anti-inflammatory activity, a preliminary structure activity relationship observation was made. The isolated cassane diterpenoids with benzodihydrofuran (
2
and 
11
), benzofuran (
3
and 
12
), furan (
4–10
, 
13–17
, 
20
, and 
21
), and butenolide lactone (
18
and 
19
) units were inactive (IC 
50
&gt;
50 μM). However, compound 
1
exhibited potent inhibitory effect against NO production. These observations suggested that the 
α
, 
β
-unsaturated 
γ
-lactone ring conjugated with an extra double bond between C-11 and C- 
12 in
1
was important for its anti-inflammatory activity.

4.1. General experimental procedures
</title>
         <p>
HRESIMS were performed on an Agilent 1290 UPLC/6540 Q-TOF spectrometer. UV spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2401A spectrophotometer. Optical rotations were measured with a Jasco P-1020 polarimeter. IR spectra were obtained by a Tensor 27 spectrophotometer with KBr pellets. ECD spectra were measured on a Chirascan Circular Dichroism Spectrometer.1D (
1
H, 
13
C, and DEPT) and 2D (
1
H– 
1
H COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and ROESY) spectra were recorded on an Avance III 500 and AV 600 MHz spectrometer. Semi-preparative HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1200 apparatus equipped with a diode array detector and a Zorbax SB-C-18 (Agilent, 
9.4 mm
× 
25 cm
) column. X-ray diffraction was performed on a Bruker APEX DUO diffractometer using graphitemonochromated Cu Kα radiation. MPLC was performed using a Lisui EZ Purifier III System (
Shanghai

Shanghai
, 
China
) coupled with UV detector. Column chromatography (CC) was performed using silica gel (100–200 and 200–300 mesh, Qingdao Marine Chemical Co. Ltd., Qingdao, 
China
) and MCI gel (CHP20P, 75–150 μm; Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, 
Japan
). Fractions were monitored by TLC (GF254, Qingdao Marine Chemical Co. Ltd., Qingdao,

4.3. Extraction and isolation
</title>
         <p>
The powdered air-dried seeds of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. bonduc
</tp:taxon-name>
(
10 kg
) were extracted with 95% EtOH (3 × 15 L, 48 h each) at room temperature. Removal of the extracted solvent under reduced pressure yielded a residue, which was suspended in H 
2
O and partitioned with EtOAc (4 × 2 L). The extract was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 
169 g
of residue, which was fractionated by MPLC (MCI gel), eluting with MeOH/H 
2
O (70:30, 75:25, 80:20, 85:15, 90:10, 95:5, 100:0, v/v, 30 mL/min), to provide five fractions (A-E).
</p>
         <p>
Fraction A (
13.5 g
) was separated by CC over silica gel eluting with a step gradient of (CHCl 
3
–MeOH, 100:1–7:3, v/v) to give three fractions (A1-A3). Subfraction A1 (
2.9 g
) was further purified by silica gel CC eluting with petroleum ether (PE)-acetone (7:3, v/v) and semipreparative HPLC (MeCN–H 
2
O, 54:46, v/v, 3 mL/min) to afford compounds 
12
(
4.4 mg
,

</p>
         <p>
Fraction B (
13.9 g
) was subjected to silica gel CC eluted with a PEacetone graent (30:1–6:4, v/v) to provide three subfractions (B1–B3). Subfraction B1 (
4.6 g
) was further subjected to silica gel CC (PE-EtOAc, 100:1–9:1, v/v) and further purified by Sephadex LH-20 CC (MeOH) to give 
15

16.5 min).
</p>
         <p>
Fraction C (
12.4 g
) was subjected to CC on silica gel eluting with a gradient of CHCl 
3
-acetone (100:0–1:1) to give 
17
(
7.5 mg
), 
18
(13.0 mg), and another two subfractions (C1–C2). Subfraction C1 (
2.3 g

10
(8.0 mg). Subfraction C2 (
3.1 g
) was further applied to a silica gel CC (PE-EtOAc, 50:1–8:2, v/v) and then purified by semipreparative HPLC (MeCN–H 
2
O, 48:52, v/v) to obtain

4.5. ECD computational methods
</title>
         <p>
The ECD calculations of 
8
were carried out using Gaussian 16 (

). The structure of 
8
was subjected to CONFLEX 8A (CONFLEX Corporation, 
Tokyo
, 
Japan
) software for conformational analysis and only one conformer accounting for 92.5% distribution was obtained. These initial structures were optimized via the Density Functional Theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6–31 +G(d) level in MeOH with PCM model. The optimized conformations were used for ECD calculations by the Time Dependent DFT (TDDFT) at the B3LYP/6–311++G (2d, p) level. The calculated ECD spectrum was generated by a SpecDis version 1.63 software (

An enzyme-inhibitor screening model was chosen using 4-nitrophenol-α- D-glucopyranoside (PNPG) and slightly modified (

). Briefly, test compound (50 
μ

C for 50 min. Absorbance at 
405 nm
was recorded on a microplate reader. Blank readings (no enzyme) were subtracted from each well, and the results were compared to the control. The quercetin was selected as the positive control. All the reactions were repeated three times. The inhibition rate (%) was calculated as (1- 
ODsample
)/ 
ODcontrol blank
× 100%.
