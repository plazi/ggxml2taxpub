Thymus longicaulis

</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Lamiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) is a small aromatic perennial herb typical of the Illyric-Mediterranean flora, traditionally used as remedy for cold, flu, cough, nephritis and abdominal pain. In order to carry out a thorough chemical and biological screening of the plant and to explore phenophases influence on its polyphenol content, samples of the plant were collected at different phases during its life cycle (July/ 
October 2012
and January/ 
April 2013
). Each sample, previously extracted using a hydroalcoholic solution, was phytochemically analyzed for its metabolic constitution applying LC-DAD-ESI-MS/ 
MS
techniques. Although identified metabolites were differently concentrated at the various collection times, 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. longicaulis
</tp:taxon-name>
leaf extracts were mainly constituted by low molecular weight phenols, and flavonoids. Rosmarinic acid was found as the main metabolite in Oct12 sample. Chemopreventive efficacy of the investigated extracts, by means of their anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic and antioxidant activities, was assessed. To this purpose, each extract underwent an extensive screening towards five human cell lines: 
CCRF-CEM
(leukemia); 
U
251 (glioblastoma); MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer); HCT-116 (colon cancer) and MRC-5 (lung fibroblasts) through XTT [2,3bis(2-metoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2 
H
tetrazolium hydroxide] test. The ability of the extracts to counteract cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression was also evaluated by COX-2 expression assay in human THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages. COX-2 inhibition could represent a valuable anticancer strategy as it is associated with carcinogenesis and over-expressed in a variety of human malignancies. Oct12 extract, which was particularly rich in rosmarinic acid and methylapigenin, exhibited a strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effectiveness.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Over the last few decades, a huge resurgence in the interest and use of medicinal aromatic plant products has been witnessed (

; 

). Several plant-based compounds are recognized to play important preventive role against some chronic and degenerative diseases (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders) and new scientific evidence is available demonstrating wide range of pharmacological and nutraceutical activities of plant natural products as pure molecules or herbal extracts (

; 

; 

). These include antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities.
</p>
         <p>
Although aromatic plants are used since ancient times for their essential oils content (

), they produce a large
</p>
         <p>
amount of other secondary metabolites (e.g. phenol compounds), which play a major role in their adaptation to the changing environment and in overcoming stress constraints (

). These substances are able to exert beneficial effects for human well-being and their identification represents an interesting research field for the optimization of safe formulations rich in bioactive ingredients of the vast number of medicinal plants used in Mediterranean area, the wild growing species 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thymus longicaulis
C. Presl.
</tp:taxon-name>
has received considerable interest. This plant, belonging to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Lamiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family, typical representative of the Illyric-Mediterranean flora, has been extensively investigated for the composition and/or biological properties of its essential oils (

; 

). Genetic, physiological and environmental factors as well as processing conditions may play an important role while defining the chemistry and chemical composition of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. longicaulis
</tp:taxon-name>
essential oils (

). GC and GC– 
MS
analysis of the essential oil resulted in determination twenty-two different compounds, representing 99.61% of total oil (

): Ƴ- erpinene, thymol and 
p
-cymene were determined as the major compounds of the oil (27.80%, 27.65% and 19.38%, respectively). Recently, Vladimir-Knežević et al., (2012) evaluated the composition of an antimicrobial 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. longicaulis
</tp:taxon-name>
essential oil from 
Croatia
: a total of forty-one compounds (99%) were identified and thymol (46.3%) was the main component. Essential oil of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. longicaulis
</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Kosovo
resulted with a quantitative and qualitative variation of constituents (

).
</p>
         <p>
Since no earlier reports are available regarding the detailed chemical characterization of its phenol constituents, and the variation in the phenol profile of the plant collected during different seasons, 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. longicaulis
</tp:taxon-name>
hydroalcoholic extracts were prepared through ultrasound-assisted maceration from aerial parts of the plant collected during its different ontogenic growth stages (
July and October 2012
, and 
January and April 2013
). As the complexity of the herbal extracts is a real challenge for determining their reliable and accurate compositional data, LC– 
MS
techniques were applied. The combination of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry has been proven to be an efficient method for the characterization of plant complexes as it allows rapid and reliable identification of semi-polar and polar plant components (

; 

; 

). The potential chemopreventive efficacy of the investigated extracts in terms of their antioxidant, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory activities were also assessed through an extensive biological screening.

2. Results and discussion
</title>
         <p>In recent years, epidemiological evidence have emphasized the close relationship between specific plant compounds with bioactive properties and human health. Medicinal plants, especially those with ability to counteract the free radicals overproduction, are considered to be an effective weapon in the prevention of various diseases related to oxidative stress, improving overall well-being.</p>
         <p>
In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic and antioxidant properties of extracts from 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. longicaulis
</tp:taxon-name>
prepared after harvesting of the plant at different stages of its life cycle. Since the phytochemical composition of a plant is heavily dependent on its growth conditions and environmental factors such as light, temperature, water availability (which leads to drought influence) can strongly modulate the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in the plant, it is necessary to fully characterize the composition (and seasonal fluctuations thereof) of plants with wide medicinal use. It was widely observed that phenolics have their biosynthesis and bioactivity affected by 
UV
(

). In particular, it is well documented that the accumulation of flavonoids, which confer 
UV
protection to plant tissues, is due to UV-exposure. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cistus
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
, for instance, can have the contents of flavonoids in its leaf exudates enhanced by 
UV
radiation induction, or by drought, and even by a positive synergic regulation of both factors on synthesis (

). Thus, the different response of a plant to its environment may result in a variable presence of natural products to which human can draw on to benefit even if the collection time does not match the balsamic period of the medicinal species.

In order to identify changes in the metabolic profile in wild plants of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. longicaulis
,
</tp:taxon-name>
LC–ESI-MS/MS analyses of hydroalcoholic extracts (Jul12, Oct12, Jan13, Apr13), prepared by the maceration accelerated with ultrasound of leaf samples of herbaceous species collected at different stages of its life cycle, were carried out. The maceration in H 
2
O:MeOH (1:1, v:v) facilitated the preparation of extracts in which polyphenols are abundant. Polyphenols are molecules highly biosynthesized in plants in which exercise primarily a defensive role against the overproduction of reactive oxygen species induced by abiotic stresses (
Gholizadeh and Kohnehrouz, 2010
). The metabolites identified are reported in 

and 
Table 1
.
</p>
            <p>
Compound 
1
, was identified based on its fragmentation pattern, as quinic acid. In fact, the MS 
2
spectrum of the [M 
—
H] 

—

ion at 
m/z
191 showed the ion at 
m/z
173, resulting from the dehydration of the deprotonated molecular ion and the fragment ions at 
m/z
127 and 111 (
Oen, 1985
).
</p>
            <p>
Compound 
2
, eluted with a retention time of 1.52 min, was putatively identified as stachyose (Galoi1–6Galoi1–6Glcoi1–2Fru). The mass spectrum showed a peak at 
m/z
701, due to the adduct with chloride, [M+Cl] 

—

, whose fragmentation generated the deprotonated molecular ion at 
m/z
665 and a chlorinated adduct at 
m/z
539 formed by neutral loss of a fructose residue (162 Da) from the corresponding precursor [M+Cl] 

—

(
Guan and Cole, 2008
).
</p>
            <p>
The metabolite 
3
, identified in the samples from July (Jul12), January (Jan13) and April (Apr13), was putatively identified as 12-hydroxyjasmonic acid hexoside (tuberonic acid), a molecule previously isolated from the leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Origanum vulgare
</tp:taxon-name>
and other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Thymus
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Koukoulitsa et al., 2006
; 
Pereira et al., 2013
). The mass spectrum showed the [M–H] 

—

ion at 
m/z
387 which provided the ion at 
m/z
207 as base peak. This latter, due to CO 
2
loss, generated the ion at 
m/z
163.
</p>
            <p>
MS 
n
spectra of compound 
4
were in accordance with the presence of a 
bis -C
-glycosylated flavone. The MS spectrum exhibited the deprotonated molecule at 
m/z
593, which produced MS 
2
ions at 
m/z
473 [M–H-120] 

—

(base peak; 
Han et al., 2008
) and 
m/z
341 and 311. The loss of 120 Da allowed us to hypothesize the presence of a hexose residue linked by C-C bond to apigenin (341 = [aglycone+71] 

—

; 311 [aglycone+41] 

—

). Further collision of the ion at 
m/z
473 yielded 
m/z
353 (loss of 120 Da) indicating the presence of a second 
C
-hexosyl moiety. The fragment ion at 
m/z
383 [aglycone+113] allowed us to confirm the aglycone identity (
Ferreres et al., 2003
). As 
C
-linked saccharide residues were found only in the C-6 and/or C-8 positions of flavone skeletons, compound 
4
was assigned as apigenin-6,8-di- 
C
-hexoside.
</p>
            <p>
The mass spectrum of the metabolite 
5
is in agreement with the presence of pinoresinol dihexoside (
Eyles et al., 2007
). The fragmentation of the deprotonated molecular ion [M–H] 

—

at 
m/z
681 led to the formation of fragment ions at 
m/z
519 and 357 for subsequent loss of two hexose residues (162 Da).
</p>
            <p>
Compound 
6
showed the [M–H] 

—

ion at 
m/z
693. Typical neutral losses of hexose moieties bound to a phenolic oxygen atoms as 162 Da (
Ricci et al., 2010
) provided MS 
2
fragment ions at 
m/z
521 and 359. This latter provided, besides others, the fragment ion at 
m/z
329 according to the loss of 30 Da, reasonably 
CH
2
O. These findings, in line with 
Ricci and Piccolella (2012)
which investigated the fragmentation mechanisms of furofuranic (FUR) and tetrahydrofuranic (THF) lignans, were in accordance with lariciresinol dihexoside.
</p>
            <p>
Compounds 
8
and 
12
were putatively identified on the basis of their fragmentation pattern and relative retention times, as rosmarinic acid (
12
) and its hexosyl (
8
) derivative. The mass spectrum of the metabolite 
12
showed the [M–H] 

—

ion at 
m/z
359. The MS 
2
spectrum of the precursor ion showed fragment ions at 
m/z
223 (due to the loss of a 3,4-dihydroxy vinylbenzene), 
m/z
197, corresponding to oi- hydroxyhydrocaffeoyl moiety, and at 
m/z
179 [caffeic acid-H] 

—

. The fragmentation of the ion at 
m/z
197 generated, in the MS 
3
experiment, a fragment ion [M–H] 

—

at 
m/z
521 provided for the compound 
8
the ion at 
m/z
359 (rosmarinic acid), leaving to assume the presence of a hexosyl derivative of the metabolite 
12
. The glycosylation could take place on of the aromatic unit of the oi- hydroxyhydrocaffeoyl moiety since it was recently observed that the bond of the hexose to the caffeic moiety provides a fragment at 
m/z
341 (
Sakalem et al., 2012
), which was not detected in our analyses. Recently Vallverdú-Queralt et al., (2014), evaluating the phytochemical composition of herbaceous species with broad culinary uses such as rosemary, oregano, thyme and bay leaf, showed the presence of the hexosyl derivative of rosmarinic acid only in rosemary and oregano.

The glycosylated flavonoids constitute the majority of polyphenols in spices. Glycosylated flavonoids were commonly observed. The UV spectrum, which showed two absorption bands at 284 and 
343 nm
, relating to the conjugations in the B and A rings of a flavonoid nucleus, together with the MS/MS data allowed the identification of the metabolite 
7
as quercetin-3- 
O
-hexoside. The deprotonated molecular ion, [M–H] 

—

, at 
m/z
463 dissociated generating the fragment ion at 
m/z
301 as base peak (
—
162 Da) (
Hossain et al., 2010
). The presence of the molecule is widely reported as constituent of species belonging to the Labiatae family (
Vallverdú-Queralt et al., 2014
).

            <p>
The mass spectra of the metabolites

were in agreement with the presence of glycosylated derivatives of flavone luteolin.

            <p>
The MS

spectrum of metabolite 
9
([M–H]

at

m/z
285 in
agreement with the presence of a hexosyl derivative of the flavone luteolin, identified on the basis of the MS 
3
fragmentation pattern. The molecule has recently been reported as a component of 

<tp:taxon-name>Thymus</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>
citriodorus
(

was putatively identified as luteolin-7-

</tp:taxon-name>
and

T. sipyleus
(

</tp:taxon-name>
. The [M–H] 

—

ion at 
m/z
461 provided the ion at 
m/z
285 by loss of 176 Da.
</p>
            <p>
The mass spectrum of the metabolite 
11
was in accordance with the presence of a disaccharide derivative of luteolin. In fact, the collision of the deprotonated molecular ion at 
m/z
579 gave fragment ions at 
m/z
417 and 285. The neutral loss of 162 Da suggested the presence of a hexose residue linked to a pentosyl derivative of luteolin, which for subsequent loss of 132 Da gave the flavone aglycone.
</p>
            <p>
Compound 
13
([M–H] 

—

at 
m/z
417) was putatively identified as pentosyl luteolin. The fragmentation of the [M–H] 

—

ion gave the ion at 
m/z
285 for the loss of a neutral residue of 132 Da (pentose). The collision of the ion at 
m/z
285 gave, also in this case, several typical luteolin fragment ions (
Gouveia and Castilho, 2013
) at 
m/ z
199 ([M 
—
H–C 
3

), 175 ([M

—

) and 241 ([M 
—
H–CO 
2
] 

—

). Since the 
O
-glycosylation of flavones is favored at C-7 (
Cuyckens and Claeys, 2004
), in the derivatives of luteolin identified the saccharide residue was tentatively positioned at C-7 carbon.
</p>
            <p>
The fragmentation of the [M–H] 

—

ion at 
m/z
591 provided for the compound 
15
the fragment ion at 
m/z
531. The neutral loss of 60 Da suggested the presence of an acetyl function linked to an alcohol one. Confirming this hypothesis, the collision of the ion at 
m/z
531 provided, among other ions, the fragment ion at 
m/z
399 [531–132]. The loss of an acetyl function esterified to an alcohol group of a pentose sugar could facilitate the conversion of the pentose sugar in 2H-dihydro- 
γ
-pyran with formation of the ion at 
m/z
513. The loss of the 2H-dihydro- 
γ
-pyran moiety generated the ion at 
m/z
399. The presence of the ion at 
m/z
417 suggested, once again, the presence of a pentosyl derivative of luteolin. From these observations the metabolite 
15
was identified as luteolin-7- 
O
-acetylpentosylpentoside.
</p>
            <p>
Compounds 
14
and 
19
were identified as two isomers of salvianolic K acid (
Lu and Foo, 2001
). The MS spectrum of both compounds showed the [M–H] 

—

ion at 
m/z
555, which, for subsequent decarboxylation and dehydration gave an ion at 
m/z
493. The loss of a 3,4-dihydroxyvinylbenzenic moiety generated the ion at 
m/z
359, which consisted in rosmarinic acid.
</p>
            <p>
The deprotonated molecular ion, [M–H] 

—

, at 
m/z
283 relative to the metabolite 
16
, isolated only in sample Oct12, has been identified as 4 

0

-metil-apigenin (acacetin). To confirm the UV spectrum showed two bands at 231 and 
330 nm
and the spectrum MS/MS provided an abundant fragment at 
m/z
268 probably formed by homolytic cleavage and loss of 
CH
•
3
(
Hossain et al., 2010
).
</p>
            <p>
Compound 
17
, present only in Jul12 sample, was putatively identified as a hydroxycinnamyl derivative: (oi- hydroxyhydroferuloylcaffeoyl)caffeoyl hexoside. The [M–H] 

—

ion at 
m/z
697 gave fragment ions at 
m/z
535 and 323. The loss of a residue of 162 suggested the presence of a caffeoyl residue probably esterified to a oi- hydroxyhydroferuloyl moiety. The electron delocalisation from the fragment at 
m/z
535 could lead to the loss of a 2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) acetaldehyde, a CO 
2
unit and of one water molecule favoring the formation of the ion at 
m/z
323, which for cross-ring cleavage of the saccharide moiety, generated the ion at 
m/z

2.2. Quantitative analysis of 
<tp:taxon-name>T. longicaulis</tp:taxon-name>
extracts

</p>
            <p>
The quantitative analysis allowed us to detect changes of the metabolic composition of the extracts from 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. longicaulis
</tp:taxon-name>
collected in the different four months (

). The luteolin derivatives (
O
- pentoside, 
O
-hexuronide and 
O
-acetylpentosylpentoside) and rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid K and isosalvianolic acid A were determined in all the samples analyzed. The concentration of such molecules seems to be collection time and season dependent. In fact, comparing the data obtained from the four samples, it was particularly observed that an increase in the content of rosmarinic acid and its derivatives was often related to a decrease of the content of the luteolin pentosyl derivatives. Rosmarinic acid was considerably abundant in the sample Oct12: it amounted to 
3.03 mg
quercetin equivalent for 1.0 g of fresh weight sample (
Table 2
). Jul12 sample contained the lowest amount of rosmarinic acid.

2.3. Antioxidant activity of extracts 
<tp:taxon-name>T. longicaulis</tp:taxon-name>
            </p>
            <p>
The evaluation of the antioxidant capacity was carried out by using different methods given the current state of non-existence of a valid method for the determination of total antioxidant capacity of a system. One of the methods used, since the antioxidant activity of plant extracts often is related to their polyphenols amount, was the method of Folin and Ciocalteu Reagent. Although the results obtained by this method cannot be considered an absolute measure of the amount of phenolic material constituting the plant drug, they provide an indication of the reducing properties of the plant matrix. By interpolation on a calibration curve of gallic acid, it was possible to estimate the effective reducing capacity of the four 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. longicaulis
</tp:taxon-name>
hydroalcoholic extracts. It was determined that the total polyphenol content (TPC) value was clearly higher in Jul12 extract (115.7 GAE (mg)/g FW) than in the other collected extracts. The TPC value undergoes profound changes that seem to strongly depend on the collection time. In fact, comparing the data of Jul12 sample with those for remaining months, it emerged that the TPC value was reduced for more than half for the Oct12 extract (69.6 GAE (mg)/g FW) and reached its lowest level for Jan13 extract (54.4 GAE (mg)/g FW). The spring season (Apr13) seemed to favor a plant metabolic activity turned to polyphenolic compounds biosynthesis (62.9 GAE (mg)/g FW).

As it is clear from 
Table 3
, all the investigated extracts showed an effective reducing power of the radical species target ABTS 

•
+

and DPPH 

•

. The scavenging effectiveness seemed to be strongly dependent on the tested dose. Oct12 extract, whose polyphenolic profile analysis highlighted the massive presence of rosmarinic acid, showed an effective reducing power of the radical species target ABTS 

•
+

and DPPH 

•

, quantifiable in the respective ID 
50
values (8.91 µg/mL 
vs
. the ABTS radical cation and 9.50 µg/mL 
vs
. DPPH radical). The scavenging effectiveness seemed to be strongly dependent on the tested dose: both the radicals were completely converted in their reduced form at 25.0 µg/mL dose. Rosmarinic acid antioxidant effectiveness was already reported; Fadel et al., (2011) showed that the antiradical activity of rosmarinic acid was much higher than that exerted by bioflavonoids. DFT studies revealed that the high antioxidant power of the molecule could be due to the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the ortho hydroxyl groups, characterizing both its A and B rings (
Cao et al., 2005
). The sample Oct12 is the only one that contained as constituent acacetin, a well known antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer natural substance, recently proposed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders (
Lin et al., 2014
). The evaluation of the Fe 
3+
reducing power strongly correlated with the TPC values (
Table 3
). In fact, it was observed that Jul12 contained the highest TEAC value (474.95 µg Trolox 

®

Equivalents per g of extract), followed by Oct12 sample (323.24 µg Trolox 

®

Equivalents per g of extract).

radicals at the highest doses tested and no fluorescein decay could be observed. Thus ORAC values were determined by calculating the net area under the curve (AUC) of the samples at the lowest tested dose (0.781 µg/mL). Oct12 was able to exert the strongest antiradical efficacy (776.54 µM Trolox 

®

Equivalents). The activity of Oct12 sample was about 1.48, 1.49, and 1.87-fold that of Jul12, Jan13, and Apr13 extracts, respectively.
</p>
            <p>
Data from ABTS, DPPH, ORAC, Fe 
3+
RP, and TPC assays were used to calculate RACI (Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index) value for each extract. RACI index allows the comparison of phytocomplexes antioxidant capacity derived from different chemical methods and provides a more comprehensive assessment of the whole antioxidant capacity. The ranking of antioxidant capacity of investigated extracts differed between methods. In particular, it was observed that ABTS and DPPH data had significant correlation (
Table 4
). RACI values highlighted that the four extracts were able to exert a similar antioxidant capability. Jul12 sample was slightly more active than the other ones (
Table 5
).

2.4. Cytotoxicity of extracts from 
<tp:taxon-name>T. longicaulis</tp:taxon-name>
            </p>
            <p>
The evaluation of cytotoxicity was carried out by application of the XTT test that allows to estimate the number of metabolically active cells present in culture and then to evaluate the effect of treatment with an exogenously added agent on the viability of the cell population (
Roehm et al., 1991
).
</p>
            <p>The test is based on the ability of the compound XTT tetrazolium (yellow colored) to be metabolized by the mitochondrial dehydrogenases, active in living cells, in a water-soluble formazan derivative of (bright orange colored). The viable cells, unlike those of non-viable, reduce XTT and the amount of formazan product is proportional to the number of present cells.</p>
            <p>
In order to obtain a cytotoxic profile of the investigated extracts and to fit out non toxic and safe preparations, each extract was tested in a wide dose level range (10–250 µg/mL; 

). Jul12, Oct12, Jan13 and Apr13 extracts showed dissimilar behaviors towards the different cell lines (HCT-116, MDA-MB-231, U-251, CCRF-CEM and MRC-5). In HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells Jul12 extract at the highest doses (50.0, 100.0 and 250.0 µg/mL) elicited a potent cytotoxic response after 48 and 72 h exposure times. The same extract defined a decrease of cell viability of MDA-MB-23 breast cancer cells, at a dose of 250 µg/mL. All the extracts did not affect the growth of U251 glioblastoma cells, while they exercised proliferative effects on CCRF-CEM lymphoblastic cells. Jul12 and Jan13 extracts exerted antiproliferative effects at the highest dose level tested even on MRC-5 cells, suggesting the potential cytotoxicity of both these extracts. Furthermore, the evidenced cytotoxic effects were due to an extract dose far higher than those chosen for testing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capabilities.

            <p>
Wild plants of 
<tp:taxon-name>
T. longicaulis
</tp:taxon-name>
were collected in Durazzano, a small center in the Southern 
Italy
(altitude 
286 m
above sea level) characterized by a mild Mediterranean climate, identified as Csa climate on the basis of Köppen and Geiger classification. Four collection times, between 2012 and 2013 years, were considered, each of them represented the first month of season. Data from ISPRA (Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale) reports show that 2012, as well as 2013, was a year warmer than the climatological mean, both globally and in 
Italy
(
Desiato et al., 2013
, 
2014
). The summer of 2012 was characterized by a strong lack of rainfall and strong positive thermal anomalies that have made it one of the hottest summers of the last fifty years. In the first July decade the average temperature in Durazzano was equal to 25.5 
°
C
with an average relative humidity of 59.4%. On 10th July the maximum temperature was 34.8 
°
C
. The drought condition and the absence of precipitations define a strong decrease of rosmarinic acid amount. The content of the other compounds, among those identified, was also negatively affected, with the exception of metabolites 
6
and 
17
, present only in the summer sample, and of compound 
13
which was 3.19, 1.73 and 1.41-fold that of Oct12, Jan13, and Apr13 extracts, respectively. The deleterious effect of heat stress on rosmarinic acid accumulation was previously reported by 
Fletcher et al. (2005)
, who hypothesize that the decrease of rosmarinic acid levels during continuous heat stress conditions could be due to a competing reaction. In fact the high demand for prenylquinones biosynthesis in plant tissues under stress conditions, reduces the availability of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (common precursor) for rosmarinic acid production. The long drought period characterizing the summer of 2012 ended on September and in 
October 2012
, our second collection time, typically autumnal conditions were present. The temperatures were slightly above the normal with a monthly average of 16.7 
°
C
, and rainfall was in line with the normal values (
170 mm
in 24 h). These environmental conditions, together with an average relative humidity equal to 76.2%, promoted a rosmarinic acid overproduction. Isosalvianolic acid 
A
were also abundantly present, whereas methylapigenin was for the first time identified. It was evident that Oct12 extract lacks a good portion of flavonoid glycosides component. This latter was again present in Jan13 sample and underwent a further increase in Apr13 sample. In the first half of 
January 2013
, the permanence of a high pressure area brought relatively mild temperatures over a large part of the Italian regions. In collection area the monthly average in terms of temperature, relative humidity and rainfall were 7.6 
°
C
, 77.3%, and 
6.4 mm
. Although the advent of the spring season was marked by low temperatures, mild climatic conditions characterized the 
April 2013
month with average temperature and rainfall of 15.0 
°
C
and 
2.5 mm
. On 10th April average temperature and relative humidity equal to 13.7 
°
C
and 70.0% were recorded. Common factors affecting the presence of flavonoid glycosides were the low precipitation rate and the high drought conditions that characterized the different considered collection times. Considering climate data, it is clear that Oct12 was a positive exception. Abiotic stresses resulting from water deficit led to reduction in photosynthesis, transpiration and other biochemical processes associated with plant growth and development (
Ramakrishna and Ravishankar, 2011
). Furthermore abiotic stress leads to oxidative stress which was counteracted by the biosynthesis of phenol compounds (
Nascimento and Fett-Neto, 2010
).

n
based metabolic profiling analyses showed marked qualitative and quantitative variations in the plant phytochemical constitution during its life cycle. Plants collected in July showed radical scavenging activity comparable to that exerted from autumnal extract, which consisted almost exclusively of rosmarinic acid. Jul12 extract was capable of exerting cytotoxic effects on colon and breast cancer cell lines comparable to or higher than those observed for vinblastine, a known anti-cancer agent. Oct12 extract, which was particularly rich in rosmarinic acid and methylapigenin, showed a marked antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential.
</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the study shows that the effectiveness of a plant can go far beyond its balsamic period reaching optimal values in a period in which the organism in order to cope with unfavorable environmental conditions (e.g. high temperature, dryness of the soil) activates secondary metabolic pathways useful for the biosynthesis of polyphenolic antioxidants.</p>

4.4. Scavenging capacity assessment

As multiple reaction characteristics and mechanisms as well as different phase localizations are usually involved, no single assay accurately reflect all of the radical sources or all antioxidants in a mixed or complex system. Thus, four different 
in vitro
antiradical assays were employed (

; 

). Each extract, previously dissolved in DMSO as stock solutions of 125.0 mg/mL, were evaluated at different levels (DMSO final concentration was equal to 0.1% (v:v)). Tests were carried out performing three replicate measurements for three samples (
n
= 3) of each extract (in total, 3 
×
3 measurements). Recorded activities were compared to a blank arranged in parallel to the samples.

4.4.4. Determination of oxygen radical absorbance capacity (
ORAC
)

</p>
         <p>
The 
ORAC
assay was performed as follows: each extract (20 µL; 0.781, 1.562, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5 and 25.0 µg/mL, final concentration levels) and fluorescein (120.0 µL; 70 nM, final concentration) were preincubated for 15 min at 37 
°
C
in 75 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Then 2,2 

0

-azobis-(2-amidinopropane)-dihydrochloride (AAPH) solution (60.0 µL; 36 mM, final concentration) was rapidly added. In parallel with the test samples, a blank (FL+AAPH) and solutions of the reference antioxidant Trolox 

®

(1–4 µM, final concentration levels) were properly prepared in PBS. The fluorescence decay (
λ
ex
= 
485 nm
, 
λ
em
= 
525 nm
) was recorded every minute for 120 min using a Tecan SpectraFluor fluorescence and absorbance reader. Antioxidant curves (fluorescence 
vs
. time) were normalized to the curve of the blank. From the normalized curves, the area under the fluorescence decay curve (AUC) was calculated. Linear regression equations between net AUC (AUCantioxidant – AUCblank) and antioxidant concentration were calculated for all the samples. The antioxidant activity (
ORAC
value) was calculated by using the Trolox 

®

calibration curve. The 
ORAC
values were expressed as Trolox 

®

equivalents (µM).

4.4.5. Determination of relative antioxidant activity index (
RACI
)

</p>
         <p>
As the units and the scale of the data from various chemical methods are different, the data in each data set should be transformed into standard scores, a dimensionless quantity derived by subtracting the mean from the raw data divided by the standard deviation, according to the equation standard score = (
x — µ
)/ 

Ơ

(

; 

), where 
x
represents the raw data, 
µ
the mean, and 

Ơ

the standard deviation. The standard scores of a sample for different assays when averaged give a single unitless value termed as 
RACI
, which is a specific combination of data from different chemical methods with no unit limitation and no variance among methods.
