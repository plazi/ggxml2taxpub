Changes in specialized metabolites were analyzed in wheat leaves inoculated with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bipolaris sorokiniana
</tp:taxon-name>
, the causal agent of spot blotch of 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
species. HPLC analysis detected the accumulation of six compounds in 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. sorokiniana
</tp:taxon-name>
-infected leaves. Of these, we purified two compounds by silica gel and ODS column chromatography and preparative HPLC, and identified them as cinnamic acid amides, 
N
-cinnamoyl-9-hydroxy-8-oxotryptamine and 
N
-cinnamoyl-8-oxotryptamine, by spectroscopic analyses. The remaining four compounds were predicted to be 
p
-coumaric acid amides of hydroxyputrescine, hydroxyagmatine, hydroxydehydroagmatine, and agmatine by mass spectrometry. The accumulation of two cinnamic acid amides was also induced by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Fusarium graminearum
</tp:taxon-name>
infection, and by treatment with CuCl 
2
, jasmonic acid, and isopentenyladenine. Antifungal activity of these amides was shown by inhibition of conidial germination and germ tube elongation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. graminearum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Alternaria brassicicola
</tp:taxon-name>
, indicating that they act as phytoalexins. The accumulation of these amides also detected in barley leaves treated with CuCl 
2
. We examined the accumulation of 25 phenylamides in 
B. sorokiniana-
infected wheat leaves using LC-MS/MS. Hydroxycinnamic acid amides of tryptamine, serotonin, putrescine, and agmatine, were induced after infection with 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. sorokiniana
</tp:taxon-name>
. Thus, the induced accumulation of two groups of phenylamides, cinnamic acid amides with indole amines, and 
p
-coumaric acid amides with putrescine and agmatine related amines, represents a major metabolic response of wheat to pathogen infection.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Plants possess various defense mechanisms to prevent pathogen infection, including phytoalexin accumulation. Phytoalexins are defined as low molecular weight anti-microbial compounds produced by plants in response to pathogen infection, which provide an inducible chemical barrier against pathogen attacks. The significance of phytoalexin accumulation in the interaction of plants with pathogenic microorganisms has been demonstrated experimentally. For example, incompatible combinations of oat (
<tp:taxon-name>
Avena sativa
</tp:taxon-name>
) cultivars and crown rust fungus (
<tp:taxon-name>
Puccinia coronata
</tp:taxon-name>
f. sp. 
avenae
) races were found to induce the accumulation of phytoalexins at high concentrations (

). Plants without the ability to produce phytoalexins were shown to be more susceptible to pathogenic infection compared with phytoalexin-producing wild 
type
plants in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Arabidopsis thaliana
(
Thomma et al., 1999
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. The genetically modified tobacco (
<tp:taxon-name>
Nicotiana tabacum
</tp:taxon-name>
) plant that accumulates a foreign phytoalexin, resveratrol, showed enhanced resistance to pathogens (

). Moreover, tolerance to phytoalexins, due to their degradation and exclusion, has been identified as a factor of virulence by pathogenic microorganisms (

).
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
species accumulate phytoalexins with diverse chemical structures, including phenylamides, flavonoids, and terpenoids. For example, rice (
<tp:taxon-name>
Oryza sativa
</tp:taxon-name>
) plants accumulate 19 phytoalexins; 14 labdane-related diterpenes (momilactones, oryzalexins, and phytocassanes), one casbene-type diterpene (
ent
-10-oxodepressin), one flavanone (sakuranetin), and two phenylamides (
N
-benzoyltryptamine and 
N
-cinnamoyltryptamine) (

,b; 

; 

; 

). In maize (
<tp:taxon-name>
Zea mays
</tp:taxon-name>
), the diterpenoids kauralexins and dolabralexins (

; 

) and sesquiterpenoid zealexins were identified as phytoalexins (

). In oats, avenanthramide phytoalexins, which are hydroxycinnamic acid amides with anthranilates, have been extensively studied in the interaction with crown rust fungus (

; 

). We previously showed that the dimer of serotonin and 3-(2-aminoethyl)-3-hydroxyindolin-2-one were induced in barley (
<tp:taxon-name>
Hordeum vulgare
</tp:taxon-name>
) leaves infected by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bipolaris sorokiniana
</tp:taxon-name>
, the causal agent of spot blotch of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
plants, and proposed that they serve as phytoalexins in barley (

). However, accumulation of phytoalexins has not been reported in wheat (
<tp:taxon-name>
Triticum aestivum
</tp:taxon-name>
).
</p>
         <p>
Phenylamides are amide compounds of hydroxycinnamic or benzoic acids with biogenic amines, which function in plant defense responses. Representative hydroxycinnamic acids composing phenylamides are cinnamic (Cin), 
p
-coumaric (Cou), caffeic (Caf), ferulic (Fer), and benzoic (
Ben
) acids, while amines parts were derived from tryptamine (Try), serotonin (Ser), tyramine (Tyr), agmatine (Agm), and putrescine (Put). Herein, we refer to specific phenylamides using combined abbreviations of the acid parts and amines, e.g. CinTry (cinnamoyltryptamine). Induced phenylamide accumulation has been reported in a wide range of plant species. In rice, infection by the brown spot fungus (
<tp:taxon-name>
Cochliobolus miyabeanus
</tp:taxon-name>
) induced the accumulation of FerTry, CouSer, and FerSer, together with Ser (

). In addition, rice leaves irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light accumulate CinTry, CinTyr, CouSer, and BenTry (

, 

). In barley, 

reported the induced accumulation of CouAgm in methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-treated leaves. Similarly, 

reported the accumulation of CouPut and Cou-3-hydroxy-Put, as well as CouAgm, in barley leaves treated with jasmonic acid (
JA
). In oats, avenanthramides, which are phytoalexins, are hydroxycinnamic acid amides with anthranilic acids (

).
</p>
         <p>
In wheat, benzoxazinoids (Bxs) are the representative defensive specialized metabolites (

, 

; 

). The major Bxs, 2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIBOA) and its 7- methoxy derivative (DIMBOA), are constitutively stored in vacuoles as glucosides (DIBOA-Glc and DIMBOA-Glc). Because of their anti-aphid, antimicrobial, and phytotoxic activities, Bxs are thought to function in the defense against various biological stresses (

; 

; 

, 

; 

; 

). Conversely, reports on inducible specialized metabolites in wheat are limited. From a metabolic analysis, 

found the differential accumulation of metabolites in rachis and spikelets of near isogenic wheat lines with resistant or susceptible alleles of 
Fhb1
upon 
<tp:taxon-name>
Fusarium graminearum
</tp:taxon-name>
infection. Phenolics, lignans, hydroxycinnamic acid amides (phenylamides), flavonoids, compounds related to signaling molecules, terpenoids, indole alkaloids, and compounds related to methionine biosynthesis were suggested to be involved in 
Fhb1
mediated resistance against 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. graminearum
</tp:taxon-name>
. Those authors suggested that cell-wall thickening due to the deposition of hydroxycinnamic acid amides and flavonoids was the potential resistance mechanism.
</p>
         <p>
Plants often activate multiple specialized metabolic pathways upon pathogen infection. Rice plants accumulate diterpenoid phytoalexins and a flavonoid phytoalexin in addition to serotonin and hydroxycinnamic amides, which are biosynthesized by different pathways. Similarly, maize plants accumulate Bxs as constitutive defensive compounds, and produce kauralexins, dolabralexins, and zealexins as phytoalexins in response to pathogen attack. This variety of defense compounds may be important for forming multiple layers of chemical barriers, which are effective against different classes of pathogens with different sensitivity to each compound. In addition, the multiplicity of defense metabolites may be important for preventing acquisition of tolerance against a specific compound. However, in wheat, the compounds involved in inducible defense mechanisms have not been identified, although the accumulation and function of Bxs have been widely studied. Since wheat is likely possess a phytoalexin defense mechanism, the leaves infected with 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. sorokiniana
</tp:taxon-name>
were metabolically profiled, and undescribed inducible phenylamides were identified. In addition, we analyzed the accumulation of other phenylamides in wheat leaves to characterize the activated metabolic pathways. This study provides a frame work of multiple chemical barriers endowed by phytoalexins in wheat that protect against pathogen attack.

was induced in leaves inoculated with

addition to a commonly detected fragment ion at

147 corresponding to coumaroyl moiety (

). The fragment ion at 
m/z
114 in
6
corresponded to an agmatine moiety. Differences in fragment ions among 
3–5
were due to the conversion of a guanidine group to amine (−42), the addition of a hydroxy group (+16), and dehydrogenation (−2) in an agmatine moiety, respectively. Accordingly, we predicted

2.2. Identification of 1 and 2
</title>
         <p>
We examined the effects of CuCl 
2
solution on wheat leaves, because CuCl 
2
acts as an elicitor for other plants (

); we found that the accumulation of 
1
and 
2
was also induced by the treatment with 0.5 mM CuCl 
2
solution for 72 h. Thus, we purified the compounds from 
98.4 g
of wheat leaves treated with 0.5 mM CuCl 
2
for 72 h.
</p>
         <p>
First, we describe the chemical structure of compound 
2
. Compound 
2
had the molecular formula C 
19
H 
16
O 
2
N 
2
, as determined by HRMS (
m/z
305.1284, [M+H] 
+
). 
1
H-NMR and COSY spectrum of 
2
(
Table 1
) showed two groups of aromatic proton signals at 
δΗ
7.30, 7.32, 7.59, and 8.27 ppm for a 1, 2-disubstituted benzene ring (ring A) and at 
δΗ
7.47–7.58 and 7.70 ppm for a monosubstituted benzene ring (ring B). In addition, 
1
H-NMR spectrum revealed the presence of two coupled double-bond protons (
δΗ
6.96 and 7.57 ppm, 
J
= 15.6 Hz), a methylene proton (
δΗ
4.73 ppm) and three 1H protons (
δΗ
8.53, 8.57, and 12.15 ppm).
</p>
         <p>
Although HRMS indicated the presence of 19 carbons in the structure, the 
13
C-NMR spectrum showed 17 carbon signals. In the HMQC spectrum, two carbon signals at 
δC
127.6 and 128.9 ppm showed cross-peaks with two 2H proton signals at 
δΗ
7.70 and 7.54 ppm, respectively, indicating that these signals corresponded to the 2- and 6-, and 3- and 5-positions of ring B. Because no correlation was detected for two 1H proton signals at 
δH
8.53 and 12.15 ppm in the HMQC spectrum, these signals correspond to active protons. All other protonated carbons were assigned using the HMQC spectrum.
</p>
         <p>
The presence of two carbonyl carbons was indicated by signals at 
δC
190.1 and 165.2 ppm in the 
13
C-NMR spectra. Taking the molecular formula into account, no oxygen atom was available for OH group, and thus, two active proton signals at 
δH
8.53 and 12.15 ppm were considered to correspond to NH signals. In the COSY spectrum, NH signals at 
δH
12.15 ppm showed a cross-peak with a 1H proton at 
δH
8.57 ppm. According to the HMBC spectrum, a 1H proton at 8.57 ppm (H-2) showed cross-peaks with carbon signals at 
δC
136.4 (C-7a), 125.4 (C- 3a), and 114.0 ppm (C-3). These results indicated that ring A, NH, C-3, and C-2 comprise an indole group (
Fig. 3
).
</p>
         <p>
The carbon signal at 
δC
134.9 ppm (C-1′) in ring B showed a cross-peak with the double-bond protons at 
δΗ
7.57 ppm (H-7′) in the HMBC spectrum, indicating a connection between C-1′ and C-7′. Two double-bond protons (H-7′ and H-8′) were connected to the carbonyl carbons (C-9′) at 
δC
165.2 ppm based on HMBC correlations, indicating the presence of a cinnamoyl moiety in the structure.
</p>
         <p>
The C-9′ signal showed a cross-peak with the –NH proton at 
δH
8.53 ppm in the HMBC spectrum, indicating an amide group (NH [NH-10] and C-9′). Furthermore, based on HMBC correlations, the linkages between this NH and the methylene group at 9-position, and between this methylene group and the carbonyl carbon at 8-position, are established.
</p>
         <p>
Then, this carbonyl carbon (C-8) was considered to bind to the quaternary carbon C- 
3 in
the indole moiety because no position can form a linkage in the molecule. The presence of a carbonyl group at 8- position was supported by the downfield shift of the H-2 proton (
δH
8.57 ppm) (

). Thus, we concluded that 
2
is 
N
-cinnamoyl- 8-oxotryptamine (
Fig. 2
).
</p>
         <p>
To confirm this conclusion, we attempted synthesis of compound 
2
by condensation of the 
N
-hydroxysuccinimide ester of cinnamic acid and 8-oxotryptamine. The reaction resulted in the formation of 
2
with a 31.2% yield, thereby confirming the identity of 
2
.
</p>
         <p>
Next, compound 
1
had the molecular formula C 
19
H 
16
O 
3
N 
2
, as determined by HRMS (
m/z
321.1229, [M+H] 
+
); thus, 
1
had an additional oxygen atom compared with 
2
. The 
1
H and 
13
C-NMR spectra of 
1
were similar to those of 
2
; however, there was a downfield shift in a methylene proton signal at 
δH
4.73 ppm (H-9) in 
2
to a methine proton signal at 
δH
6.48 ppm in 
1
(
Table 1
). This difference was attributable to the deshielding effect of the hydroxy group. Therefore, 
1
was the hydroxy derivative of 
2
at C-9, 
N
-cinnamoyl-9-hydroxy-8-oxotryptamine (
Fig. 2
). Correlations observed in the 2D NMR spectra were consistent with this structure (
Fig. 3
).

The kinetics of

accumulation were investigated in

</tp:taxon-name>
-infected leaves (
Fig. 4A
). The amounts of 
1

increased from 24 h after inoculation and reached maximum levels 48 h after inoculation, before levelling off thereafter. Compounds 
1
and 
2
were not detected in the control and intact leaves. Inoculation of

</tp:taxon-name>
also induced the accumulation of 
1
and 

2
in

leaves, as well as 

<tp:taxon-name>B. sorokiniana</tp:taxon-name>
,

and the amounts were 33.1 and 21.8 nmol/g fr. wt, respectively, 72 h after inoculation (
Fig. 4B
). To examine the localization of 
1
and 

2
in

B. sorokiniana-
and 
F. graminearum-
inoculated leaves, lesioned and healthy tissues were extracted separately and subjected to HPLC analysis. Compounds 
1
and 
2
were detected at high concentrations in the lesioned tissue of the inoculated leaves (
Fig. 4C and D
). The respective amounts of 
1
and 
2
were 587 and 286 nmol/g fr. wt in lesioned tissue in 
B. sorokiniana-
inoculated leaves, and 222 and 89.6 nmol/g fr. wt in those in 
F. graminearum-
inoculated leaves.
</p>
         <p>
We treated the third leaves with 0.5 mM CuCl 
2
, 1.0 mM jasmonic acid (
JA
), 0.5 mM isopentenyladenine (IP), and 1.0 mM salicylic acid (SA) for 72 h, and analyzed the accumulation of 
1
and 
2
(
Fig. 5
). Under CuCl 
2
treatment, the accumulation of 
1
and 
2
was induced, and their amounts were 72.3 and 15.3 nmol/g fr. wt, respectively. These compounds were also induced by treatment with 
JA
and IP, although to lower levels as compared with those in CuCl 
2
-treated and pathogen-infected leaves. The respective amounts of 
1

2
were 6.1 and 9.1 nmol/g fr. wt in the JA-treated leaves and 10.5 and 2.8 nmol/g fr. wt in IP-treated leaves.
</p>
         <p>
We determined the amounts of tryptamine and 8-oxotryptamine in wheat leaves 48 h after inoculation by LC-MS/MS using MRM methods, because these compounds are possible precursors of 
1
and 
2
. The accumulation of tryptamine and 8-oxotryptamine was also induced following inoculation with 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. sorokiniana
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. 6

Tryptamine was detected in intact and control leaves at concentrations of 3.6 and 0.7 nmol/g fr. wt, respectively. 8-Oxotryptamine was not detected in intact and control leaves. Accumulation of 9-hydroxy-8-oxotryptamine was not analyzed because the standard compound was not commercially available.

2.4. Accumulation of phenylamides in wheat leaves in response to pathogen infection

We determined the accumulated amounts of

5
) to 1,270 nmol/g fr. wt (

) (
Fig. 7
). Because all of the identified compounds in the present study were regarded as phenylamides, we examined the accumulation of other phenylamides in wheat leaves after 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. sorokiniana
</tp:taxon-name>
inoculation. We measured the amounts of 25 phenylamides composed by the combination of five acids (Cin, Cou, Caf, Fer, and 
Ben
) and five amines (Try, Ser, Tyr, Agm, and Put) by simultaneous analysis with LC-MS/MS as previously described (

). In 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
-infected leaves, we detected significant increases in CinPut, CouPut, FerPut, CinAgm, CouAgm, FerAgm, CinTry, CouTry, FerTry, CouSer, and FerSer (
Fig. 7
). CouAgm (
6
) accumulated at the highest concentration, followed by CouPut, FerAgm, FerPut, and FerSer. Compared with these amides, the amounts of CinPut, CinAgm, CinTry, CouTry, FerTry, and CouSer were low. CinSer and phenylamides containing benzoyl, caffeoyl, or tyramine moieties were not detected in the wheat leaves.

3. Discussion
</p>
         <p>
In the present study, we found that wheat leaves accumulated 
N
- cinnamoyl-9-hydroxy-8-oxotryptamine (
1
) and 
N
-cinnamoyl-8-oxotryptamine (
2
) in response to pathogen infection. Treatment with 
1
and 
2
inhibited conidial germination of phytopathogenic fungi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. graminearum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 

<tp:taxon-name>A. brassicicola</tp:taxon-name>
.

In addition, 
1
and 
2
significantly suppressed elongation of the conidial germ tubes of these fungi. Accordingly, these compounds are antimicrobial agents produced by wheat leaves in response to pathogen challenge, and thus, serve as phytoalexins in wheat. To our knowledge, this is the first report of phytoalexins in wheat.
</p>
         <p>
We detected 
1
and 
2
at 197 and 81.4 nmol/g fr. wt, respectively, in 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. sorokiniana
</tp:taxon-name>
-infected leaves 48 h after inoculation, and at 33.1 and 21.8 nmol/g fr. wt in 
F. graminearum-
infected leaves 72 h after inoculation. The accumulation of 
1
and 
2
was localized in the lesion, and the respective amounts were 587 and 286 nmol/g fr. wt in the lesion formed by 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. sorokiniana
</tp:taxon-name>

F. graminearum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. brassicicola
</tp:taxon-name>
at 1000 μM, and 
2
demonstrated marked inhibitory effects at concentrations exceeding 100 μM, although they did not inhibit the conidial germination of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. sorokiniana
</tp:taxon-name>
. Compound 
1
inhibited the elongation of conidial germ tubes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. sorokiniana
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. graminearum
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. brassicicola
</tp:taxon-name>
at 1000 μM. In addition, 
2
inhibited the elongation of conidial germ tubes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. graminearum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. brassicicola
</tp:taxon-name>
at concentrations higher than 10 μM. Considering the localized accumulation of these compounds, 
1
and 
2
likely exert antifungal activity as phenylamide-type phytoalexins at the site of infection.
</p>
         <p>
The accumulation of 
1
and 
2
was induced by treating wheat leaves with JA and IP. The role of JA in the induction of defensive responses against pathogen has been well established (

; 

). Recently, 

showed that treatment with JA and the synthetic cytokinin, 6-benzylaminopurine, induced the accumulation of phenylamides in rice leaves. In this respect, the accumulation of 
1
and 
2
was similar to that of phenylamide in rice leaves. Treatments with JA and cytokinin also induced the accumulation of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice leaves (


; 

). These findings suggest that cytokinin as well as JA are generally involved in the accumulation of phytoalexins in poaceous plants.
</p>
         <p>
Compounds 
3–5
, CouPut, FerPut, CouAgm (
6
), FerAgm, and FerSer accumulated at high concentrations in wheat leaves in response to 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. sorokiniana
</tp:taxon-name>
infection. Among the compounds, CouAgm has been reported to possess antifungal activity at high concentrations. CouAgm inhibited conidial germination and hyphae elongation in 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. brassicicola
</tp:taxon-name>
at concentrations higher than 1 mM (

). 

reported that the inhibition rate of conidial germination of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Monilinia fructicola
</tp:taxon-name>
was 24% at 0.20 mM, and 78% at 0.41 mM. Conversely, phenylamides bearing one or more phenol groups, including CouAgm, have been shown to be incorporated into cell walls and contribute to their reinforcement (

; 

; 

; 

). Thus, these phenylamides likely act as a substrate for cell-wall reinforcement in wheat. Indeed, the deposition of compounds containing a guanidino group in cell walls in response to pathogen attack has been shown in wheat and barley (

; 

). In contrast, 
1
and 
2
may function in chemical defense as phytoalexins, because these compounds lack the phenolic group required for oxidative polymerization and for binding the cell wall components. If this is the case, phenylamides in wheat may have dual roles as phytoalexins and as substrates for cell-wall reinforcement depending on their chemical structures.
</p>
         <p>
Phenylamides are biosynthesized by condensation reactions between amines and CoA thioesters. These reactions are catalyzed by acyltransferases in the BAHD family. In rice, genome-wide association studies have identified the genes encoding Put hydroxycinnamoyltransferases (PHTs), Agm hydroxycinnamoyltransferases (AHTs), Try hydroxycinnamoyltransferases (THTs), and Try benzoyltransferases (TBTs) (

). In barley the formation of CouAgm was shown to be catalyzed by Agm coumaroyltransfarase (ACT), which also belongs to the BAHD family of acyltransferases (

). A wheat ACT orthologue was suggested to be involved in 
<tp:taxon-name>Fusarium</tp:taxon-name>
head blight (FHB) resistance. Silencing the 
Taact
gene, which encodes an ACT, in a resistant wheat line resulted in decreased accumulation of CouAgm and CouPut, and reduced resistance to FHB (

). Conversely, the gene encoding the acyltransferase responsible for the condensation reaction between tryptamine and cinnamoyl-CoA has not been identified in wheat.
</p>
         <p>
We can hypothesize two routes for 
1
and 
2
biosynthesis; the direct condensation of 9-hydroxy-8-oxotryptamine and 8-oxotryptamine with Cin CoA thioester; and oxidation of CinTry that is formed by the condensation of tryptamine and Cin CoA. The accumulation of tryptamine and 8-oxotryptamine was induced in 
B. sorokiniana-
infected leaves. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the detection of 8-oxotryptamine in plants. The concentration of 8-oxotyryptamine was much lower than that of tryptamine, 
1,
and 
2
. In addition, we detected a small amount of CinTry in the 
B. sorokiniana-
infected leaves. Although these results were not enough to conclude the biosynthetic pathway, feeding experiments using labeled precursors, and determining the substrate specificity of the condensation enzyme would provide compelling evidence.
</p>
         <p>
In the present study, we found that 
1
and 
2
were present in barley leaves following CuCl 
2
treatment, but absent in rye, oat, rice, or maize. The phylogenetic relationship of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Triticeae</tp:taxon-name>
tribe indicates that wheat is closely related to rye (

). However, compounds 
1
and

were found in more distantly related two 
<tp:taxon-name>Triticeae</tp:taxon-name>
species, i.e., wheat and barley. Conversely, the induced accumulation of other phenylamides has been reported in various poaceous species, such as barley (

), oat (

), rice (

), and maize (

). Thus, phenylamide accumulation may be a basic defense response shared by poaceous species. The accumulation of 
1

2
is a specific modification of the basic pathway in wheat and barley.

4. Conclusion
</title>
         <p>
In this study, two undescribed phenylamides, 
N
-cinnamoyl-9-hydroxy-8-oxotryptamine (
1
) and 
N
-cinnamoyl-8-oxotryptamine (
2
), were discovered to serve as phytoalexins in wheat. In addition, the accumulation of 14 phenylamides was induced in response to pathogen infection. Notably, high concentrations of Cou–OH–Put (
3
), Cou–OH–Agm (
4
), Cou–OH–dehydroAgm (
5
), and CouAgm (
6
) were found in the pathogen-infected leaves. These findings suggest that phenylamide accumulation plays a major role in defense mechanisms against pathogen attack in wheat.
