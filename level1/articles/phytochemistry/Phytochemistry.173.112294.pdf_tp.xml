‘Siberia’ is a cultivar that is prominent and highly favored by consumers due to its snowy white color and strong floral scent. Here, two terpene synthase genes (

‘Siberia’ were cloned and functionally characterized. Recombinant LoTPS2 specifically catalyzed the formation of (

Recombinant LoTPS4 is a multiproduct enzyme that produces D-limonene and β- myrcene as major volatile compounds and β- phellandrene, (+)-4-carene and 3-carene as minor products from GPP. Furthermore, LoTPS4 generates trans-α- bergamotene as a major product and di-epi-α- cedrene, α- cubebene and (

analysis showed that 
LoTPS2
was highly expressed in the petals and sepals of the flower, while 
LoTPS4
was highly expressed in the filament of the flower. Moreover, mechanical wounding of flowers revealed that 
LoTPS2
showed a strong response to wounding via a rapid increase in its mRNA transcript level. Our results will assist scientists in exploring the molecular mechanisms of terpene biosynthesis in this species and will provide new insight into the biotechnological modification of the floral bouquet in

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Floral scents are an important characteristic conferred by volatile compounds that play several key roles in flowering plants, primarily functioning to attract pollinators, particularly via long-distance communication (

; 

). Floral scents also play a significant role in plant defense against biotic and abiotic stresses by exerting toxic or deterrent activity against herbivores and microbes, repelling pests, minimizing damage caused by oxidative stress and ameliorating the effects of high temperatures (

; 

; 

). Floral fragrance is imperative critical characteristic that improves the aesthetic value of ornamental plants (

; 

). In addition, floral scent shows an important communication channel between plants and animals (

).
</p>
         <p>
Floral fragrance is determined by a diverse mixture of low-molecular-weight compounds exhibiting high vapor pressures and low boiling points at ambient temperatures (

). Floral volatile compounds belong to 3 major groups: terpenoids, benzenoids/ phenylpropanoid, and derivatives of fatty acids. Among these major groups, the terpenoids are the largest class of floral volatiles, are structurally diverse and are the most abundant group of specialized plant metabolites (

). Terpenoids originate from two interconvertible five-carbon compounds, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), which are derived from two alternative but compartmentally separated pathways. In the cytosol, peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum, IPP is derived from acetyl-CoA through mevalonic acid (MVA) pathways, whereas in the plastids, it is synthesized from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate (G3P) by methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways (

; 

; 

). Although, subcellular compartmentation permits these pathways to act separately, metabolic ‘crosstalk’ has been revealed between them (

), especially from plastids to the cytosol (

; 

). The consecutive head-to-tail condensation of IPP and DMAPP by prenyltransferases produces the direct precursors of terpenes: geranyl diphosphate (GPP), geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) in plastids, and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) in the cytosol. Thereafter, terpene synthase (TPS) converts GPP, FPP, and GGPP into cyclic and acyclic monoterpenes (
C
10
), sesquiterpenes (
C
15
) and diterpenes (
C
20
), respectively. Terpene synthases (TPSs) are the key enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathways of terpenoids (

; 

; 

). TPS genes have been isolated and characterized from a variety of plants to study floral scent formation in ornamental plants.

The genus

includes very popular scented bulb flower species with high economic and ornamental value. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium

holds a prominent position in the world's fresh cut flower market, and its members used as potted and common landscape flowers in gardens because of their variety of colors and beautiful shapes (

). Among the species in this genus, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’ (Oriental hybrid) is a very popular and unique flower because of its pure snowy white color and the strong scent that it releases, and this variety is highly appreciated by consumers. Oriental hybrid lilies (
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
) are derived from interspecific hybridization among species of the section 
<tp:taxon-name>Archelirion</tp:taxon-name>
, including 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium auratum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium speciosum
(
Yamagishi et al., 2018
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. The majority of the fragrance produced in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’ is found in the sepals and petals, which are the key parts involved in floral scent emission (

). Moreover, the emission pattern of the floral bouquet typically matches the pollinator's activity, following a diurnal circadian rhythm (

; 

).

         <p>
Floral scent formation and regulation in this spectacular breed have been ignored thus far, and the mechanism of floral scent production has not been characterized. Here, we report two terpene synthase genes involved in floral fragrance formation in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’. As 
<tp:taxon-name>

2.1. Phylogenetic analysis
</title>
         <p>
The full-length open reading frames (ORF) of two terpene synthase genes designated 
LoTPS2
and 
LoTPS4
were identified from lily transcriptome unigenes (unpublished data) and amplified through 
PCR
from the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’ cDNA. 
LoTPS2
exhibits a putative ORF of 2265 bp and encodes a protein of 754 aa with a molecular mass of 87.7 kDa. Similarly, 
LoTPS4
exhibits a putative ORF of 1749 bp encoding a protein of 583 aa with a calculated molecular mass of 68.7 kDa. Plant terpene synthases are grouped into seven different subfamilies/clades, designated TPS-a through TPS-g, based on the relatedness of their amino acid sequences (

). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that LoTPS2 belongs to the TPS-f group (
Fig. 1a
). All TPS-f clade proteins, including LoTPS2 isolated in this study, contain 221 aa corresponding to the conifer diterpene internal sequence (CDIS) domain (

; 

) (
Fig. 1b
). The highly conserved aspartate-rich motifs DDxxD and NSE/DTE which chelate divalent metal ions (especially Mg 
2+
) are also present in the Cterminal domains of both LoTPS2 and LoTPS4. Furthermore, LoTPS4 belongs to the TPS-b subfamily, which mainly contains angiosperm monoterpene synthases. The arginine-tryptophan rich motif RRX 
8
W is found at the N-terminus of LoTPS4 but is absent in LoTPS2 (
Fig. 1c
). LoTPS4 also contains conserved RxR motifs upstream of DDxxD, which are modified to RxK motifs in LoTPS2. These motifs may take part in the initiation of the isomerization-cyclization reaction (

). The accession numbers of the genes are given in Supplementary Table 1.

2.2. Functional characterization of LoTPS2 and LoTPS4
</title>
         <p>
To examine the enzymatic activity of LoTPS2 and LoTPS 

4 
in

vitro, the full-length coding regions of corresponding recombinant proteins were overexpressed in the pET30a vector using 
<tp:taxon-name>
Escherichia coli
</tp:taxon-name>
Rosetta-gammi 
B
(
DE
3) competent cells, and their activity was assayed with the potential substrates GPP, FPP, and GGPP. Incubation of the recombinant LoTPS2 protein with FPP resulted in the production of (
E
, 
E
)- α- farnesene, whereas no product was found when GPP and GGPP were used as substrates (
Fig. 2
). Similarly, no product was found in the control (extracts of 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. coli
</tp:taxon-name>
expressing the empty vector in the presence of FPP).
</p>
         <p>
LoTPS4 generated D-limonene (46.82%) and β- myrcene (31.65%) as its major products and β- phellandrene (10.22%), (+)-4-carene (9.07%) and 3-carene (2.24%) as its minor products when it was incubated in the presence of GPP (
Fig. 3
). Furthermore, recombinant LoTPS4 synthesized four sesquiterpenes, trans-α- bergamotene (56.84%), di-epi-α- cedrene (2.68%), α- cubebene (19.67%), and (
E
)-β- farnesene (20.81%) from FPP 
in vitro
(
Fig. 4b
). However, LoTPS4 did not produce any compounds when GGPP was used as a substrate (
Fig. 4a
).

2.3. Expression analysis of the LoTPS2 and LoTPS4 genes
</title>
         <p>
Quantitative real-time 
PCR
was performed to determine the expression of the 
LoTPS2
and 
LoTPS4
genes in various 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’ organ tissues (root, bulb, stem, leaf, petal, sepal, stigma, anther and filament) (
Figs. 5
and 
6
). The highest expression of 
LoTPS2
was observed in the petals followed by the sepals, which are the key plant parts exhibiting the highest aroma levels, indicating their major involvement in floral scent formation (
Fig. 5a
). Furthermore, 
LoTPS2
showed lower expression in all other organs (
Fig. 5a
). In contrast, 
LoTPS4
showed the highest expression level in the filament, followed by the stigma, sepals and petals of the flower, (
Fig. 5b
).
</p>
         <p>
The mRNA expression levels of 
LoTPS2
and 
LoTPS4
were analyzed using blooming flowers from six different fragrance 
types
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
varieties. The results showed that 
LoTPS2
was most highly expressed in the strongly scented 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’, followed by ‘Acapulco’ and ‘Manissa’, which are moderately scented varieties; whereas its expression was lower in ‘Longiflorum’ (
Fig. 5c
). 
LoTPS4
was most highly expressed in ‘Acapulco’, followed by ‘Longiflorum’ and ‘Siberia’ (
Fig. 5d
).
</p>
         <p>
To investigate the relative expression of 
LoTPS2
and 
LoTPS4
, the flower development process was divided into five stages, designated D1 (flower bud), D2 (slightly open), D3 (half open), D4 (fully bloom), and D5 (flower senescence) (
Fig. 6
). 
LoTPS2
showed the highest expression in full-bloom flowers, whereas lower expression was observed at the D3 and D5 stages, and its expression was almost undetectable at the D1 and D2 stages (
Fig. 7a
). However, 
LoTPS4
showed the highest expression at the D1 stage and lower expression at the D3 and D5 stages (
Fig. 7b
). To determine the expression patterns of LoTPS2 and LoTPS4, flower development was divided into two categories: from the bud stage to full-bloom stage and from the full-bloom stage to the three days later, to examine the circadian expression pattern at 8 h intervals. During flower development, there was no expression of the 
LoTPS2
mRNA transcript before 48 h, and the transcript level started to increase thereafter (
Fig. 7c
). In contrast, the mRNA transcript levels of 
LoTPS4
were highest at the bud stage and began to decline with the development of flowers, then increased again at the full-bloom stage (
Fig. 7d
). Over the course of a day/night cycle, 
LoTPS2
expression followed a strong diurnal rhythm, with peak expression levels in the morning (8:00), followed by the afternoon (16:00) and deep night (24:00) (
Fig. 8a
). Similarly, the emission of (
E
, 
E
) α- farnesene followed a diurnal circadian pattern, with the highest emission in the morning, followed by deep night and afternoon (
Fig. 8c
). Over the course of a day/night cycle, 
LoTPS4
showed random expression and did not follow any circadian pattern in its expression (
Fig. 8b
). D-limonene also showed a random emission pattern (
Fig. 8d
).

2.4. The expression of LoTPSs and emission of volatiles was induced by mechanical wounding
</title>
         <p>
Previous research has indicated that terpene synthases (especially sesqui-TPSs and mono-TPSs) are involved in floral defense and airborne signaling under certain conditions. The results revealed that 
LoTPS2
showed a quick response to mechanical wounding in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’, indicating its possible involvement in a defense reaction, signaling or attraction of pollinators. The mRNA transcript level of 
LoTPS2
started to increase after 1/5 h after wounding and peaked after 1 h (~2.6 fold–higher expression compared to the control) (
Fig. 9a
). At 1 h after wounding, the transcript levels began to decrease, then rapidly increased after 6 h (~2.4 fold-higher expressions) and declined thereafter. Similarly, the emission of (
E
, 
E
)-α- farnesene was undetectable before 2 h after wounding; however, its emission started increase after 4 h, and maximum emission was observed at 6 h, followed by 8 h, compared to the control (
Fig. 9b
). 
A
similar response is observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Artemisia annua
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lotus japonicas
</tp:taxon-name>
when they are subjected to wounding, resulting in higher transcript levels of TPSs (

; 

). On the other hand, 
LoTPS4
did not show any response to wounding injury.

2.5. Subcellular localization of LoTPSs
</title>
         <p>
The analysis of putative targeting sequences with different algorithms did not provide consistent predictions about the subcellular localization of the LoTPS2 protein, suggesting the presence of either a cytosolic/nuclear localization or chloroplast targeting sequence. To experimentally determine the subcellular localization of the LoTPS2 protein, transient expression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was performed in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Arabidopsis
</tp:taxon-name>
protoplasts. The full-length fragment beginning with the start codon of the 
LoTPS2
gene was introduced in frame into the vector p35 S-EGFP-1 and the construct transferred to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Arabidopsis
</tp:taxon-name>
protoplasts, which were subsequently examined for transient GFP expression through confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The results showed that the fusion of LoTPS2 with GFP localized to the cytosol (
Fig. 10
). In contrast, LoTPS4 was predicted to possess an N-terminal targeting peptide that is present in chloroplast monoterpene synthases but absent in cytosolic sesquiterpene synthases. To verify the actual subcellular localization of LoTPS4, constructs including the N-terminal 80 aa and the full-length peptide of LoTPS4 were generated as described above. The results showed that both the Nterminal and full-length peptides of LoTPS4 were located in plastids. The GFP constructs evidently supported the localization of LoTPS2 to the cytosol (
Fig. 10e–h
) and LoTPS4 to the plastids (
Fig. 10
i-p). Furthermore, HcTPS7 from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hedychium coronarium
</tp:taxon-name>
was observed as a positive control (

).

3.1. Phylogenetic analysis of LoTPSs
</title>
         <p>
According to phylogenetic analysis, LoTPS2 was grouped in the TPSf clade/subfamily of terpene synthases, which includes 
<tp:taxon-name>
Clarkia breweri
</tp:taxon-name>
mono-TPSs (

), 
<tp:taxon-name>Actinidia deliciosa</tp:taxon-name>

Malus domestica

</tp:taxon-name>
30 (

) and 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
04 (

). Interestingly, although LoTPS2 is not a di-TPS, it contains a conserved conifer diterpene internal sequence (CDIS) domain near the N-terminal region, which is a unique property of TPS-f clade members and di-TPSs (
Fig. 1
). It is assumed that this structural constituent existed in a general di-TPS ancestor and was lost during the evolution of mono-TPSs and sesqui-TPSs (

; 

). In addition, DDxxD and NSE/DTE motifs present at the C-terminus are responsible for the synchronization of divalent metal ions and substrate binding (

). In contrast, LoTPS4 belongs to the TPS-b clade, which includes the majority of mono-TPSs, mostly consisting of angiosperm mono-TPSs (

). The TPS-b subfamily frequently includes RRX 
8
W motifs, for the cyclization of mono-TPSs and plastid domains located in the N-terminal region of TPSs (

). The phylogenetic tree indicates that LoTPS2 and LoTPS4 might have exhibited diverse functions in floral scent formation during evolution.

Analysis of 
LoTPS2
and 
LoTPS4
expression levels in different organs and tissues of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’ indicated that 
LoTPS2
was expressed in all plant parts, showing the highest levels in the petals followed by the sepals of the flower, which are the major sources of floral scent emissions (
Fig. 5
). In contrast to 
LoTPS2
, 
LoTPS4
was most highly expressed in the filament of the flower, followed by the sepals and anthers of the flower. Our findings are consistent with a previous study showing that sepals and petals are the main sources of flower scent emissions (

; 

; 

). In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’, 
LoTPS1
and 
LoTPS3
are highly expressed in the sepals and petals of the flower (

). In kiwifruit, two terpene synthases are responsible for the production of sesquiterpenes and are released mainly from the floral components of the plant (

). Similarly, in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Syringa oblata
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. oblata
var. 
alba
, 
SoLIM
</tp:taxon-name>
is responsible for the production of limonene and is specifically expressed in the floral components of the plant (

). During flower developmental stages, the mRNA accumulation of 
LoTPS2
was very low at the flower bud stage and peaked at the full-bloom stage, then decreased at the senescence stage (
Fig. 6
). Thus, the expression of 
LoTPS2
is developmentally-regulated and correlates with the floral scent emission pattern. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’, the emission of monoterpenes and the expression of 
LoTPS1
and 
LoTPS3
gradually increase with the development of flowers (

). 
LoTPS4
showed the highest expression beginning in the bud stage, while the D-limonene began to be released at the full-bloom stage. 
A
similar pattern is observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. oblata
var. 
alba
</tp:taxon-name>
, in which 
SoLIM
shows its highest expression at the bud stage (

).
</p>
         <p>
In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’, floral scent emissions exhibit rhythmic day/night rhythmic patterns. Under natural light conditions (12 h light/12 h dark), the expression pattern of 
LoTPS2
exhibits a diurnal circadian rhythm, with peak expression observed in the morning, followed by the afternoon and deep night (
Fig. 8a
). Likewise, the emission pattern of α-farnesene follows a diurnal circadian rhythm, peaking in the morning (
Fig. 8b
). However, 
LoTPS4
expression did not follow any circadian pattern (
Fig. 7b
). Nevertheless, the emission of D-limonene showed weak circadian oscillation (
Fig. 8d
). Our results are consistent with previous research showing that floral scent emissions in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’ exhibit diurnal circadian oscillations (

, 

). The expression of TPS genes and the emission of monoterpenes are positively correlated with each other (

). In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phalaenopsis bellina
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. violacea
</tp:taxon-name>
flowers, the emission of monoterpenes occurs during the daytime and their emission is mainly affected by the circadian clock (

). Most plants release the maximum amount of terpenoids in the daytime, regulated by an internal circadian clock or light (

). The emission of volatile organic compounds is highly regulated, and most of species are entertained to emit their scent compounds at a particular time during the day (

).
</p>
         <p>
Moreover, the 
LoTPS2
gene responds to wounding injury of a flower (
Fig. 9
). Terpenoids play roles in signaling to other plants, defense against herbivores, insect repellences, and pollinator attraction and are the primary contributors to the chemical arsenal of plants (

; 

). In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Populus trichocarpa
, 
PtTPS
</tp:taxon-name>
2
is responsible for the biosynthesis of (
E
, 
E
)-α- farnesene and increases transcript abundance upon herbivory attack (

). Furthermore, the accumulation of 
HcFPPS
mRNA in 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. coronarium
</tp:taxon-name>
is induced by herbivory and mechanical injury (

). Similarly, an increase in the emission of farnesene and bergamotene is observed in maize upon herbivory attack (

).

3.3. Functional characterization of LoTPS2 and LoTPS4
</title>
         <p>
Terpenoids are a structurally diverse group of specialized plant metabolites that play numerous ecophysiological roles in plant life. Here, two monoterpene synthases (
LoTPS2
and 
LoTPS4
) were cloned and functionally characterized. LoTPS2 is a sesquiterpene synthase that is responsible for the biosynthesis of (
E
, 
E
)-α- farnesene from FPP, whereas it produced no product when incubated with GPP or GGPP (
Fig. 2
). Previous studies have shown that (
E
, 
E
)-α- farnesene is involved in the conditioning and attraction of honeybees and other insects (

; 

). α- Farnesene also contributes to the scent properties of some fruits including melons (

) and apples (

). (
E
, 
E
)-α- farnesene plays a defensive role and acts as an attractant upon herbivory attack (

). Similarly, 
AFS1
cloned from the peel tissue of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Malus domestica
</tp:taxon-name>
fruit was shown to be responsible for the formation of (
E
, 
E
)-α- farnesene exclusively from FPP and to be involved in the production of ethylene (

).
</p>
         <p>
In contrast to LoTPS2, LoTPS4 is a multiproduct enzyme that utilizes both GPP and FPP to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, respectively. LoTPS4 produces multiple monoterpenes (predominantly Dlimonene) from GPP and multiple sesquiterpenes (predominantly transα- bergamotene) from FPP. Numerous terpene synthases have been found that are capable of producing several terpenes from a single substrate (

LaLIMS
from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lavandula angustifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
flowers produces a blend of numerous monoterpenes, with limonene as a major product and terpinolene, pinene, camphene, α- phellandrene, and β- myrcene as minor products generated from GPP (

). Similarly, 
LaBERS
from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lavandula angustifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
produces trans-α- bergamotene as a major product, while (
E
)-nerolidol, (
Z
)-α- bisabolene, (
E
)-β- farnesene and β- phellandrene are produced in smaller amounts from FPP. 
Cl
(+) 
LIMS1
and 
Cl
(+) 
LIMS2
from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Citrus limon
</tp:taxon-name>
generates almost exclusively limonene, with a lesser amount of α- pinene and β- myrcene from GPP (

). Limonene has many biochemical effects and is also recognized as an anticancer agent. Limonene has also been considered to be a safer food additive as compared to synthetic (

; 

). To our knowledge, this is the first report of limonene synthase from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’. Limonene possesses anti-carcinogenic properties and is widely used in the cosmetic and beverage industries (

; 

). The introduction of limonene synthase genes from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. breweri
</tp:taxon-name>
into petunia resulted in linalool synthase production which repels aphids (

).
</p>
         <p>
In plants, the biosynthesis of monoterpenes normally occurs in plastids, where GPP is synthesized, while the formation of sesquiterpenes occurs in the cytosol, where FPP is generated (

; 

). 
A
subcellular localization study confirmed LoTPS2 to be localized to the cytosol, where it specifically catalyzes the transformation of FPP into (
E
, 
E
)-α- farnesene, whereas LoTPS4 localizes to plastids. Metabolic engineering of terpene synthase genes in tobacco, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Arabidopsis
, Fragaria species
</tp:taxon-name>
and potato showed the existence of a small pool of GPP in the cytosol and FPP in the plastids (

; 

; 

). Likewise, 
TPS02
from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Arabidopsis
</tp:taxon-name>
is able to utilize both GPP and FPP to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, respectively (

). However, the presence of different amounts of substrate (high FPP/low GPP in the cytosol and vice versa in plastids) would permit dual activity of the enzyme to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in both locations. LoTPS4 probably acts mainly as a monoterpene synthase, as sesquiterpene products produced by LoTPS4 were detected in the floral volatile profile of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’ at some stages under the experimental conditions of the present study.
</p>
         <p>
In conclusion, we functionally characterized two terpene synthases that are responsible for the production of floral scent in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lilium
</tp:taxon-name>
‘Siberia’ and localize to different compartments. LoTPS2 is a sesqui-TPS responsible for the biosynthesis of (
E
, 
E
)-α- farnesene exclusively from FPP, whereas LoTPS4 is a multiproduct terpene synthase that synthesizes both monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes from GPP and FPP, respectively. Our findings lay a molecular foundation for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying floral scent production.
