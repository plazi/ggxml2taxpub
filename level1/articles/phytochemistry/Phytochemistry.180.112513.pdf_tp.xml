         <p>ABSTRACT</p>
         <p>The prevalence of obesity is increasing rapidly globally and has recently reached pandemic proportions. It is a multifactorial disorder linked to a number of non-communicable diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Over-nutrition and a sedentary lifestyle are considered the most significant causes of obesity; a healthy lifestyle and behavioural interventions are the most powerful ways to achieve successful weight loss, but to maintain this in the long term can prove difficult for many individuals, without medical intervention. Various pharmacological anti-obesogenic drugs have been tested and marketed in the past and have been moderately successful in the management of obesity, but their adverse effects on human health often outweigh the benefits. Natural products from plants, either in the form of crude extracts or purified phytochemicals, have been shown to have anti-obesogenic properties and are generally considered as nontoxic and cost-effective compared to synthetic alternatives. These plant products combat obesity by targeting the various pathways and/or regulatory functions intricately linked to obesity. Their mechanisms of action include inhibition of pancreatic lipase activities, an increase in energy expenditure, appetite regulation, lipolytic effects, and inhibition of white adipose tissue development. In this review, we discuss the distinct anti-obesogenic properties of recently reported plant extracts and specific bioactive compounds, along with their molecular mechanisms of action. This review will provide a common platform for understanding the different causes of obesity and the possible approaches to using plant products in tackling this worldwide health issue.</p>

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Obesity can be defined as a body mass index (BMI; weight in kg/ square of the body height in metres) of over 
30 kg
/m 
2
(

). Obesity is an international issue and a risk factor for other diseases including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, type-2 diabetes, asthma, atherosclerosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Correa ˆand Rogero, 2019; 

; 

). Obesity and being overweight are the fifth leading causes of death globally (

). According to one estimation, approximately 921 million people were obese or overweight throughout the world in 1980 and by 2013 this number had increased to 2.1 billion (

; 

) – increasing from approximately 20%–30% of the global population. It is now widely acknowledged that the imbalance between the intake and expenditure of energy results in obesity (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Sedentary lifestyles and other environmental risk factors are considered major causes of obesity (
Fig. 1
) but they are not entirely responsible: genetic mutations can also lead to the condition (

). Mutations in genes such as Leptin (LEP), leptin receptor (LEPR), prohormone convertase 1 (PCSK1), melanocortin receptor (
MC4R
), proopiomelanocortin (
POMC
), single-minded homolog 1 (SIM), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been reported to be associated with obesity (

; Farooqi and O’ rahilly, 2008).
</p>
         <p>
There are a number of options for the treatment of obesity. These focus on changes in lifestyle, such as control of diet, physical exercise, weight-loss medications, and weight-loss surgeries (

; 

). Physiological interventions such as exercise and dieting are the preferred ways to reverse weight gain, but due to the modern lifestyle, these activities seem to be challenging to practice and maintain in the modern world. This has therefore created a need for pharmacological interventions. Demand for anti-obesogenic drugs and weight loss therapies has accelerated the development of these interventions within the global pharmaceutical industry (

). Pharmacological interventions can aid the management of weight loss by altering processes such as absorption of calories, altering appetite, preventing or altering the development of adipose tissue, and regulating the metabolism of the body. However, related adverse effects hinder their usage and limit their beneficial effects (

). A significant example of this is Meridia (sibutramine), which acts as an appetite suppressant by inhibiting neurotransmitters within the brain and was withdrawn in 2010 from the 
US
and Canadian markets due to adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, resulting in heart attacks and strokes. In the same year, Xenical (orlistat), another weight loss drug, underwent revised labeling due to reported adverse effects on the liver (

). Some other commercially available pharmacological drugs, including metformin, exenatide, rimonabant, and pramlintide have also been reported to cause abdominal pain, sleeplessness, restlessness, cardiovascular problems, and incontinence (

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

; DPPR 

; 

; 

). Due to these adverse effects, natural products are now often preferred over pharmacological drugs, in the management of weight loss. Furthermore, many natural products have been consumed for this purpose for hundreds of years and are often considered as nontoxic and more effective than pharmacological drugs (

). An ideal anti-obesity drug should be able to control weight gain, with little or no side effects (

) and pharmacological anti-obesogenic drugs should be prescribed only if their beneficial effects outweigh the adverse effects. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on the development of drugs from natural plant products due to their perceived effectiveness and minimal or absent side effects. In addition, plant-based products, either as standardized extracts or pure compounds, have historically provided innumerable opportunities for the discovery of drugs, due to their lack of adverse effects and wide chemical diversity (

).

         <p>This review will comprehensively outline the anti-obesogenic mechanisms of action of plant products. Their mechanisms of action include: inhibitory effects on the activity of lipases such as pancreatic lipase, increase in the expenditure of energy via processes such as brown adipogenesis, appetite suppression through control of leptin and ghrelin levels, enhancing the expression of lipolytic proteins such as hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and adipocytes triglycerides lipase (ATGL), and the inhibition of white adipose tissue (WAT) development.</p>

2. Inhibition of pancreatic lipase (PL) activity
</title>
         <p>
Lipids are essential to all living organisms:they are the building blocks of cellular membranes, can act as thermal isolators, and serve as a source of stored energy in the body. Nonetheless, excessive long-term intake of dietary lipids is one of the major causes in the development of obesity and is linked with other significant co-morbidities. Inhibition of dietary lipid digestion is an important approach in combating obesity, and a logical target for many anti-obesogenic pharmaceutical agents. Interference with the hydrolysis of lipids results in the reduction of the utilization of ingested lipids. Therefore, inhibition of lipases, responsible for the digestion and absorption of lipids, results in the decreased absorption of fats (

). Consequently, one of the strategies for the screening and discovery of potential anti-obesogenic products is to investigate their inhibitory effects upon lipases. (

). A key example is pancreatic lipase (PL, also known as triacylglycerol acyl hydrolase), the principal enzyme of pancreatic juice, synthesized and secreted by the pancreas, and associated with absorption of dietary fats (G.N. 

). Dietary fats are usually consumed as a collection of triglycerides (TGs) that before absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, undergo a series of biochemical reactions (

). Ninety percent of dietary fat consists of TGs and they must be hydrolyzed prior to absorption. The products of TG hydrolysis are monoglycerides, and free fatty acids (FFAs); these 
<tp:taxon-name>form mixed</tp:taxon-name>
micelles with cholesterol, lysophosphatidic acid, and bile salts. The micelles are then absorbed into enterocytes where TGs are resynthesized and then stored in mature adipocytes as an energy source (

). An excess of these TGs in adipocytes is directly linked to obesity (
Fig. 2
). PL plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of TGs and is responsible for the processing of 50–70% of total dietary fat (

). Inhibition of this enzyme is therefore one of the approaches used to combat obesity.
</p>
         <p>
PL inhibition is being widely studied to evaluate the potential of natural products to inhibit dietary fat absorption (

; G. N. 

; 

). The blockbuster drug, orlistat, sold under the trade name Xenical, acts through the inhibition of pancreatic lipase and is used commercially as an anti-obesogenic drug. Orlistat is synthesized from the natural product lipstatin, a known lipase inhibitor (

). Many plant extracts and their specific isolated bioactive compounds identified through their anti-obesogenic effects demonstrate inhibition of porcine pancreatic lipase activity 
in vitro
(
Table 1
).

screened 32 medicinal plants found in 
Malaysia
for their anti-porcine PL activity 
in vitro
. Among those, the extracts of four plants (

<tp:taxon-name>Eleusine indica</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Myristica fragrans, Melastoma</tp:taxon-name>
candidum

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phyla nodiflora
</tp:taxon-name>
) showed the highest inhibitory effects (31.3%, 20.3%, 19.720% and 18.2% inhibition of PL activity at 100 μg/mL respectively). Recently, 

reported the porcine PL inhibitory effects of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Gymnema inodorum
</tp:taxon-name>
extract. The extract inhibited the activity of PL in a dose-dependent manner with IC 
50
value of 982 μg/mL. Another study by G.N. 

reported the inhibitory effects of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Diospyros kaki
</tp:taxon-name>
fruit, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Citrus unshiu
</tp:taxon-name>
peel mixture extract (PCM) on porcine PL activity 
in vitro.
The same group also then evaluated the anti-obesogenic effects of this mixture 
in vivo
in high fat-diet (HFD) mice. The IC 
50
value against the PL activity levels found for PCM was 
0.5 mg
/mL. In addition, total cholesterol levels, serum triacylglycerol and visceral fat weight were significantly reduced when compared to the control HFD mice, which suggested that the administration of PCM might have reduced the absorption of fats by inhibiting the activity of PL. Similarly, 

showed porcine PL inhibitory effects of the ethanolic extracts of pomegranate leaves, it was observed that the extract inhibited the activity of PL in a dose-dependent manner.

In addition to plant crude extracts, specific bioactive compounds from plants have also been shown to possess inhibitory effects on PL activity. 

documented the porcine PL inhibitory effects of trilactone terpenes, including ginkgolides and bilobalide. The results revealed that ginkgolides A &amp; B and bilobalide inhibited the activity of PL with IC 
50
values of 22.9, 90.0, and 60.1 μg/mL, respectively. Apigenin has been shown to have activity against porcine PL, with inhibition rates exceeding 50% at a concentration of 0.8 mM (

). Similarly, quercetin, its monoglycoside and diglycoside forms, isoquercetin and rutin, inhibited the activity of porcine PL (IC 
50
) at concentrations of 1.49, 0.97 and 
1.1 mg
/mL (

). C-glycosidic flavones are also reported to inhibit porcine PL activity with IC 
50
values ranging from 18.5 
±
2.6 to 50.5 
±
3.9 μM (

). Glycosyl groups at positions 6 and 8 of the A ring showed maximum inhibitory effects on the activities of PL (

). Two other hydroxylated methoxy flavones, 3,7-dihydroxy-4 

′

methoxyflavone and 3,7,3 

′

-trihydroxy-4 

′

-methoxyflavone have also been shown to inhibit the activity of porcine PL (

). These two compounds inhibited the activity of PL by 21.8 and 24.8% respectively at a concentration of 100 μM. Dioscin, isolated from methanol extract of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dioscorea nipponica

powder, also inhibited PL activity (IC 
50
) at 20 μg/mL (

Among those, broussonone A showed a non-competitive inhibitory effect on the activity of porcine PL with an IC 
50
value of 28.4 μM.

3. Increase in energy expenditure
</title>
         <p>
Adipose tissue in mammals has classically been characterized into 
two types
based on morphology, functions, and anatomical locations: white adipose tissue (WAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT) (

). WAT and BAT, both originate from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (

) through a well-orchestrated process known as adipogenesis (
Fig. 3
). Both of these tissues store energy in the form of lipids, whilst BAT contributes to dissipation of the stored energy in the form of heat (

). WAT is mainly responsible for the storage of energy in the form of TGs. BAT supports control of core body temperature by a specialized process known as adaptive or non-shivering thermogenesis, in which chemical energy is transformed into heat (

). Correspondingly, BAT protects against obesity due to its ability to dissipate calories as heat (

). BAT activity is inversely related to the occurrence of obesity (

). BAT releases heat from the available nutrients via a process that is uncoupled from the production of ATP by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) (

). UCP1 is the central activator of the thermogenic effect and induction of its expression by natural anti-obesogenic plant products is one route to reduce obesity (

; 

). The expression of UCP 
1 in
WAT has also been reported in recent years (

). Over-expression of UCP1 causes ‘browning’ of WAT, thus known as brite or beige adipose tissue. Browning is usually induced by hormonal stimulation and cold exposure. Brite or beige adipocytes are similar to BAT adipocytes in that they also generate heat by utilizing the available lipids in the body (

). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ 1 coactivator (PGC-1) regulates the expression of UCP1 during the development of brown fat or exposure to external stimuli such as cold or diet (

; 

). PGC-1α is considered the founding member of the PGC-1 family. It increases mitochondrial biogenesis and is a critical regulator of BAT thermogenesis (

). Similarly, sirtuin 1 (
SIRT
1) is also known to play a key role in stimulating and activating brown adipogenesis, activating browning of WAT, and retarding the expansion of WAT (

). Interest in the prevention of obesity by regulation of non-shivering thermogenesis in BAT and brite adipose tissue through phytochemicals has been rapidly increasing, due to their potential for minimal side effects.

</p>
         <p>
Various phytochemicals (
Table 2 A and B
) have previously been reported to activate browning of WAT and brown adipogenesis. For example, genistein upregulates the expression of PGC1-α and UCP1 (Aziz et al., 2017), hence promoting brown adipogenesis. Similarly, Formononetin, capsaicin, and myricetin have been shown to induce the browning of WAT by upregulating the genes, and transcriptional factors specifically expressed in BAT (

; 

). Capsaicin has been reported to activate the genes responsible for browning of WAT, including UCP1 and bone morphogenetic protein 8b (BMP8b) in WAT. Moreover, it also activates the energy sensor protein of the body, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), 
SIRT
1 and PGC-1 α (

; 

). AMPK is obligatory for the proper functioning of BAT (

), and its activation correspondingly increases during brown adipogenesis (

). 

reported the anti-adipogenic and thermogenic effects of silibinin. Silibinin (a natural flavonoligan and the main active constituent of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Silybum marianum
</tp:taxon-name>
, also known as milk thistle) at a concentration of 10 μM increased the gene expressions of UCPs (UCP1, 2 and 3), PGC-1α, PPAR-α and 
SIRT
1. Moreover, it also decreased the expression of key adipogenic genes, PPAR-γ, fatty acid-binding protein-4 (FABP4) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Likewise, phyllodulcin, a natural sweetener found in certain 
types
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hydrangea
</tp:taxon-name>
, also activates the browning of WAT by enhancing the expression of thermogenic genes in subcutaneous WAT (E. 

). Cinnamaldehyde and thymol are also reported to act as browning agents. Cinnamaldehyde is one of the most abundant phytochemicals found in cinnamon and has been used for various medicinal purposes since medieval times (

). Cinnamaldehyde decreases the accumulation of visceral fat in a dose-dependent manner; in part by stimulating the interscapular BAT. It also increases the expression levels of UCP 
1 in
high fat and high sucrose diet-fed mice (

; 

). Thymol is a monoterpene phenolic compound and raises the expression of brown fat-specific markers and protein levels, i.e. PGC-1α, HSL, UCP1, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). Moreover, it also leads to increased phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (

). 

showed the synergistic effect of quercetin and resveratrol on WAT in rats. The combination of these two compounds significantly induced browning in the perirenal WAT of rats. Moreover, it also induced the protein expression of UCP 
1 in
the interscapular BAT. Apigenin and naringenin have also been shown to cause elevated expression of UCP 
1 in
BAT in a dose-dependent manner (

). Similarly, the prenylated flavonoid xanthohumol obtained from the hop plant (
<tp:taxon-name>
Humulus lupulus
</tp:taxon-name>
), activates the thermogenic program of adipose tissue (

). Xanthohumol has been shown to increase the energy expenditure in various 
types
of tissues including WAT and BAT, and its administration inhibits ATP synthase, increases the consumption level of oxygen and reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to activation of AMPK and PGC-1α (

; 

). Luteolin was shown to upregulate thermogenic genes and enhance energy expenditure in subcutaneous and brown adipose tissue (

). It increased UCP1 expression and activated AMPK/PGC-1α signaling in C57BL/6 mice (

). The inhibition of AMPK reversed the thermogenic effects of luteolin confirming its interaction with AMPK/PGC-1α signaling (

). Chrysin (

) and magnolol (

) were also shown to have the same effect. They upregulated the expression of genes and proteins involved in the regulation of brown adipogenesis such as UCP1, PGC-1α and PR-domain containing 16 (PRDM-16) in 3T3-L1adipocytes. PRDM-16 is an essential transcriptional factor involved in the differentiation of brown adipocytes (

). Caffeine also induces brown adipogenesis (

; Rebollo-hernanz et al., 2019; 

), and hence increases thermogenesis. Exposure of mouse-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MMSCs) to caffeine, induced the expression of UCP1 and enhanced cell metabolism and oxygen consumption. Additionally, caffeine also increased the expression of PGC-1α and mitochondrial biogenesis together with other BAT and beige specific gene markers (

). A polyphenolic compound, resveratrol has also been shown to induce the formation of brown-like adipocytes in WAT (

). It significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression of brown adipocyte marker genes such as UCP1 and PRDM- 

16 
in

vitro. Moreover, treatment with resveratrol also markedly increased the phosphorylation of AMPKα1 subunit. The browning-inducing effect of resveratrol was reversed in cells lacking AMPKα1 subunit, demonstrating that resveratrol induces brown-like adipocytes through activation of AMPK α1 (

). Other phytochemicals such as curcumin (

), sudachitin (

), genicetin (

), myricetin (

) and berberine (

) also enhance brown adipogenesis. They either enhance the thermogenic activity of BAT by increasing the expression of BAT specific genes and transcriptional factors or enhance the browning of WAT by specifically expressing the genes and proteins involved in the process.

4. Appetite suppressors
</title>
         <p>
High-calorie intake is the root cause of obesity. Various kinds of dietary supplements, marketed as appetite suppressors are already targeting a desperate overweight and obese population (

). The search for natural and safe appetite-suppressing agents has sparked special interest in industry and the general population throughout the world (

). The regulation of body weight and control of appetite is a multifactorial problem. Various hormonal and neurological signals regulate the state of satiety in human bodies (

). Neural signal peptides, for instance, dopamine, histamine and serotonin and their associated receptors are correlated with the state of satiety, and these may be the targets of specific phytochemicals/plants crude extracts in the treatment of obesity (

). Plant products that give a perceived enhancement of satiety through an increase in adrenaline level and activation of the sympathetic nervous system are considered beneficial for controlling weight gain (

; 

). Hormones associated with adiposity are thought to be the main communicators of body energy status to the central nervous system (

). Two prominent and well-known hormones associated with hunger and food intake are leptin and ghrelin (

). They regulate food intake, hunger, energy homeostasis, and promote satiety by interacting with the hypothalamus in the brain (

) and are known to have a major impact on the balance of energy. Leptin mediates long term regulation of energy balance whereas ghrelin is known to be a fast-acting hormone, and it seems to play a role in meal initiation (

).

4.1. Leptin
</title>
         <p>
Leptin is mainly produced by mature adipocytes in white adipose tissue, but its effects extend across the body, targeting for example the heart, kidneys, and sympathetic nervous system (Gonz´alez-Castejon´and 

). Leptin is a peptide hormone that mediates its effects through leptin receptors (
LEPR
) located primarily in the hypothalamus of brain. Activation of these receptors can regulate food intake, promote satiety and energy homeostasis by initiating different signaling cascades (

; 

; 

; 

). Primarily, leptin acts as an energy sensor and causes reduction of appetite via signaling through the hypothalamus (

), but in obesogenic conditions, leptin signaling is impaired, resulting in an excessive drive to eat, a condition known as hyperphagia (

). Overexpression of leptin genes and the resultant increased levels of leptin in the blood are known to cause leptin-resistance as the hypothalamus of the brain becomes less sensitive due to over activation of receptors. Synthesis and secretion of leptin are dependent on various factors such as growth hormone, insulin, steroid hormone and glucose levels (

). Targeting these factors, or leptin synthesis and secretion directly with plant products is a potential approach to combat obesity.
</p>
         <p>
In the past, different plant products had been tested for their appetite suppressive effects and the treatment of obesity (
Table 3
). Resveratrol decreased the secretion of leptin in rat adipocytes, and orally administered resveratrol significantly reduced the blood leptin concentration in mice exhibiting hyperleptinemia (

). In another study, resveratrol directly decreased the level of leptin secretion in isolated rat adipocytes, when treated with insulin and glucose (

). Similarly, administration of 
2800 mg
/day of hydroxy citric acid (HCA), an extract from 

G. 
Cambogia

, resulted in a reduction in food intake, serum leptin level, and baseline body weight in humans (

; 

). And in the same vein, purified anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-glucoside) from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Morus australis
Poir
</tp:taxon-name>
significantly decreased the leptin secretion levels, alongside other factors such as adipocyte size, lipid accumulation and weight gain in HFD C57BL/6 mice (

; 

). Catechin is also thought to have inhibitory effects on the excess secretion of leptin. It has been shown in clinical trials that the administration of catechin ranging from 
270 to 1200 mg
/day resulted in reduced body weight and lowering of serum leptin levels (

; 

). Epigallocatechin 3 Gallate (EGCG) and capsaicin are also known to have appetite suppressing effects and increase the sensation of fullness, and decrease the desire to eat (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
In addition to the aforementioned bioactive compounds, plant extracts (
<tp:taxon-name>
Prunus mume
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lithospermum erythrorhizon
</tp:taxon-name>
) synergistically prevent the impairment of energy, glucose, and lipid regulation, through potentiating hypothalamic leptin and insulin signaling in rats (

). Likewise, 

reported the effects of blueberry and mulberry juice on the secretion of leptin in high fat-diet (HFD) obese mice. The juice significantly reduced serum leptin levels when compared to control HFD mice.

4.2. Ghrelin
</title>
         <p>
Ghrelin is a 28 amino acid peptide acetylated on serine 3, which is synthesized in the stomach but it has also been identified in other tissues such as the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, adrenal cortex and ovary (

). It binds to and activates the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), leading to stimulation of food uptake, fat deposition and growth hormone release (

; 

). The hypothalamus modifies the energy status of the body by sensing peripheral ghrelin levels (

). Lowering the secretion of ghrelin is therefore another strategy for fighting weight gain. Numerous plant products have been shown to inhibit the abnormal secretion of ghrelin. 

showed that a combination of South American herbal extracts reduced food intake through gastrointestinal hormone modulation in obese and overweight women. They showed that these combined extracts decreased acylated ghrelin levels, an active isoform of ghrelin, after mealtimes, indicating the appetite suppressing effects of these extracts. Similarly, 

reported that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dolichos biflorus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Piper betle
</tp:taxon-name>
extracts (herbal formulation LI10903F) significantly reduced serum ghrelin levels in 50 human subjects after eight weeks of supplementation. Extracts of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phaseolus vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
have also been shown to control appetite in human subjects when given as supplements with mixed meals to 12 volunteers. Three hours after meal consumption, the extracts of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
suppressed secretion of ghrelin and effected the sensation of satiety, inducing a lower desire to eat (

). A compound known as P57, isolated from a South African succulent of the Hoodia family has been shown to act as a prominent appetite suppressor in preclinical trials (

). It has been used in preclinical studies and shown to have a good safety profile and significantly promoted weight loss in dogs, mice and rats (

). Similarly, other extracts and herbal supplements such as 

<tp:taxon-name>Citrus aurantium</tp:taxon-name>
,

ephedra and hydroxy citric acid also exhibit appetite suppressing properties (

). Based on these studies, it can be concluded that plant products show promise for use as appetite regulating agents in obesogenic conditions.

5. Regulation of lipid metabolism
</title>
         <p>
A key step in the metabolism of lipids from stored fat is lipolysis (

). Control of lipolysis has significant potential for the development of anti-obesogenic products (

). Lipolysis is the breakdown of TGs to 
<tp:taxon-name>form monoglycerides</tp:taxon-name>
and free fatty acids, which can be used by other tissues.Adipose tissue is the only tissue that has the ability to hydrolyze stored TGs and mobilize fatty acids into the bloodstream (

). Lipolysis is a key step in the absorption and accumulation of fats in mature adipocytes.Initially,it was thought that the most important enzyme in the process of lipolysis is HSL, but, with the advancement of knowledge, it was revealed that two other enzymes, ATGL and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) are also involved in the breakdown of lipids to free fatty acids (

). Therefore, complete hydrolysis of TGs into fatty acids in adipose tissue is dependent on the activities of ATGL,HSL, and MAGL (O’ 

). HSL is mostly found in both brown and white adipose tissue (

). HSL and ATGL are known to be the main lipases in WAT, and the mobilization of fatty acids by WAT is dependent on the activity of these two lipases. Together they are also considered to be responsible for 95% of the total hydrolysis of TGs in adipocytes (

; 

). ATGL is primarily responsible for the hydrolysis of TGs, while HSL is known to preferentially hydrolyze diglycerides (DGs), with a tenfold higher effect than on TGs (

). AMPK is also known to be involved in lipid metabolism (lipolysis), and increased activity levels can be achieved by administering plant products such as berberine and resveratrol (O’ 

). Similarly, β- adrenergic receptor activation is also known to cause lipolysis in white adipocytes (

)
,
illustrating that altering the expression of key regulatory enzymes involved in lipolysis can prove advantageous in the fight against obesity.
</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>
There are a number of reports evidencing the lipolytic effects of plant products or specific phytochemicals (
Table 4
). G´omez-Zorita et al. (2013) showed the lipolytic effect of resveratrol. Resveratrol significantly stimulated the expression of HSL but not ATGL in genetically obese rats. In another study, 

reported the lipolytic effects of resveratrol through ATGL management. Resveratrol enhanced the gene and protein level of ATGL in adipose tissue, and it was concluded that lipolytic effects regulated by resveratrol in human and murine adipocytes are through mainly changes in ATGL levels. 18β- Glycyrrhetinic acid and Ginkgolide C are also reported to enhance lipolysis. 18β- Glycyrrhetinic enhances lipolysis, and enhances the mRNA level of HSL and ATGL (

). Ginkgolide C increases the production of lipolytic proteins (ATGL and HSL) and activates AMPK (

). Similarly, the flavonoid quercetin has also been shown to induce lipolysis. In OP9 cells, which were induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes, quercetin dose-dependently induced lipolysis in these cells by enhancing the expression of both HSL (
&gt;
2-fold) and ATGL (
&gt;
4-fold) (

). 

showed the lipolytic effects of berberine in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Berberine extracted from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Coptis chinensis
</tp:taxon-name>
increased the expression of ATGL and phosphorylated HSL (p-HSL) in a time-dependent manner, and reduced TG level by 10% in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, it was also revealed that AMPK was involved in the enhanced expression of p-HSL and ATGL after treatment with berberine in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Likewise, ursolic acid (a pentacyclic triterpenoid) stimulated lipolysis in primary-cultured rat adipocytes (

). It was shown that ursolic acid increased lipolysis by translocating the HSL to the lipid droplet from the cytosol and inhibiting perilipin A expression. It was also observed that ursolic acid upregulated the expression of ATGL.

Apart from specific phytochemicals, crude plant extracts also exhibit lipolytic effects. Black soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is rich in anthocyanins. Its ethanolic extract was shown to enhance the activity of AMPK, HSL, and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in mesenteric fat of C57BL/6N mice (S.Y. 

). Extract of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Vigna angularis
</tp:taxon-name>
(Black adzuki bean) also showed anti-obesogenic and lipolytic effects. The extract significantly decreased the accumulation of TGs in a dose-dependent manner and enhanced the expression of prominent lipolytic genes for HSL to 457%, at 
1 mg
/mL concentration. Similarly, the mRNA expression of ATGL was enhanced to 303% at 
1 mg
/mL and 427% at 
2 mg
/mL (M. M. 

). 

reported the anti-obesogenic and lipolytic effects of methanolic extract of black garlic. The extract significantly enhanced lipolysis and increased the expression of ATGL and HSL along with other anti-adipogenic genes.
</p>
         <p>Based on these reports, it is clear that plant products either in the form of crude extracts or specific phytochemicals have latent lipolysis regulating effects. Further investigation is needed for these compounds to be used as anti-obesogenic agents after successful clinical trials.</p>

6. Adipocyte differentiation
</title>
         <p>
Adipose tissue controls energy balance and the homeostasis of lipids. Excessive calorie intake and low energy expenditure can result in hypertrophy and hyperplasia of adipocytes (

), two of the primary detrimental conditions, which relate to adipose tissue. Hyperplasia is the recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the adipogenic lineage, resulting in an increase in the number of adipocytes in WAT (

). Similarly, hypertrophy refers to the expansion in the size of mature WAT adipocytes due to increased calorie intake and lipid accumulation. Mature WAT adipocytes store TGs and release them when necessary, in response to energy demands. Blocking of the principal factors that influence the development of new adipocytes, by natural products may prove effective in the development of anti-obesity therapies (

; 

). The development of WAT from pre-adipocytes is a well-defined process, known as white adipogenesis, which is regulated by a cascade of positive and negative regulators (

). PPAR-γ is a critical pro-adipogenic transcription factor that positively regulates the differentiation of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes (

). Positive regulators of adipogenesis have been shown to induce the activation of PPAR-γ mRNA. Members of CCCAAT/enhancer binding protein family (C/EBPs), some of the kruppel like factors (KLFs) (

) and early beta-cell factors 1 and 2 (EBF 1 and 2) (

) are inducers of PPAR-γ mRNA, hence promote adipocyte differentiation. Repressors of adipogenesis include members of the KLFs family such as KLF 2, 
3
, 7, 
16
(M.K. 

,b; 

; 

; 

), GATA-binding factors 2 and 3 (GATA 2,3) (

), Wnt/β- catenin signaling (T. 

), and the Hh signaling pathway (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
It has been shown that plant products can inhibit the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature white adipocytes through up- or downregulation of these negative and positive adipogenic factors (
Table 5 A and B
). For example, 6-gingerol, found in ginger, inhibits adipogenic differentiation through activation of the Wnt/β- catenin signaling pathway (

). This compound was shown to lower the mRNA levels of key adipogenic and lipogenic factors in 3T3-L1 cells such as mRNA levels of C/EBP-α, PPAR-γ, and protein expression of FAS and ACC through the activation of Wnt/β- catenin signaling pathway. Similarly, toosendanin, a triterpenoid, has also been shown recently to inhibit adipogenesis through the Wnt/β- catenin dependent pathway (T. 

,b). Toosendanin significantly reduces the expression of central adipogenic factors C/EBP-α and PPAR-γ, FAS, and ACC through activation of the Wnt/β- catenin dependent pathway in 3T3-L1 cells and 
in vivo
in male C57 BL/C6 mice (T. 

). Loganic acid (oral administration with 10 and 
50 mg
/kg/day) significantly inhibits total fat increase, fatty hepatocyte deposition in the liver, body weight gain, and adipocyte enlargement in the abdominal visceral fat tissues in ovariectomized mice and also inhibits the expression of positive regulators of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells (

). In another study, the administration of isobavachalcone isolated from the Japanese 
Angelica keiskei
plant resulted in decreased adipocyte proliferation by 38.6% at day 2 (D2) and 31.0% at day 8 (D8). It also reduced intracellular lipid contents by 75% and decreased the protein levels of PPAR- 
γ
and C/EBP 
-
α. Levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein -1c (SREBP-1c), ACC1, and FAS mRNA in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were also lowered (

). Caffeic acid and hydroxytyrosol have also been reported to have anti-adipogenic properties and suppress the protein expression levels of PPAR-γ (

). Recently an anthocyanin, Delphinidin-3-O-β- glucoside (D3G) has also been shown to inhibit the differentiation of pre-adipocytes, reduce lipid accumulation, and downregulate key lipogenic and adipogenic markers, SREBP-1, PPAR- 
γ
, C/EBP-α and FAS in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (

).

-trimethoxychalcone was the most potent one. It inhibited cellular lipid accumulation by 75%–90% in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly two other flavonoids (flavones), 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (

) and 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3 

′

,4 

′

-hexamethoxyflavone (

) have also been shown to attenuate white adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and HFD-induced obese mice. Pterostilbene has also been shown to have anti-adipogenic effects (

). It reduces the accumulation of lipids and suppresses the expression of positive central regulators of adipogenesis i-e PPAR-γ, C/EBP-α, adipocyte protein 2 (aP2) and C/EBP-β (

). Tangeretin, nobiletin and hesperetin also show the same effect. They reduce triglyceride levels and downregulate the expression level of PPAR-γ in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes (J. 

). Similarly, anthocyanins from 
Vitis coignetiae
enhance AMPK activation, decrease the number of lipid droplets, reduce TG level and inhibit the expression of PPAR-γ, C/EBP-α,- β and REBP-1c in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (

). Oxyresveratrol and cyanomaclurin also show the same effect: they reduce TG contents in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells (

). Moreover, they also inhibits cell proliferation, induce cell cycle arrest, and down-regulate the expression of PPAR- 
γ
and C/EBP 
-
α (

). Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside from 
Solidago virgaurea
also inhibits the differentiation of pre-adipocytes through suppression of PPAR-γ and C/EBP-α expression (Y.S. 

). Tricin, a hydroxylated methoxyflavone, inhibits the lipid accumulation in 
3
T3-L1 adipocytes by 37% at 6 μg/mL and significantly decreases the mRNA level of PPAR-γ, CEBPs/and SREBP-1 at 1.5 μg/mL concentration (

). Recently purpurin has also been reported to reduce blood glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides levels 
in Male C
57BL/6 mice and inhibit differentiation of 
3
T3-L1 adipocytes apparently by activation of AMPK (

).

besides the specific bioactive compounds of plants
, crude extracts can also have anti-adipogenic effects. Combined extracts of green coffee, cinnamon, and ginger significantly decrease the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), TGs, and total lipids in obese Sprague-Dawley rats (

). Gyeongshingangjeehwan 18 (GGEx18), a herbal composition from 
Rheum palmatum
L, 
Laminaria japonica
Aresch and 
Ephedra sinica
reduces lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by 41%, 54% and 70% at 0.1, 1 and 10 μg/mL concentrations respectively. It also decreases visceral adipose tissue weight by 46% and 24% at 250 and 
500 mg
/kg doses in HFD C57BL/6J mice (

). Similarly, 
Curcuma longa
L extracts also showed anti-adipogenic effects in Sprague Dawely rats (J. H. 

). The extract suppressed adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis, decreased mRNA expression of FAS, ACC, aP-2 and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (J. H. 

). 
Camellia sinensis
extract reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α) genes, serum leptin level and inhibits the absorption of fatty acids, resulting in reduce body weight and fat accumulation in HFD rats (

). Extracts of 
Tropaeolum majus
have also been shown to reduce triglyceride level up to 25.8%–54.7%, decrease PPAR-γ expression level by 23.0%–90.4% and C/EBP-α by 45.8% and 71.9% at different concentrations in

7. Summary and outlook
</title>
         <p>
Obesity is a common disorder caused by the interaction of behavioural, environmental, genetic and nutritional factors, and its prevalence is accelerating worldwide. Excessive consumption of calorific foods, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles are the predominant causative factors for this rise in obesity. Returning to healthy lifestyles, for example, daily exercise and reducing excessive calorific intake is the surest route to successful weight loss, but for many, it is extremely challenging to maintain. For decades, synthetic chemicals have been developed as anti-obesogenic drugs. Despite generating positive results, they have also caused adverse effects that muted their benefits. Traditionally used medicinal plants, which contain a wide range of natural chemicals, have been used for the treatment of many infectious as well as chronic disorders including obesity. These natural products from plants may play a supportive role in combating obesity by helping obese people to lose weight. There is also potential for synergistic activity, conferred by the combination of multiple natural products to increase their anti-obesogenic activities and mode of action on multiple targets, which may prove to be advantageous over other chemical treatments. Previously published results regarding anti-obesogenic compounds, are either based on 
in vitro
(cell) studies or mouse models and therefore do not guarantee the same results in humans. Additional preclinical development followed by appropriate clinical trials must therefore be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of bioactive compounds to understand their safety, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Clinical trials should be planned carefully to evaluate both immediate and long-term side effects of these bioactive compounds. An investigation into promising targets and identification of unique regulators of both WAT and BAT development are still needed for formulating appropriate natural products as drugs against obesity. In conclusion, natural products derived from medicinal plants, have the potential if developed appropriately, to deliver anti-obesogenic drugs that could play a central role in the management of obesity.
