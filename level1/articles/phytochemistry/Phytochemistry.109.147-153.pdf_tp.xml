Six withanolides (
1–6
), as well as two known withanolides (physachenolide D 
7
and withanoside VI 
8
), were isolated from the aerial parts of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Physalis coztomatl
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Solanaceae</tp:taxon-name>
). Structural elucidations of 
1–6
were achieved through 2D NMR and other spectroscopic techniques, while the structure of 
1
was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. In addition, the stereochemical orientation of the 17-hydroxy group in

withanolides was discussed in relation to C NMR shifts of C-12, 13, 14 and 16. Such analysis established that coagulansin A contains a 17 
2
-hydroxy moiety rather than the reported 17 
β
-hydroxy functionality, and has been revised accordingly.

The 
<tp:taxon-name>
Physalis
</tp:taxon-name>
genus of 
<tp:taxon-name>Solanaceae</tp:taxon-name>
continues to be a rich source of modified and highly-oxygenated C 
28
ergostane-type steroids with C-17 lactone/lactol side-chain substituents, collectively known as withanolides (Chen et al., 2011; Misico et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012a). Recently the isolation of a series of such compounds were reported, with structural variations in both the steroidal nucleus as well as the side-chain, from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Physalis hispida
(Cao et al., 2014)
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Physalis longifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
(Zhang et al., 2011, 2012b). In continuing this research, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Physalis coztomatl
(Mociño &amp; Sessé) Ex Dunal
</tp:taxon-name>
was cultivated and the aerial parts examined. Herein the isolation and structure elucidation of an array of new (
1–6
) and known (
7
and 
8
) withanolides are reported, which are relatively more polar than those (physacoztolides A–E) previously reported in the same species (Pérez-Castorena et al., 2006).

1
was determined to be C 
32
H 
42
O

by HRESIMS and NMR experiments, equating to twelve double-bond equivalents. The IR absorptions of 
1
indicated the presence of double bond (1640 cm 

—
1

), as well as hydroxy (3260 cm 

—
1

) and ester (1740 cm

), groups. The 
1
H NMR data of 
1
(Table 1) displayed ten deshielded protons [

J

J

J

J
= 10.0, 4.8, 2.4 Hz), 7.01 (1H, s), 7.21 (1H, s), and 9.76 (1H, s)], as well as six shielded CH 
3
groups [

1.28 (3H, s), 1.76 (3H, s), 1.85 (3H, s), 2.02 (3H, s), 2.09 (3H, s), and 2.19 (3H, s)]. In addition to these CH 
3
groups, the 
13
C NMR (APT) and HSQC data established a further 26 carbon signals which were differentiated into seven CH 
2
[including an oxygenated (
δ
C
65.4)], seven CH [including three olefinic (
δ
C
146.2, 128.4, and 126.3) and two oxygenated (
δ
C
82.2 and 77.5)], as well as twelve C [including a keto (
δ
C
204.4), three ester (
δ
C
171.5, 171.2 and 167.2), three olefinic (
δ
C
151.2, 135.6 and 122.1), and three oxygenated (
δ
C
86.0, 80.3 and 79.7)] groups, which corresponded to C 
32
H 
39
(Table 2). The remaining three hydrogen atoms were therefore assigned as OH groups, indicating the presence of a five-ringed structure.

Withanolides

are highly oxygenated steroids with oxygenation at C-14, 17 and 20. In addition, 
1–4
present additional oxygenation at C-18, whereas both C-15 and C-18 are oxygenated in withanolide 
1
. Furthermore, withanolides 
1–4

7
have a 17

5
and 
6
contain a 17 
2
hydroxy moiety. It has been reported in the literature that the stereochemistry of the 17-hydroxy substituent can be determined by

C NMR shifts of C-12, 13, 14, and 16; where an observed 3–5 ppm difference can distinguish between a pair of 17-

(C-12, 13, 14, 16: 
δ
C
23.8, 55.2, 85.7, 34.3), where the 17-OH and 20-OH groups induce the 
γ
-effect (Table 2). Comparing these values it becomes apparent that shielding of C-12, C-13 and C-16 (but not C-14) is observed when a 17 
2
-OH is present. Conversely, the presence of a 17 
β
-OH substituent results in the shielding of C-14, whereas C-12, C-13 and C-16 remain unaffected. Analogous shift differences are consistent with the published data of other 17-

iso

withanolide, namely withacoagulin D (Huang et al., 2009). Not only are the reported 
13
C NMR spectroscopic data sets of these two withanolides superimposable, but they are very similar to reported data of other 17

-OH withanolides rather than 17 
β
-OH withanolides. For instance, the C-12 to C-16 
13
C NMR data of coagulin A (
δ
C
27.0, 51.0, 84.0, 32.0, 33.0) (Jahan et al., 2010) are similar to those of the 17

-OH, yet quite different to those of 17 
β

C
30.1, 53.7, 81.4, 31.9, 35.7) (Abdeljebbar et al., 2007).

Optical rotations were measured with a Rudolph RS Autopol IV automatic polarimeter. IR data were obtained with a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 380 FT-IR spectrometer.

Column chromatography (CC) was performed on CombiFlash columns (Teledyne Isco, Lincoln, NE). Normal-phase silica gel G TLC plates (w/UV 254) and reversed-phase C 
18
TLC plates (w/UV 254) (Sorbent Technologies, Atlanta, GA) were used for fractionation and compound detection. The spots were visualized using UV light at 254 nm and spraying with 10% EtOH-sulfuric acid reagent. Semi-preparative HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1200 unit equipped with a DAD detector, utilizing a Lichrospher RP-18 column (250 
×
10 mm, 5 µm).
