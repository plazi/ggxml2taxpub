         <p>
In this study, the popular food and medicinal herb 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ophiopogon japonicus
</tp:taxon-name>
was investigated alongside a 70% ethanol extract of its rhizomes, revealing twenty-three steroidal glycosides with four undescribed steroidal saponins, named ophiopogonols A–D. Among them, ophiopogonols A–B are two unusual spirostanols with a rearranged A/B ring system (5/7/6/5/5/6 ring system) that have not previously been identified in plants. The chemical structures of all isolated steroidal glycosides were elucidated by comprehensive analysis through chemical methods, HRESIMS, and NMR spectroscopy. Further, putative biosynthetic pathways for ophiopogonols A–B were proposed. In addition, based on traditional applications of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. japonicus
</tp:taxon-name>
, cytotoxic effects of the isolates were evaluated using human large cell lung carcinoma cells (NCI–H460 cells). Sprengerinin C displayed a remarkable cytotoxic effect with IC 
50
values of 2.1 ± 0.8 μM by inducing apoptosis and G2/M phase cycle arrest in the NCI–H460 cell line.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
Ophiopogon japonicus
(Thunb.) Ker-Gawl. (Asparagaceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
is widely regarded as both a functional food and a traditional Chinese herb and is distributed throughout 
East Asia
(

). The rhizome of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. japonicus
</tp:taxon-name>
, which is the herb’ s primary medicinal component, is used in treatment or prevention of lung diseases based on its traditional applications for nourishing yin and moisturizing lung tissue when used alone or in combination with other drugs (

). The most representative constituents of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. japonicus
</tp:taxon-name>
are steroidal saponins, polysaccharides, and homoisoflavonoids (

). In particular, steroidal saponins, one of the quality control constituents of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. japonicus
</tp:taxon-name>
, exhibit multiple pharmacological activities, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, antineoplastic, antitussive, and cardiovascular protective effects (

; 

); therefore, they have attracted increasing attention in phytochemistry and pharmacology.
</p>
         <p>
Steroidal saponins are abundant in food and medicinal plants of families 
<tp:taxon-name>Dioscoreaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Liliaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, and Scrophuhrhceae (

). An increasing number of steroidal saponins have been discovered, garnering interest due to their unusual structures and excellent therapeutic effects. Steroidal saponins are considered the major bioactive compounds in monocotyledon (

), with a series of biological activities such as antitumor (

), immunomodulation (

), antimicrobial (

), and cardiovascular protective activities (

). Structurally, most aglycones are polycyclic with 27 carbon atoms, possessing one spiroketal center, which connects the E and F rings (

). Bufospirostenin A, an unusual steroid and the only example of a spirostanol with A/B rings, was previously obtained from the collected gallbladders and venom of the toad 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bufo bufo gargarizans
</tp:taxon-name>
in 2017 (

). It has a [5-7-6-5-5-6] hexacyclic rearranged skeleton and shows inhibitory activity against Na/K ATPase (21% and 43% inhibition at 12.5 and 25.0 μM, respectively). Due to their chemical diversity and wide spectrum of biological activities, steroidal saponins are not only a class of natural product but also a natural source of therapeutic agents.
</p>
         <p>
In this study, a series of Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) rich in steroidal saponins were screened. Four undescribed steroidal saponins and nineteen known compounds were isolated and identified from the 70% ethanol extract of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. japonicus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. 1
). Notably, ophiopogonol A and ophiopogonol B, two spirostanols with rearranged A/B ring system, were obtained from plants for the first time. Furthermore, a putative biosynthetic pathway of the two unusual steroidal saponins and the cytotoxicity of the isolates are also described.

Ophiopogonol A (

(calcd. 431.3161 for C

), as indicated by HRESIMS. In the 
1
H NMR spectrum, the proton resonances for four methyl proton groups at 
δ

J
= 7.0 Hz, H 
3
-21), and 1.35 (3H, s, H 
3
-19), one olefinic proton at 5.67 (1H, brs, H-6), and oxymethylene protons at 
δ
H
3.49 (H-26a) and 3.58 (H-26b) were observed. The 
13
C NMR spectrum revealed that compound 
1
had twenty-seven carbons, including a ketal moiety at 
δC
109.4 (C-22), two olefinic carbons at 
δC
145.6 (C-5) and 122.2 (C-6), and four methyl carbons at 
δ
C
17.0 (C-18), 17.1 (C-19), 15.5 (C-21) and 17.7 (C-27). Comparison of the 1D NMR data with those of bufospirostenin A, which was obtained from the toad

            <tp:taxon-name>
gargarizans (
Tian et al., 2017
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, indicated that 
1
had the same substructure in rings A-E (including the rearranged A and B rings), but in the F ring of 
1
the Δ 
25,27
double bond was replaced with C-27 methyl. The assignment of 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data (
Table 1
) combined with the extensive analysis of 
1
H– 
1
H COSY and HSQC spectra further suggested that compound 
1
was a rearranged isospirostanol. The rearranged skeleton (rings A and B) was further confirmed by the 
1
H– 
1
H COSY and HMBC spectra (
Fig. 2
). The 
1
H– 
1
H COSY spectrum showed proton interactions of H-1/H 
2
-2, H 
2
-2/H-3, H-3/H 
2
-4, H-6/H 
2
-7, and H 
2
-7/H-8. HMBC correlations between H 
2
-4/C-5, H 
2
-4/C-6, H-2β/C-10, H-2α/C-5, H 
3
-19/C-1 and H 
3
-19/C-9 established the 5/7 ring system connected through the C-1 to C-5 bond. Additionally, the HMBC correlations between H-7/C-8, H-7/C-9, H-8/C-11, and H-9/C-11 revealed that rings B and C were connected 
via
the C-8 to C-9 bond. The relative configuration of 
1
was established based on NOESY correlations (
Fig. 3
), 
13
C NMR data, and 
3
J
H, H
coupling values. The NOESY correlations between H-1/H-3 
α
and H-1/H-9 suggested that these protons were cofacial. In addition, the NOESY correlations between H-8/H 
3
-19, H-8/H 
3
-18, H-20/H 
3
-18 and H-14/H-16 identified the 
trans -trans
ring junction for rings B/C and C/D, and 
β
-orientation for H-20. The 
R
configuration of C-25 was confirmed by the downfield shift of C-23, C-24, C-25, and C-26 from 25–28 to 29–30 ppm (

). Furthermore, the characteristic chemical shift of H-26 [
δ
3.49 (1H, t, 
J
= 10.3 Hz, H-26a) and 
δ
3.58 (1H, m, H-26b), Δ 
δ
ab
&lt;
0.48 ppm] also supported the assignment of the C-25 
R
configuration (

). Accordingly, the structure of 
1
was established to be ophiopogonol A, as shown in 
Fig. 1
.

Ophiopogonol B (

), white needle crystals (MeOH), HRESIMS indicated a pseudo-molecular ion at m/z 429.3017 [M-H] 
-
(calcd. 429.3005 for C 
27
H

4
) and showed the same molecular formula (C 
27
H 
42
O 
4
) as that of compound 
1
. The 
13
C NMR spectroscopic data of 
2
displayed a total of twenty-seven carbon signals, including two olefinic carbons at 
δ
C
145.7 (C-5) and 122.4 (C-6), and a ketal carbon signal at 
δC
108.9 (C-22). The 
1
H NMR spectrum showed presence of one olefinic proton at 
δC
5.68 (1H, brs, H-6) and four methyl proton groups at 
δ
H
0.70 (3H, d, 
J
= 5.4 Hz, H 
3
-27), 1.08 (3H, s, H 
3
-18), 1.13 (3H, d, 
J
= 7.9 Hz, H 
3
-21), and 1.35 (3H, s, H 
3
-19). By comparing the 1D and 2D NMR spectra (
Table 1
), it was found that compound 
2
corresponded well with compound 
1
, apart from significant differences in signals attributable to the E ring. Based on 
1
H– 
1
H COSY and HMBC correlations (
Fig. 2
), compound 
2
was determined to have the same planar structure as that of 
1
. NOESY correlations (
Fig. 3
) of H 
3
-19/H-8, H-8/H-13 and H-14/H-16 indicated the 
trans -trans
ring junction of rings B, C and D. However, the 
α
-configuration of H-20 indicated by both the NOESY correlations of H-16 
/
H-20, H-20 
/
H-23 
α
and the chemical shift values at 
δC
47.3 (C-20), 12.0 (C-21), 61.4 (C-17), and 108.9 (C-22) was distinctly different from that in 
1
. This change in the configuration of H-20 was also supported by the fact that the chemical shift of H-20 at a lower field than 
δ
2.47 indicates a 
cis
configuration for the proton and the oxygen atom in the F ring (

). The absolute configuration of C-25 of 
2
was established to be 
R
based on the chemical shifts of C-23, C-24, C-25, C-26 and H-26 [
δ
3.62 (2H, m, H 
2
-26)] in pyridine- 
d
5
(

; 

). Therefore, compound 
2
was determined to be an epimer of 
1
.

3
possessed a Δ 
5,6
-spirostanol skeleton with a –OH group at C-3, C-12, C-14, and C-17. Analysis of the 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra demonstrated that compound 
3
was in good agreement with the aglycone moiety of ophiopogonin R (

), except for discrepancies in carbon signals caused by glycosylation, whereby downfield shifts of 2.9 ppm for C-2 (
δ
C
33.1) and 5 ppm for C-3 (
δ
C
44.0), and an upfield shift of 6.1 ppm for C-4 (
δ
C
44.0), were observed in 

3
in

comparison to ophiopogonin R. The aforementioned deduction was confirmed by the 
1
H–

In compounds 
1
and 
2
, the A/B ring system was rearranged with a [5- 7-6-5-5-6] hexacyclic skeleton rather than the usual decalin system. The only reported spirostanol with the 5/7 system in A-B rings (bufospirostenin A) was found in the toad 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bufo bufo
gargarizans
</tp:taxon-name>
; no spirostanols with the 5/7 system in A-B rings have been reported in plants (

). The 5/7 ring fragment is widely found in macrocyclic diterpenoids of the family 
<tp:taxon-name>
Euphorbiaceae (
Zhang et al., 2018
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. By investigating the biosynthetic route of bufogargarizins A and B (

) and macrocyclic diterpenoids with the 5/7 ring fragment, it was found that the ring-opening behavior of two six-membered rings to form a twelve-membered system is an essential step for the formation of the 5/7 bicyclic skeleton (
Fig. 4 A and 4 B
) (

). In addition, most of the previously reported steroidal saponins in 
<tp:taxon-name>O. japonicus</tp:taxon-name>
are polyhydroxy in the aglycone moiety (

). It is postulated that hydroxyl groups at C-1 and C-5 are key factors that initiate the ring-opening process, and thereby the formation of the 5/7 ring fragment in 
1
and 
2
(
Fig. 4 C
). Therefore, a plausible biosynthetic pathway for ophiopogonol A (
1
) and ophiopogonol B (
2
) was deduced (
Fig. 4
). Under certain conditions, the 6-hydroxyl group is oxidized to a ketone group. After the oxygen atom of 1-hydroxyl group attacks the relatively electron-deficient carbon atom at 10-position (β- position of 6-ketone), ethylene oxide and enol intermediates are formed. The carbanion in the enol moiety then performs a nucleophilic attack on the C-1 atom, which has lower steric hindrance, and opens the ring of ethylene oxide to furnish the target compound through reduction and dehydration.
</p>
         <p>
All isolated steroidal saponins were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect on human large cell lung carcinoma cells (NCI–H460). Cisplatin served as the positive control (11.6 ± 0.7 μM). Cell viability was assessed using MTT assay. Sprengerinin C (
19)
showed significant inhibitory ability with an IC 
50
value of 2.1 ± 0.8 μM (
Table 3
and 
Fig. 5 A
). The spindle-like cell morphology of NCI–H460 cells could be distinguished at a concentration of 1.0 μM (1/2 IC 
50
), and NCI–H460 cells shriveled and vanished completely at 4.0 μM (2 times IC 
50
) (
Fig. 5B
). Additionally, an AnnexinV-FITC/PI staining was utilized to detect the apoptosis ratio of NCI–H460 cells following exposure to sprengerinin C (
19
). The percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly increased 48 h after sprengerinin C (
19
) treatment (apoptotic rates of 11.68%, 16.68%, and 74.90% induced by 1.0 μM, 2.0 μM, and 4.0 μM sprengerinin C, respectively) compared to that of the control group (7.73%) (
Fig. 6 A and 6 B
). Hoechst staining experiments revealed a similar result, showing that sprengerinin C (
19
) (1.0 μM, 2.0 μM, and 4.0 μM) could induce apoptosis of NCI–H460 cells (
Fig. 6 C
). Flow cytometry analysis of the NCI–H460 cell cycle demonstrated that sprengerinin C (
19
) could induce apoptosis in NCI–H460 cells and arrest the cycle at the G2/M phase (
Fig. 7 A and 7 B
).

3. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
In summary, a chemical study of the rhizomes of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ophiopogon japonicus
</tp:taxon-name>
revealed four undescribed steroidal saponins (
1–4
), including the first example of steroids (
1
and 
2
) with a rearranged A/B ring system from plants, and nineteen known steroidal glycosides (
5–23
). The biogenetic pathway of unusual steroids 
1
and 
2
was postulated based on bimolecular nucleophilic substitution. According to the traditional uses and new application as a treatment for lung diseases, all the isolates were tested for their cytotoxic effects against the NCI–H460 cell line, and sprengerinin C (
19
) exhibited a stronger cytotoxic effect than the positive drug cisplatin.

Cell viability of NCI–H460 cells was estimated using the MTT assay (

) and cell morphological methods (

). For the MTT assay, NCI–H460 cells were plated in 96-well microplates. The NCI–H460 cells were attached to the wall after 24 h, after which the incubation buffer was removed. The isolated compounds were added to the cells at concentrations of 10.0 μM, 50.0 μM, and 100.0 μM, and then cells were incubated for 48 h. The absorbance of the samples was measured spectrophotometrically at 
490 nm

C. The cells were then treated with or without sprengerinin C (
19
) for 48 h, harvested, and attached. At the appointed times, floating cells were collected, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffer saline (PBS), and distributed in 200.0 μL binding buffer. The cells were then cultured with Annexin V/PI at 25
