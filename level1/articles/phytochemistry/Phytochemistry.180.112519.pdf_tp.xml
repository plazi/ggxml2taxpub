The reaction mechanism of the intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition from a jatrophane precursor to the gaditanane skeleton, an unprecedented 5/6/4/6-fused tetracyclic ring framework recently isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>Euphorbia spp.</tp:taxon-name>
, was studied using the bond reactivity indices approach. Furthermore, six diterpenoids, including three undescribed jatrophanes isolated from

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Euphorbia
</tp:taxon-name>
has attracted a great attention in the search for natural-product-based drugs as an abundant source of bioactive terpenoids (

; 

; 

; 

; 

; Zhao et al., 2018). With over 2000 known species is the largest genus in the plant family 
<tp:taxon-name>
Euphorbiaceae (
Jassbi, 2006
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, and no less than 400 diterpenoids isolated from plants of that genus exhibit relevant biological activities (

; 

; 

; 

). Many plants species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Euphorbiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family produce diterpenoids with jatrophane, lathyrane, tigliane, daphnane, ingenane, or myrsinane skeleta which show a broad range of interesting pharmacological properties such as antitumor and multidrug resistance reversing activities (

, 

; 

; 

; 

; Wang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019). The ability of members of these classes of compounds to modulate protein kinase C (PKCs) (Dur´an-Pe˜na et al., 2014) is associated with a wide variety of biological activities such as cell differentiation (Weinstein et al., 1979; 

), skin inflammation (

), tumor promotion (

; 

), cytotoxicity (

), latent HIV-1 reactivation (

; 

; 

; Marquez´et al., 2008; 

), and recently in neural precursor proliferation (Castro-Gonz´alez et al., 2013, 2015; 

; Flores-Giubi et al., 2019).
</p>
         <p>
Among 
<tp:taxon-name>Euphorbiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family diterpenes, jatrophane diterpenoids are ubiquitous metabolites of genera 
<tp:taxon-name>
Euphorbia
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Jatropha
(
Sabandar et al., 2013
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. The general structure of the jatrophane skeleton is characterized by a 5/12 fused-ring system and they are usually substituted by a variety of acyl groups to 
<tp:taxon-name>
form polyesters (
Fattahian et al., 2020
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. Interestingly, it has been described that some jatrophane diterpenoids have anti-cancer activity (

; 

), as well as microtubule interacting activity (

) and act 
in vitro
against HIV-1 (

) and CHIKV viruses (

; 

); furthermore, they are considered among the most potent modulators of P-glycoproteins that reverse multidrug resistance (

; 

; 

; 

; 

).

Euphorbia gaditana
Coss.
</tp:taxon-name>
, belonging to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Euphorbia
</tp:taxon-name>
, is an endangered species from Southern Spain (western Andalusia) and Northern Africa (
Algeria
and 
Tunisia
). In a previous chemical investigation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. gaditana
Coss
</tp:taxon-name>
, a previously undescribed jatrophane (
1
) together with an undescribed diterpenoid (
2
) with an unprecedented 5/ 6/4/6-fused tetracyclic ring skeleton, were isolated from the aerial parts of this plant. The name gaditanane was proposed for that carbon skeleton. A suggested biosynthetic relationship between both compounds was also established by chemical correlation (

). Simultaneously, in a report from 

, two other undescribed jatrophane-derived diterpenoid esters with a 5/6/4/6-fused tetracyclic ring skeleton, heliosterpenoids A and B, were isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. helioscopia
</tp:taxon-name>
and were found to be potent inhibitors of 
β
-glycoproteins and exhibited cytotoxic activity.
</p>
         <p>
Therefore, as a part of our ongoing research on the identification and study of the reactivity of undescribed bioactive compounds potentially capable of modulating PKC isoforms (

; Flores-Giubi et al., 2019), a detailed study of the specialised metabolites in the roots and aerial parts of 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. gaditana
Coss
</tp:taxon-name>
has been conducted. A study of the cyclization to gaditanone from jathrophane metabolites isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. gaditana
Coss
</tp:taxon-name>
, has been modeled using bond reactivity indices approach.

2.1. Isolation and chemical characterization
</title>
         <p>
The petroleum ether and dichloromethane extracts from the aerial parts and roots of 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. gaditana
Coss
</tp:taxon-name>
were further purified leading to the isolation and structural elucidation of three undescribed jatrophanes (
3–5
), along with the three previously known compounds (
1
, 
2
and 
6
) (
Fig. 1
). The structures of compounds 
3–5
were established based on spectroscopy analysis including 1D and 2D NMR and HRESIMS experiments. Absolute configuration for compound 
3
was established by comparison among its experimental and calculated ECD, where the starting point conformation used for computational calculations was deduced from NOESY data. This, in turn, supported the proposed absolute configurations given for compounds 
4–5
.
</p>
         <p>
Analysis of the NMR data showed that 
3–5
are closely related structurally to other jatrophane-skeleton diterpenoids with acyloxy groups previously described in the literature from 
<tp:taxon-name>

Compound 
3
was isolated as an amorphous solid, and its molecular formula C 
33
H 
44
O 
10
(12 unsaturations) was deduced on the basis of the observed sodium adduct ion in its HRESIMS (
m/z
623.2834 [M+Na] 
+
). Both 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data analysis (
Table 1
) revealed four ester residues attributable to the presence of three acetoxy groups and one benzoyloxy group. In addition of these signals, 
13
C NMR and DEPT spectra displayed signals for the remaining 20 skeletal carbons, encompassing five methyl groups, one methylene group, 11 methine groups (including five oxygenated sp 
3
carbons and three olefinic carbons), and three nonprotonated carbons (including one oxygenated sp 
3
carbon and one olefinic carbon).
</p>
         <p>
The HMBC cross-peaks from H-8 (
δ
H
5.34 ppm) and H-14 (
δ
H
4.79 ppm) to 
δ
C
169.2 and 170.4 ppm, respectively, indicated two acetoxy groups attached to C-8 and C-14 whereas the benzoate chain was located at C-9 due to HMBC cross-peaks from H-9 (
δ
H
4.60 ppm) to carbonyl carbon of the benzoyl group at 
δ
C
167.4 ppm. The remaining acetoxy group could not be directly attached by HMBC experiments due to the lack of direct correlations. The comparison of the chemical shifts and coupling constants of H-3 and H-2 with those observed in the literature for other related jatrophanes pointed out that it must be located at C-3 (

, 

; 

; 

; 

). Finally, the free hydroxyl groups were deduced to be attached to C-7 and C-15. The gCOSY correlations observed for protons H-7 (
δ
H
4.16 ppm) and OH-7 (
δ
H
4.85 ppm) indicated the presence of a hydroxyl group at C-7. The remaining one hydroxyl group must be located at C-15 due to the shielding of that nucleus in the 
13
C NMR spectrum in comparison to other related-jatrophanes (Table S9) (
Fig. 2
) (

, 

; 

; 

; 

). A new signal at 
δ
H
7.27 ppm in the 
1
H NMR spectrum in C 
6
D 
6
, which partially exchanged with D 
2
O, confirmed the hydroxyl group at C-15 (Table S8 and Fig. S14).
</p>
         <p>
The relative configuration of 
3
was deduced by the interpretation of the NOESY spectrum. The correlations of H-4/H 
3
-17/H-7/H-8 and H-4/ H-13/H-11 indicated α- orientations for those protons, whereas the correlations of H-5/H-9 were used to place these protons on the opposite face of the macrocycle. The NOESY correlations of H-11/H 
3
-17/H-13 and the coupling constant of 
J
11,12
= 15.5 Hz revealed the 
E
-geometry of the C-11/C-12 double bond, while the 
E
stereochemistry of the C-5/C-6 olefin linkage was deduced from NOESY correlations between H-4/H 
3
- 17 and H-5/H-9. Further NOESY correlations of H 
3
-16/H-3/H-4 and H-12/H 
3
-20/H-14 revealed their proximity in space (
Fig. 3
). Moreover, the coupling constant 
J
14,13
= 10.3 Hz (
Table 1
) was compatible with an anti-disposition of H-13 and H-14 and it was in agreement with the values described in literature for other related-jatrophanes (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
On the basis of the α- assumed configuration of H-4 and 
β
-orientation of 15-OH, characteristic of all jatrophane-type diterpene derivatives isolated to date (

; 

), and NOESY correlations the absolute configuration for 
3
was suggested to be assigned as 2 
R
,3 
S
,4 
S
,7 
S
,8 
S
,9 
S
,13 
S
,14 
R
,15 
R
. This absolute configuration of 
3
was supported by comparison of the experimental ECD spectrum with the computed ECD spectrum calculated from quantum mechanical time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations with B3LYP/6-31G++ (d,p) level of theory, using the Gaussian 16 program (

). The theoretically calculated ECD spectrum of 
3
was in good agreement with the experimental ECD spectrum (
Fig. 4
).
</p>
         <p>
Compounds 
4
and 
5
showed the same molecular formula of C 
35
H 
46
O 
11
based on a sodium adduct ion at 
m/z
= 665.2946 [M+Na] 
+
and 
m/z
= 665.2944 [M+Na] 
+
, respectively in their HRESIMS spectra. Both the 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data (
Table 1
) indicated that the structure of compounds 
4
and 
5
closely resembled jatrophane 
3
, the difference being the presence and position of an additional acetoxy group.
</p>
         <p>
In contrast to 
3
, an acetyl group in compound 
4
is located at C-7, which was confirmed by the HMBC cross-peak between H-7 (
δ
H
5.09 ppm) and 
δ
C
170.0 ppm. The gCOSY spectrum enabled assignment of the free hydroxy group as attached to C-8 due to the correlations observed for protons H-8 (
δ
H
3.91 ppm) and OH-8 (
δ
H
3.02 ppm). Finally, the remaining one acetoxy group could only be located at C-15. The NOESY correlation of H-14/H-13, H-4/H-13/H-11, H-4/H 
3
-17/H-7/H-8 and H-8/H 
3
-18 confirmed that the 14-OAc group was 
β
-oriented. Furthermore, the NOESY cross-peaks of H-9/H 
3
-19, H 
3
-19/H-12 and H-12/H 
3
-20 revealed 
β
-orientations. According to the above evidences, the biogenetically consistency for an α- orientation of H-4 of a large variety of known jatrophanes (

), and above described ECD data for related compound 
3
, the absolute configuration of compound

The gCOSY correlation between H-7 (
δ
H
4.10 ppm) and OH-7 (
δ
H
3.97 ppm) in compound 
5
confirmed the presence of a hydroxyl group at C-7. Thus, the acetoxy groups were attached at C-3, C-8, C-14 and C-15. Furthermore, 
1
H NMR data revealed evident differences in comparison to compounds 
3
and 
4
, with a slightly deshielded for H-3 (
δ
H
5.18 ppm in compound 
5
vs 
δ
H
4.38 ppm and 
δ
H
4.62 ppm in compounds 
3
and 
4
, respectively). Steric interactions existing between protons and their neighbouring groups would result in a van-der-Waals effect that might lead to the deshielding of the protons (

). Furthermore, it was observed a similar chemical shift for the signals H-1α and H-1 
β
in compound 
5
(
δ
H
2.46 ppm for H-1α and 
δ
H
2.31 ppm for H-1

) whereas protons H-1 
β
are deshielded and protons H-1α shielded in compounds 
3
and

; 
δ
H
1.34 ppm for H-1α and 
δ

in compound

). These features pointed out a different configuration at C-2 position in compound 
5
, which was also supported by the smaller 
J
4,3
(4.6 Hz) in comparison to compounds 
3
and 
4
(
J
4,3
= 9.2 Hz). The NOESY cross-peaks of H-2/H-3, H-3/H-4, H-4/H-13 and H-13/H-14 suggested the α- orientation of H-2, H-3, H-13 and H-14. Furthermore, the NOESY cross-peaks of H-7/H-8 indicated that these protons were also co-facial with α- orientations whereas the NOESY cross-peaks of H-9/H 
3
-19 and H 
3
-19/H

-20 revealed 
β
-orientations. Thus, based on the above described evidence and on similar grounds than those presented for compound

2.2. Biosynthetic study of the intramolecular [2
+ 
2] cycloaddition
</title>
         <p>
The isolation of 
6
, the proposed biosynthetic precursor for gaditanone (
2
), from 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. gaditana
Coss
</tp:taxon-name>
encouraged us to gain insight on the nature of the intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition leading to the gaditanane skeleton by computational analysis. Two possible biosynthetic routes were hypothesized (
Fig. 7
). On the one hand, the jatrophane ester 
1
might undergo cyclization following the pathway 
A
to obtain a tetra-fused derivative (
7
) that could be further oxidized to 
<tp:taxon-name>form gaditanone</tp:taxon-name>
(
2
). On the other hand, a previous oxidation of 
1
leading to 
6
would be a required step, previous to its cyclization to yield gaditanone (
2
) (pathway 
B
).
</p>
         <p>
In a cycloaddition reaction there is an electron density transfer from the nucleophilic to the electrophilic species (

; 

). In order to translate this concept into a computational analysis, a recent methodology has been used for obtaining bond reactivity indices (Δ 
f
i
NBO

) (S´anchez-M´arquez, 2016; 2018; 

) and philicities for every Natural Bond Orbital (NBO). These bond reactivity indices are obtained through projection of the function dual descriptor on the localized orbitals obtained in the NBO analysis allowing the reaction site of an electrophile or nucleophile to be determined within a much-localized molecular region. A negative small value of Δ 
f
i
NBO

together with a high partial occupancy indicates a nucleophilic behaviour whereas a positive value of Δ 
f
i
NBO

and a small partial occupancy corresponds to an electrophilic behaviour. For instance, this approach has been successfully applied to study previously the regioselectivity in Diels-Alder reactions (

). In addition, in this study, a Second-Order Perturbational Theory Analysis (SOPTA) (

) has been also used to complement and corroborate the results. To the best of our knowledge, these quantum methodologies have not been previously applied in clarifying biosynthetic pathways of terpenes.
</p>
         <p>
Firstly, the pathway 
A
proposed in 
Fig. 7
was studied considering a singlet state in a concerted mechanism. Therefore, in compound 
1
the π bonding orbitals 167 (C11–C12), 
§
168 (C5–C6) and the π anti-bonding orbitals 181 (C11–C12) and 182 (C5–C6) would be responsible for the formation of the four-membered ring (Table S3, Supporting information; Jatrophane numbering has been used for describing the orbital interactions throughout the manuscript. For correspondence between jatrophane and gaussian numbering used in table S3, see Table S2 of Supporting Information). However, a [2 + 2] cycloaddition it does not seem to be very favoured in that model, since the virtual orbitals 181 and 182 have little electrophilic character (Δ 
f
i
NBO

0.054 and 0.058, respectively). Furthermore, they have very high orbital energy and according to the geometry that the model predicts, they are a long way from the occupied orbitals to interact with them (Table S3, Supporting information). As in the previous case, in an alternative non-concerted mechanism through triplet state, the formation of the carbocycle would occur by the interaction of the π bonding orbitals 170 (C5–C6), 
§
171 (C11–C12) and the π anti-bonding orbitals 181 (C5–C6) and 182 (C11–C12) (Table S4, Supporting information; For correspondence between jatrophane and gaussian numbering used in table S4, see Table S2 of Supporting Information). The NBO 170 transfers its electronic charge to the NBO 181 whereas the NBO 171 transfers to NBO 182. In contrast to the triplet state concerted mechanism, the π bonding NBOS 170 (C5–C6) and 171 (C11–C12) showed lesser nucleophilic character (Δ 
f
i
NBO

0.126 and 0.222, respectively) and the π anti 
-
bonding NBOs 181 (C5–C6) and 182 (C11–C12) showed a decrease in the electrophilic character (Δ 
f
i
NBO

0.028 and 0.054, respectively). Moreover, the unpaired electrons according to the model appeared in the benzoyl moiety (
Fig. S5
, Supporting Information). Consequently, neither the singlet state concerted, nor the triplet state non-concerted mechanisms seem to be favoured making pathway A an unlikely alternative. In order to verify these results, compound 
1
was treated with a catalytic amount of benzophenone under UV light (

) and it did not undergo [2 + 2] cycloaddition.
</p>
         <p>
On the other hand, it was carried out orbital energy diagrams of the singlet and triplet states of compound 
6
(
Fig. 7
, Pathway B). In the singlet state, NBO 182 (C5–C6) 
§
showed a high electrophilic character (see Δ 
f
i
NBO

in Table S6, Supporting Information). However, NBO 181 (C11–C12) showed a much less electrophilic character, with Δ 
f
i
NBO

values below NBOs 172 and 176 respectively located on carbonyl group at C-7 and on carbonyl of benzoate substituent at C-9. Furthermore, NBOs 161 (C11–C12) and 162 (C5–C6) 
§
are highly stabilized since they are located below the occupied NBOs 
163–171 in
the orbital diagram, disfavouring the orbital interactions (Table S6, Supporting Information; For correspondence between jatrophane and gaussian numbering used in table S6, see Table S5 of Supporting Information). If a non-concerted mechanism is considered, two new lone pairs 
type
orbitals appeared in C-5 (NBO 172) and in the oxygen of the carbonyl group at C-7 (NBO 163), and a new double bond C6–C7 (NBO 160) is formed (Table S7, supporting information). The proposed resonance structures of unpaired electrons in the triple state are shown in 
Fig. 8
. The comparison of the resonance structures with the orbital diagram for this state showed a full correspondence of structure 
II
with the new orbitals (see 
Fig. S7
) described for the triplet-state (Table S7, Supporting Information; For correspondence between jatrophane and gaussian numbering used in table S7, see Table S5 of Supporting Information).
</p>
         <p>
The Δ 
f
i
NBO

values (Table S7, supporting information) indicated that the radical electron NBO 172 (C5) 
§
(Δ 
f
i
NBO

0.386) has the highest nucleophilic character and the second radical electron is found in orbital 163 (C7–CO) 
§
(Δ 
f
i
NBO

0.042) that has a slight nucleophilic character. On the other hand, the π bonding NBO 160 (C6–C7) 
§
showed the highest electrophilic character (Δ 
f
i
NBO

0.295). This information indicates that C5 is very nucleophilic and C6 very electrophilic (
Fig. S7
, Supporting Information). For this reason, the interaction with the occupied orbital 162 (C11–C12) and the virtual orbital 182 (C11–C12) 
§
would give rise to the C5–C11 and C12–C6 bonds in gaditanone (
2
). These interactions were corroborated in the SOPTA study, which showed two important interactions. The first one between the NBO 163 (C7–CO) 
§
and the π anti-bonding NBO 173 (C6–C7) 
§
with a value for energy of 8.19 kcal/mol, and a second interaction of NBO 163 (C7–CO) 
§
with the anti-bonding NBO 194 (C7–C8) 
§
with energy equal to 9.99 kcal/mol. These interactions would stabilize by delocalization the structures shown in 
Fig. 8
.
</p>
         <p>In contrast to pathway A, the excitation from singlet to triplet seems to be determinant in the change of reactivity of the orbitals involved in the pathway B.</p>

3. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
The bond reactivity indices study suggests that the intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition leading to gaditanone (
2
) proceeds through a photochemical non-concerted mechanism of the enone 
6
. The stereoselectivity of the cycloaddition could be understood by the delocalization of electron density over specific NBOs presumably originated from the steric effects of the substituents in the transition state avoiding the 
cis
/ 
trans
isomerization (

). Furthermore, the formation of a cyclohexanone moiety in the 5/6/4/6-fused tetracyclic ring skeleton both in gaditanone (
2
) (

) and heliosterpenoids A and B (

) seems to play a structural stabilization role, favouring the cyclization of the jatrophane precursors.

Conformational analysis of

The energies, oscillator strengths, and rotational strengths of the first 20 electronic excitations were calculated using a TD-DFT-B3LYP/6-31G++ (d,p) level of theory. The ECD spectrum of the conformer was simulated using a Gaussian function with a half-bandwidth of 0.33 eV. The corresponding theoretical ECD spectrum of the enantiomer (

-3

) was depicted by inverting that of 
3
. All quantum computations were performed using Gaussian 16 program package (

), on a high performance computer located at CICA (Centro Inform´atico Científico de

200–400 nm
region, the theoretically calculated ECD spectrum of 
3
was in good agreement with the experimental ECD spectrum (
