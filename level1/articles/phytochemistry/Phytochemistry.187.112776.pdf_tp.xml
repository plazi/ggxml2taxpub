38063 was conducted to generate various derivatives for the development of bioactive compounds. Four previously undescribed compounds along with six known compounds were obtained. The newly identified isolates were characterized using 1D and 2D NMR, IR, and HRESIMS, and three compounds were further confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analyses. Subsequently, the effects of 15-ene steviol and its derivatives on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine production by THP-1 cells were examined, with dexamethasone used as a positive control. Results indicated that most of the tested compounds showed lower inhibitory effects than those detected in the dexamethasone-treated group, except that 15-ene steviol showed better effects than dexamethasone on the reduction of LPS-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, 2, and 3 release. Three specialized products similarly showed better effects than dexamethasone on the inhibition of LPS-induced secretion of regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). Moreover, none of the tested compounds showed any cytotoxicity or triggered cell apoptosis, and none affected the protein integrity of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) or MyD88, suggesting that these compounds may exert the anti-inflammatory activity downstream of membrane-associated TLR4 and MyD88 molecules.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Stevioside, an 
ent
-kaurene diterpene glycoside, is a constituent of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Stevia rebaudiana
Bertoni (Asteraceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
(

). Hydrolysis of stevioside by dilute hydrochloric acid afforded isosteviol (
1
), 15-ene steviol (
ent
-13-hydroxy-kaur-15-en-19-oic acid) (
2
), and 
ent
-13, 16-dihydroxy-kauran-19-oic acid (
3
) (

). 15-Ene steviol (
2
) is an isomer of steviol (

; 

). Steviol (
ent
-13-hydroxy-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid), an aglycone of the natural sweetener stevioside, is obtained by incubating stevioside with various enzymes (

; 

). I t can also be prepared by chemical degradation of stevioside (

). The difference between structures of 
2
and steviol is the location of the double bond. The double bond in steviol is exocyclic at 
C-
16. On the contrary, the double bond in isomer 
2
is endocyclic at 
C-
15. Steviol exhibits many pharmacological activities including inhibition of glucose absorption (

), anti-hyperglycemic effect (

), anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities (

), and can reduce Madin-Darby canine kidney cyst formation and growth (

). However, the biological activity of 
2
has not yet been reported.

Microbial transformation is a biological synthesis process that uses enzymes inside microorganism as biocatalysts. The principal advantages are the environmental safety, mild conditions, and characteristic regio- and stereoselectivities of these biocatalytic processes (

). Thus, this technique permits access to remote positions on molecules and offers a useful alternative to chemical approaches (

).

Excessive and persistent production of cytokines and chemokines are involved in the pathogenesis of infections, allergies, and immune related diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, coronary artery disease, obesity, cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases (

; 

; 

; 

). Cytokines, a class of small cell-signaling proteins, are key modulators of inflammation participating in acute and chronic inflammation (

; 

; 

; 

). Interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-12, IL-18 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote inflammation (

). Chemokines, structurally related chemotactic cytokines, are a specific subclass of cytokines. Chemokines are categorized into four groups: 
C
– 
C
chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), monocyte inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES), C-X-C chemokines (IL-8 also called growth related oncogene or GRO/KC), 
C
chemokines (lymphotactin), and CX 
3
C
chemokines (

; 

; 

). They are produced during infections, or as a response to inflammatory stimuli, and facilitate immune response by targeting cells of the innate and adaptive immune system (

). Therefore, cytokines and chemokines play a pivotal role in the development, homeostasis, activation, differentiation, regulation, and functions of innate and adaptive immunity (

). Glucocorticoids (GCs), such as dexamethasone, have been known to suppress a plethora of pro-inflammatory genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, and other mediators, thereby interfering with the inflammatory response (

, 

; 

; 

). GCs have been used as therapeutic treatment in a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (

; 

). However, long-term systemic treatment of GCs remain as the cause of unsolved problems, such as the GC resistance or undesired side effects (

; 

). Inhibition of cytokines release can be an alternative therapeutic strategy for alleviating a variety of disorders (

). Thus, agents that modulate cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathways may be considered as an effective therapeutic strategy for preventing inflammatory reactions and diseases (

; 

).

A
great number of naturally occurring 
ent
-kaurane diterpenoids have been isolated from many plant families (

). They have also attracted interest because of their structures and wide range of biological activities (

; 

). According to the literature, tetracyclic diterpenoids possess rigid ring systems, and they have received special attention as substrates for microbial transformation to produce sizable amounts of new compounds otherwise difficult or impossible to synthesize by chemical methods (

; 

). Thus, the aim of this study was the microbial transformation of 
2
to obtain diverse compounds and characterize their new biological activities. Because tetracyclic diterpenoids possess steroid-like skeletons (

) and they are capable of inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines (

; Hueso-Falc´on et al., 2011; 

), the effects of all isolates on LPS-induced cytokine production by THP-1 cells were examined, with dexamethasone used as a positive control. Herein, we describe the production, isolation, and structural characterization of isolates as well as their effects on cytokine production. In addition, interactions of biotransformation products with the active site of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) were also analyzed through molecular docking.

During the acid hydrolysis of stevioside, 15-ene steviol (
2
) was isolated as a minor product by means of silica gel column chromatography. The structure of 
2
was characterized by 1D and 2D NMR, HRESIMS, and by comparison with the literature (

). Screening-scale studies were performed with 20 microbial cultures to determine their abilities to transform

. Among the different strains screened,

produced 
4
, 
9
,

, and 
12
(
Fig. 1
). Among these isolates, 
ent
-13, 16β- dihydroxy-kauran-19-oic acid (
3
), 
ent
-13-hydroxy-kaur-16--en-19-oic acid (
5
; steviol), 
ent
-13,15β- dihydroxy-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid (
10
) and 
ent
-13,17-dihydroxy-kaur-15-en-19-oic acid (
12
) have been described previously (

; 

; 

), while 
ent
-7α,13-dihydroxy-kaur-15-en-19-oic acid (
6
) and 
ent
-14β- hydroxy-16-oxo-beyeran-19-oic acid (
8
) were reported as their methyl esters, respectively (

; 

). Compound 
4
was obtained as white crystalline needles with IR absorption at 1272 (
C
–O– 
C
) and 1731 (
C
––O) cm 
1
. HRESIMS data of 
4
showed a protonated molecular ion at 
m/z
335.2229 [M +H] 
+
(calcd for 
C
20
H 
31
O 
4
, 335.2222). This implied that the molecular formula of 
4
was 
C
20
H 
30
O 
4
. The 
13
C
NMR spectrum displayed resonances for 20 carbons, while the DEPT spectrum showed the same carbon multiplicity as 
2
. However, comparison of the 
1
H and 
13
C
NMR spectra of 
4
and 
2
revealed that alkene 
C
–H resonance was absent from 
4
, and new resonances at 
δH
4.51 and 
δC
75.3 appeared (
Table 1
; 
Figs. S1
and S 
2
, Supplementary data). Inspection of the HSQC and HMBC spectra revealed that a new proton resonance at 
δH
4.51 showed connectivities with carbon resonances at δ 43.5 (
C-
8), 84.8 (
C-
13), and 85.2 (
C-
16). 
CH
3
-17 (
δH
1.60) showed connectivities with 
δC
57.4 (
C-
15), 84.8 (
C-
13), and 85.2 (
C-
16) (
Fig. 2
; 
Figs. S3 S
6
, Supplementary data). In the 
1
H– 
1
H COSY spectrum, 
δH
4.51 showed cross-peaks with the methylene group (H-12: 
δH
2.39, d, 
J
= 10.5 Hz; 
δH
2.47, m) (Figs. S9 and S10, Supplementary data). Thus, an oxygen bridge between 
C-
11 and 
C-
16 was confirmed. The α- orientation of H-11 was established by NOE correlation of δ 4.51 with 
CH
3
-20 (δ 1.20), H-9β (δ 1.62–1.64), H-1 (δ 1.74–1.80), and H-12 (δ 2.47) (
Fig. 3
; Figs. S7 and S8, Supplementary data). Moreover, an X-ray crystallographic experiment was used to confirm the structure of 
4
(
Fig. 4
). Thus, 
4
was characterized as 
ent
-13-hydroxy-11α,16α- epoxy-kauran-19-oic acid.
</p>
         <p>
Compound 
7
was obtained as white cubic crystals. Its HRESIMS indicated a protonated molecular ion at 
m/z
373.2007 [M +Na] 
+
(calcd for 
C
20
H 
30
O 
5
Na, 373.1991) and 
m/z
349.2026 [M H] (calcd for 
C
20
H 
29
O 
5
, 349.2015), suggesting a molecular formula of 
C
20
H 
30
O 
5
. The IR spectrum suggested the presence of two carbonyl absorption bands at 1707 and 
1735 cm
1
. The 
1
H and 
13
C
NMR spectra displayed one carboxylic carbonyl, one carbonyl group, and seven methylene, four methine, three methyl, and four quaternary carbons (Figs. S11 and S12, Supplementary data). Comparison of the 
1
H and 
13
C
NMR spectra of 
7
and 
2
revealed that the double bond was absent from 
7
and was replaced by a carbonyl group at δ 221.4 (
Table 1
). An NOE effect was observed between H-15α (δ 2.66) and 
CH
3
-20 (δ 1.11) (Fig. S18, Supplementary data), suggesting that 
7
might possess an 
ent
-beyerane skeleton as does isosteviol (
1
) (

). The DEPT and HSQC spectra, compared to those of 
1
(

; 

), displayed new resonances at 
δH
4.65 (
δC
71.4) and 4.24 (
δC
84.7), suggesting that 
7
was a dihydroxylated product of 
1
(
Table 1
; Figs. S12 S14, Supplementary data). In the HMBC spectrum (
Fig. 2
; Figs. S15 and S16, Supplementary data), 
δH
4.65 exhibited cross-peaks with resonances at 
δC
44.8 (
C-
15), 47.7 (
C-
5), and 49.9 (
C-
9). Thus, hydroxylation had occurred at 
C-
7. In addition, the second new proton resonance at δ 4.24 showed correlations with resonances at 
δC
36.3 (
C-
12), 49.9 (
C-
9), and 44.8 (
C-
15), indicating the presence of one OH group at 
C-
14. In the NOESY spectrum, 7-OH was assigned a β- orientation due to the presence of cross-peaks of H-7 with H-6 (δ 2.42), H-15 (δ 2.47), and H-6 (δ 2.54–2.56). 14α- OH was established from cross-peaks of H-14 with 
CH
3
-17 (δ 1.38), H-12 (δ 1.47–1.53), and H-9β (δ 1.97) in the NOESY spectrum (
Fig. 3
; Figs. S17 and S18, Supplementary data). Furthermore, the structure of 
7
was confirmed by a single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis (
Fig. 4
). Thus, 
7
was characterized as 
ent
-7α, 14β- dihydroxy-16-oxo-beyeran-19-oic acid.

Compound 
9
showed a molecular formula of 
C
20
H 
30
O 
4
by HRESIMS data ([M + Na] 
+
at 
m/z
357.2030 and [M H] at 333.2057). The 
1
H and 
13
C
NMR spectra showed similar resonances as those of 
2
. However, the DEPT spectra revealed the disappearance of one tertiary carbon and the presence of one quaternary carbon resonating at δ 75.7 when compared with 
2
(
Table 1
; Figs. S21 and S22, Supplementary data). Thus, the lack of a carbinol-methine signal and the disappearance of one tertiary carbon in the 
1
H NMR and DEPT spectra of 
9
suggested that the new hydroxyl group was introduced at 
C-
5 or 
C-
9. In the 
13
C
NMR spectrum, 
C-
11 was shifted from δ 22.0 in 
2
to δ 
33.4 in
9
. 
CH
3
-20 was also significantly shifted downfield to 
δC
18.0 (Δδ + 1.7 ppm) and 
δH
1.47 (Δδ + 0.23 ppm) in the NMR spectra vs. 
2
, suggesting that a hydroxyl group might reside at 
C-
9 (
Table 1
). In the HSQC and HMBC spectra, 
CH
3
-20 (δ 1.47), H-7 (δ 1.57), H-11 (δ 1.77), H-12 (δ 2.01), H-11 (δ 2.34), and H-14 (δ 2.83) showed connectivities with 
δC
75.7, suggesting the presence of an OH group at 
C-
9 (
Fig. 2
; Figs. S23 S26, Supplementary data). On the basis of the above analysis, 
9
was established as 
ent
-9α,13-dihydroxy-kaur-15-en-19-oic acid.

         <p>
Compound 
11
was obtained as white needles, and its molecular formula, 
C

H 
30
O

, was established from HRESIMS data (
m/z
335.2229 [M +H] 
+
, calcd 335.2222) and the 
13
C
NMR and DEPT spectra. The 
1
H, 
13
C
NMR, and HSQC spectra were similar to those of 
2
except for new resonances at 
δH
4.74 and 
δC
71.1 (
Table 1
; Figs. S31 S34, Supplementary data). In the HMBC spectrum, the new resonance at 
δH
4.74 showed connectivities with resonances at 
δC
25.9 (
CH
3
-18), 35.6 (H-1), and 49.4 (H-5), indicating the presence of an OH group at 
C-
3 (
Fig. 2
; Figs. S35 and S36, Supplementary data). The β- orientation of 3-OH was suggested from cross-peaks of 
δH
4.74 (H-3) with resonances at 
δH
1.76 (
CH
3
-18), 2.01 (H-2), and 2.76 (H-2) (
Fig. 3
; Figs. S37 and S38, Supplementary data). Moreover, the single-crystal X-ray crystallographic experiment confirmed that 
11
was 
ent
-3α,13-dihydroxy-kaur-15-en-19- oic acid (
Fig. 4

2.2. Biological evaluation
</title>
         <p>
Boonkaewwan et al. reported that stevioside suppresses LPS-evoked tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β release, which is probably in part via the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/IKKβ/nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway (

). Because 15-ene steviol (
2
) is derived from stevioside, we analyzed the bioactivity of 
2
and its bioconverted derivatives in LPS-stimulated cytokine release by THP-1 cells, using dexamethasone as a positive control. After 24 h of treatment, dexamethasone significantly reduced TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β mRNA levels as analyzed by an RT-qPCR. Stevioside also decreased LPS-evoked IL-6 and IL-1β expression. Compounds 
3
and 
9
significantly reduced both TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA levels; whereas 
2
, 
4
, 
10
, and 
12
only decreased IL-6 expression. Overall, these compounds were less active than dexamethasone (
Table S1
, Supplementary data). Next, culture medium was collected and subjected to a human cytokine array to assess the effects of the tested compounds on LPS-induced cytokine secretion. After quantification and normalization to the LPS-treated group, the results showed that dexamethasone completely abolished LPS-induced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release, and reduced secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22) to approximately 60% levels. Dexamethasone also decreased the secretion of RANTES/CCL5 and TNF-α to about 70% levels (
Fig. 5
). However, stevioside only suppressed LPS-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-3 (CCL7), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF), and MDC secretion to about 50% levels (
Fig. 5
). Most of the tested compounds showed lower inhibitory effect than those detected in the dexamethasone-treated group. However, compound 
2
seemed to have better effect than dexamethasone on reducing LPS-induced MCP-1 (CCL2), 2 (CCL8), and 3 (CCL7) secretion; compounds 
10–12
showed similar and better inhibitory effect on LPS-induced RANTES secretion compared to dexamethasone (
Fig. 5
). Although the cytokine secretion profile was not fully comparable to the mRNA expression profile as shown by the RT-qPCR analysis, this could be because some cytokines were produced by proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound precursors or some might have been stored in traffic vesicles ready for release upon stimulation. In the present study, we analyzed cytokine mRNAs and cytokines released at 24 h after treatment; therefore, both cytokine mRNAs and secreted cytokines might not show parallel expression levels. In addition, all tested compounds at a 10 μM concentration did not show cytotoxicity toward 
100 ng
/mL LPS-treated THP-1 cells, as analyzed by an MTT assay (Fig. S41 

A
, Supplementary data). There was no apparent caspase-3 cleavage, further supporting that no cell damage or death occurred under the experimental conditions (Fig. S41 
B
, Supplementary data). Moreover, the integrity of TLR4 and its adaptor protein, MyD88, remained at similar levels (Fig. S41 
C
, Supplementary data), suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effect of these compounds might not interfere with signal reception, but possibly act through downstream TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway

2.3. Molecular docking studies
</title>
         <p>
In order to explore binding conformations of dexamethasone with compounds 
1–12
, molecular docking was performed with the docking program, CDOCKER algorithm, in Discovery Studio. CDOCKER energy represents interactions of ligand-protein complexes, and a lower interaction energy indicates higher stability. Dexamethasone, as a positive control, had the lowest interaction energy (60.00 kcal⋅mol 
1
). Among the tested compounds, 
11
and 
12
had lower interaction energies (49.59 and 50.54 kcal⋅mol 
1
, respectively), and 
10
had the highest interaction energy. Results of CDOCKER energy are tabulated in Table S2 (Supplementary data). Dexamethasone was reported to have higher affinity and greater bioavailability than natural hormones, such as cortisol (

). Its hydrogen bonds and alkyl interactions with key residues in the binding pocket of GR were studied, such as hydrogen bonds of Asn564, Arg611, Gln642, and Thr739 (

). Based on CDOCKER interaction energies, compounds 
2
and 
10–12
showed differences in their interaction energies according to the molecular docking. Compound 
10
was identified as having three hydrogen bonds, but exhibited no interaction with key residues of GR except for an alkyl interaction, while compounds 
11
and 
12
had more than one key residual interaction bound to the GR similar to what dexamethasone had. Although no compounds showed stronger and more stable interactions with the GR than dexamethasone, the docking results clearly showed their potential and ranking in ability to activate the GR. This result provides preliminary information of 15-ene steviol (
2
)-derived compounds bound to the GR and initial cascade signaling. Binding modes of dexamethasone, 
2
, and 
10–12
with the GR are depicted in 
Fig. 6.

         <p>
The three microbial strains selected for this study were able to hydroxylate 
2

<tp:taxon-name>
M. isabellina
</tp:taxon-name>
was able to hydroxylate 
2
at 
C-
3, -9, and -17. The formation of compound

by 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. 
niger
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. isabellina
</tp:taxon-name>
might have occurred in the same manner as in a previous report on the microbial transformation of 
ent
-kaurenes (

). It might have formed during extraction with an aqueous acid. Thus, it is likely that compound 
4
was formed by concomitant hydroxylation at the 11β position and bioepoxidation at the 15-double bond as an intermediate, followed by protonation and opening of the oxirane ring, and then neutralization of the cation formed at 
C-
16 by attacking the 11β- OH. In addition, 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. bainieri
</tp:taxon-name>
had the ability to introduce an OH group at 
C-
9 and also to rearrange the 
ent
-kaurene into an 
ent
-beyerane skeleton as in our previous report (

). Additionally, the bioactivity results presented herein suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of these compounds might not act through cell membrane signaling transduction, but occur downstream of the TLR4/MyD88 pathway. Despite that the interaction energies of 
2
and its derivatives to the GR were not as strong as that of dexamethasone, suppression of MCP or RANTES secretion in LPS-induced THP-1 cells and evidence of their molecular docking to the GR may provide molecular insights into the functions of 
2
and 

10–12
in

activating consecutive regulatory processes, especially in their anti-inflammatory effect. Further work is necessary to confirm their functions in cytokine secretion associated with inflammation. Additionally, based on results of this study, we successfully produced undescribed and useful specialized products using the microbial transformation technique.

The cytotoxicity of tested compounds to PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2 
H
- tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. MTT was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, 
USA
; 98% purity), and dissolved as a 
5 mg
/mL stock solution. After 24 h of tested compound treatment, MTT at a final concentration of 
0.5 mg
/mL was added to cells and incubated at 37 
◦
C
for 3 h. At the end of incubation, culture medium was removed, and 200 μL of DMSO (Sigma) was added to dissolve the blue formazan crystals. The absorbance was then measured using a model FLx800 Fluorescence Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, 
Vermont
, 
USA
) at 
570 nm
. Cell survival was expressed as a percentage of formazan absorbance, and normalized to the control (CTL) group. Results are presented as the mean value and standard deviation (SD) from three different experiments done in triplicate.

         <p>
Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’ s protocol. The concentration was determined based on the absorbance at 
260 nm
, and first-strand complementary (c)DNA was synthesized from total RNA using the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen) and Oligo(dT) primer. 
A
qPCR was used to quantify the mRNA level of the target gene. Amplification was carried out using the ABI Prism 7300 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,

THP-1 cell lysates were prepared using a lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and proteinase inhibitors (Roche, Nutley, NJ, 
USA
). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (DC Protein Assay Reagent, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,

USA
), or TLR4 (GTX125909, GeneTex Biotech) was incubated at 4

at a 1:1000 ratio overnight. β- Actin (1:2000, GTX109639, GeneTex Biotech) was used as a loading control. Membranes were then washed with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)- conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, 
USA
) at room temperature for 1 h. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ,

4.11. Molecular docking studies
</title>
         <p>
Molecular docking and scoring protocols were performed with the docking program, CDOCKER algorithm, in Discovery Studio 2017 (DS 2017) to investigate possible ligand-binding conformations within the GR binding pocket. The crystal structure of the GR-dexamethasone binding complex (PDB ID: 4UDC) (

), at a resolution of 2.5 
Å
, was downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. The structure and residues were refined in BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2017 (Biovia, San Diego, CA, 
USA
). Before the docking experiments, dexamethasone was removed from the refined 4UDC structure, and the binding site was defined as a sphere radius of 8 
Å
from the position of dexamethasone. Then a 3D ligand database of dexamethasone and compounds 
1–12
was built as a total of 305 conformations with the best conformation settings. Docking programs consisting of scoring and search facilitates are used to find low free-energy binding poses. The interaction energies between proteins and ligands were calculated with the CHARMm force field. The resulting poses of each trial were ranked by their energies that included the intra-interaction energy of the ligand and the interaction energy between the ligand and protein. CDOCKER embedded in DS 2017 was used for accurate and precise flexible docking. Each compound was employed for molecular docking experiments and data analyses. Most of the docking parameters were set to defaults for CDOCKER. The top ten CDOCKER energy analyses were collected from each compound for analysis. Potential activators were selected based on the CDOCKER interaction energy formed between compounds 
1–12
and GR.
