Specialised metabolites in lichens are generally considered repellent compounds by consumers. Nevertheless, if the only food available is lichens rich in specialised metabolites, lichenophages must implement strategies to overcome the toxicity of these metabolites. Thus, the balance between phagostimulant nutrients and deterrent metabolites could play a key role in feeding preferences. To further understand lichen-gastropod interactions, we studied the feeding behaviour and consumption in

</tp:taxon-name>
, the land snail native to sub-Antarctic islands. The lichen 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
was used because of its simple chemistry, its richness in usnic acid (specialised metabolite) and arabitol (primary metabolite) and its presence in snail habitats. Choice tests in arenas with intact lichens versus acetone-rinsed lichens were carried out to study the influence of specialised metabolites on snail behaviour and feeding preference. Simultaneously, usnic acid and arabitol were quantified and located within the lichen thallus using HPLC-DAD-MS and 
in situ
imaging by mass spectrometry to assess whether their spatial distribution explained preferential snail grazing. No-choice feeding experiments, with the pure metabolites embedded in an artificial diet, defined a gradual gustatory response, from strong repellence (usnic acid) to high appetence (D-arabitol). This case study demonstrates that the nutritional activity of

is governed by the chemical quality of the food and primarily by nutrient availability (arabitol), despite the presence of deterrent metabolite (usnic acid).

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Lichen symbiosis comprises a fungus, the mycobiont, and photosynthetic partners, the photobiont (chlorophytes and/or cyanobacteria). The mycobiont produces water-soluble specialised metabolites such as mycosporines (

) and lectines (

) but also hydrophobic metabolites such as depsides, depsidones and dibenzofurans (

). Hydrophobic metabolites accumulate as tiny crystals outside the fungal hyphae, in the cortex or the medulla of the lichen thallus (

). This extracellular localisation makes the metabolites easy to remove using the acetone-rinsing methodology, without degrading the viability and palatability of the lichen (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Because lichens are sessile and slow-growing symbiotic organisms, they must defend themselves strongly against lichenivores such as gastropods, which are important lichen feeders (

; 

; 

; 

). Many experiments have highlighted deterrent and/or toxic activity for some specialised metabolites towards invertebrates, including snails (

; 

; 

). Generalist lichenophage species prefer lichens with few specialised metabolites (

; 

; 

; 

; 

), but more than the total amount of metabolites, their nature turns out to be the main discriminant factor in food preference. In the accidental

<tp:taxon-name>
Lasioderma serricorne

avoided lichen species containing the dibenzofuran usnic acid, the depside atranorin or the depsidone fumarprotocetraric acid (

). In a similar way, when snails faced a mixture of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lobaria pulmonaria
</tp:taxon-name>
chemotypes with and without stictic acid (depsidone), a preferential grazing on the depsidone-free lichen was observed (

).

         <p>
If the only available resources are lichens rich in specialised metabolites, lichenophages must overcome or be able to metabolise potentially toxic specialised metabolites (

; 

). Thus, optimal foraging in generalist species implies a balance between defending against toxics and accessing useful nutrients. Indeed, lichen tissues also contain carbohydrates, including polysaccharides and reserve carbohydrates such as sugars and polyols. The phagostimulant properties of sugars have previously been highlighted to improve slug baits, particularly disaccharides that appeared more attractive than monosaccharides (

; 

). Gastropods have the full enzymatic arsenal to degrade and to assimilate sugars and polyols. However, the role of polyols in their feeding choices has not yet been confirmed (

; 

; 

).

As the sub-Antarctic snail

) is an exclusive lichen feeder, it appears to be a relevant model to advance the understanding of the chemical ecology of the lichen/snail interactions. In our previous works, a compromise between appetent polyols and potentially repulsive specialised metabolites was suggested. 
<tp:taxon-name>

is able to deal with potential toxic metabolites (

) and to select lichen parts according to their gustatory quality (

). Lichens are known to have a sectorial distribution of their specialised metabolites, which can be visualised by spectroscopic experiments as LDI-MSI or vibrational spectroscopy (

). However, it is still not known how the primary metabolites such as sugars and polyols are distributed within the lichen thallus.

In this study, we present the first spatial mapping of both attractive and repellent metabolites to account for the nutritional choices made by the snail. To address this question, the lichen 
<tp:taxon-name>
Usnea taylorii

</tp:taxon-name>
(

) was selected because of its simple chemistry. First, we followed the snail behaviour in feeding choice arenas to assess the defensive-compound hypothesis described by 

. We expected that acetone-rinsed thalli would promote food consumption compared to control thalli. At the same time, snails were subjected to no-choice feeding experiments using the pure metabolites embedded in an artificial diet, separately or together. We hypothesised a gradual gustatory response, from strong repellence (usnic acid) to high appetence (D-arabitol). Second, we intended to explore the spatial localisation of the main primary (D-arabitol) and specialised (usnic acid) metabolites of

using

mass spectrometry imaging. The patterns of distribution of the metabolites were expected to influence the snail feeding strategy.

            <p>
Microscopic analysis of the fruticose lichen 
<tp:taxon-name>
Usnea taylorii
</tp:taxon-name>
reveals a specific morphology that deserves a detailed description to better understand the location of metabolites (

complete morphological description of the lichen is available in Text S1). Apothecia (the reproductive parts of the lichen) are located at the apex of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Usnea
</tp:taxon-name>
branches and are characterised by their large diameter (
2–17 mm
) and their jet-black pigmented disc. In cross-section, underneath the black epithecium, asci containing spores are present in the hymenium, covering the algal layer (

). The thallus in cross-section shows a very thin cortex, protecting a discontinuous algal layer. The central axis of

The extraction yields with acetone ranged between 0.5 and 1.0% of specialised metabolites for the six replicates of dried lichen materials with a mean value of 0.8 ± 0.2%. Preliminary experiments showed that more than 95% of the specialised compounds were extracted from the lichen 
<tp:taxon-name>

by rinsing intact air-dried thalli in acetone. Thalli had only one or two main specialised metabolites. The concentration of usnic acid ranged from

dry mass (
DM
) of lichen, with a mean value ± s.d. of 4.1 ±

Preliminary LDI-MS analysis of an acetone extract of

's branch revealed that usnic acid was located in the peripheral layer of the thallus, 
i.e.,
in the cortex and in the uppermost parts of the medulla including the photobiont layer (

). Likewise, usnic acid was allocated to the external layers of the apothecium (epithecium, hymenium and the underside of the apothecium) (

). D-arabitol was present mainly in the lax medulla, the cortex and the algal layer (

), but occurred in lower intensities in the axial strands of the lichen branches. In apothecia, the signal corresponding to D-arabitol was stronger in the layer containing the lax medulla and algae than in the external layers of apothecium (epithecium and hymenium) (

). To perform a comparison between lichen parts eaten by snails or not, some branches and apothecia were sliced and analysed by LDI-MSI. Snails consumed parts of the cortex, the algal layer and the lax medulla of the branches. In apothecia, epithecium, hymenium as well as the underside of the apothecium were grazed. All these tissues contain usnic acid (

) and D-arabitol (

).

         <p>
There was no site effect on the distribution of snails in the feeding choice arenas (Chi 
2
= 0.397, df = 2, P = 0.820). During the nutritional phase, 67.9% (± se = 4.11%) of the snails preferred to stay near the rock shelter (rock versus intact lichen P &lt;0.001, rock versus rinsed lichen P &lt;0.001), while the rest of the snails were equally distributed (P = 0.70) in arms with intact (16.7 ± 2.5%) and rinsed lichens (15.5 ± 3.2%) (

         <p>
The removal of acetone-soluble metabolites did not promote lichen consumption (mean ± s. e. = 0.38 ± 0.12 μm

Tested metabolites (usnic acid and/or arabitol) were added to a starch gel at the mean concentrations found in the thalli. The feeding experiment lasted 48 h. Gel-mixed metabolites had a significant impact on their consumption by snails (Chi 
2
= 57.47, df = 3, P &lt;0.001; 
Fig. 7

3. Discussion
</title>
         <p>
The fruticose lichen 
<tp:taxon-name>
U. taylorii
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Parmeliaceae</tp:taxon-name>
), found in nutrientpoor environments, was expected to be increasingly grazed by the snail 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. hookeri
</tp:taxon-name>
, after acetone rinsing. Indeed, 

evidenced that acetone-rinsed lichens belonging to 
<tp:taxon-name>Parmeliaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, rich in specialised metabolites, were more palatable to generalist land snails. Contrary to our expectation, snails were equally distributed between rinsed and intact thalli in the four arms of the feeding choice arenas. Most of the snails were counted on the rocks in the two other arms, suggesting that 
<tp:taxon-name>
U. taylorii
</tp:taxon-name>
could not be a resting place after feeding. Although information about lichen choice was lost because 68% of the snails preferred the rocks, simulations made from the real data set confirmed that absence of difference was not a bias due to a very low power of the test (Table S2). Lichen consumption was not significantly different between treatments. Thus, removal of acetone-soluble metabolites of 
<tp:taxon-name>
U. taylorii
</tp:taxon-name>
did not increase lichen consumption by the snail. This result is consistent with the results of 

, who observed that usnic acid did not affect snail grazing on the lichen 

<tp:taxon-name>Lobaria scrobiculata</tp:taxon-name>
.

In contrast, 

described snail grazing (
<tp:taxon-name>
Cochlodina laminata
</tp:taxon-name>
) in depth after acetone rinsing of two 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lobaria
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, while the snail avoided the medulla before removal of acetone-soluble metabolites. However, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lobaria pulmonaria
</tp:taxon-name>
did not contain usnic acid (

), suggesting that other compounds (stictic acid derivatives) were deterrent. According to the study of 

only one of three lichen species containing at least usnic acid showed chemical snail defence. From a relationship with lichen frequency in field, the authors deduced that the more the lichen was frequent, the higher was the consumption by snails. This relationship cannot be the rule in the present study since 
<tp:taxon-name>
U. taylorii
</tp:taxon-name>
was absent from Branca site. By a deficit in specialised metabolites and a low concentration in usnic acid (
4.1 mg
g 
−1
), 
<tp:taxon-name>
U. taylorii
</tp:taxon-name>
appears closer to the lichens belonging to Physiaceae and Teloschistales described by 

although common in nutrient-rich environments. In these lichens, the author suggested that the specialised metabolites could protect thalli against excess light but could not deter grazing. In line with this, usnic acid is known to provide photoprotection to the algal cells (

) and regulate their development (Ba 
č
kor et al., 2010). 

showed that usnic acid was retrieved from faeces of 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. hookeri
</tp:taxon-name>
after 
<tp:taxon-name>
U. taylorii
</tp:taxon-name>
intake, meaning that the snail excreted the metabolite, but that did not mean that usnic acid was appetent and/or not toxic for the snail.
</p>
         <p>
None of the studies cited above considered primary metabolites as feeding stimulants. For this reason, isolated compounds were tested separately and in mixture, in no-choice experiments. Usnic acid deterred 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. hookeri
</tp:taxon-name>
when extracted and incorporated in a waxy starch gel, while it was consumed in lichen thalli. In contrast, 

observed that filter paper added with usnic acid from the lichen 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lobaria scrobiculata
</tp:taxon-name>
did not affect 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cepaea hortensis
</tp:taxon-name>
grazing, despite the high content used (
47.6 mg
g 
−1
). Filter paper, made of cellulose and known to be highly attractive to helicid snails, could be much more palatable than waxy starch was to 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. hookeri
</tp:taxon-name>
. In the present study, the repellent effect of pure usnic acid in the starch gel was mitigated by the addition of D-arabitol. The phagostimulant effect of D-arabitol for the snail has already been observed when the snail fed on the lichen 
<tp:taxon-name>
Argopsis friesiana
(
Gadea et al., 2018
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. In a similar way, sucrose increased the amount of agar baits ingested by the slug 
<tp:taxon-name>
Deroceras reticulatum
</tp:taxon-name>
, more than glucose, lactose and fructose (

). These studies highlight the key role of primary metabolites for phytophages. Polyols are attractive for snails as nutrient metabolites that provide energy after oxidative conversion and help produce mucus, which enables body hydration, locomotion, and food foraging (

). In sub-Arctic lichens, polyol leaching was positively correlated with polyol concentration and in wet conditions (after a rain event, for example, which is so common in the sub-Antarctic), lichens lose up to 10% of their polyols through leaching (

). Consequently, snails might be first attracted by the exudate of arabitol, licking it and then would start grazing the cortex containing usnic acid. In contrast, the gustatory receptors of the snails (i.e. buccal lips and anterior tentacles) were in direct contact with usnic acid when the metabolite was incorporated to starch gels, thus revealing its role in chemical snail defence. Mass spectrometry imaging of the two metabolites gave arguments in support of the snail feeding pattern in the field. Spatial mapping revealed that arabitol and usnic acid were found partly collocated in the cortex and in the apothecia. Accordingly, the snails preferred to graze the apothecia, the lax medulla and the cortex that contained both fungal mycelium and algae with usnic acid and arabitol. In addition to arabitol leaching, the high concentration of arabitol in 
<tp:taxon-name>
U. taylorii
</tp:taxon-name>
, thirty times as much as usnic acid, might explain why the feeding stimulus “arabitol” was stronger than the repellent stimulus “usnic acid”. This case study reveals that, as in plant-phytophage interactions (

), primary metabolites are able to overcome deterrent metabolites and should be considered as important as specialised metabolites in lichen-lichenophage interactions.

4. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
High amounts of arabitol, useful for lichen survival in cold places, makes 
<tp:taxon-name>
Usnea taylorii
</tp:taxon-name>
vulnerable to grazing by a generalist gastropod, despite the production of a deterrent compound, namely, usnic acid. In addition to classical feeding experiments, the mass spectrometry imaging of deterrent and attractive compounds improved our knowledge of lichen/snail trophic interactions. Although snails are often classified as opportunistic feeders, their nutritional activity appears governed by the chemical quality of the food and primarily by nutrient availability. This lichen/snail case study could be applied to other biological models, for instance, terrestrial gastropods well known as crop pests in agriculture, horticulture and orchards.

HPLC separation and quantification of usnic acid and

France
) equipped with a Kinetex C 
18
HPLC column (100 × 
4.6 mm
, 2.6 μm, 6A, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, 
USA
). The HPLC system comprises a quaternary pump (LC20ASDP), a surveyor autosampler (SIL-20AHT) and a diode array detector (SPD-M20A). The separation was achieved using an acidic water/acetonitrile system as previously described (

). The ESI-mass spectra were obtained from an Expression Advion CMS apparatus (Advion, Ithaca, 
USA
). The mass spectra were recorded in the negative-ion mode in a mass range of 100–1200 Da, applying the same parameters previously described by 

. The spectral data from the photodiode array detector were collected 48 min over the 
200–500 nm
range of the absorption spectrum, and the chromatograms were plotted at the maximum wavelength of absorption (
λ
max
) of the main metabolites. Peaks were assigned according to the retention time, UV spectra and mass spectra. The same chromatographic method was applied for the standards and the samples.

5.3.3. Analytical method validation
</title>

All validation parameters were determined following the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines (

) using HPLC analyses, and the following characteristics were evaluated: linearity, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), repeatability inter-day and intra-day. Four stock standard solutions of (+)-usnic acid (Sigma-Aldrich; 329967) were prepared by dissolving approximately 
2 mg
in 4 mL tetrahydrofuran to reach a concentration of 
0.5 mg
mL 
−1
. Then, six working standard solutions of usnic acid were prepared by appropriate dilution of each stock solution with acetonitrile to generate concentrations ranging from 
0.07 to 0.09 mg
mL 
−1
for the external standard calibration curve and the determination of the regression line. Hence, the concentrations of usnic acid in 
<tp:taxon-name>
U. taylorii
</tp:taxon-name>
were calculated, based on peak areas. The limits of detection and quantification were determined from the y-intercept standard deviation and the slope of the calibration curve. For the calculation of the intra-day repeatability, a dilution of usnic acid (
0.05 mg
mL

samples were hand-cut using a razor blade to afford slices approximately 100 μm thick. Branches and apothecia slices were fixed on a carbon-conductive adhesive tape that was, in turn, fixed on an indium tin oxide (ITO) slide (Bruker Daltonics, 
Bremen
, 
Germany
, cat. no. 237001). For laser desorption ionisation (LDI)-MSI measurement, no further preparation step was required. For matrix-assisted laser desorption Ionisation (MALDI)-MSI measurements, DHB matrix solution (
50 mg
mL 

− 
1

in 50% methanol) was homogeneously applied with a custom-designed spraying robot.
</p>
         <p>
All MSI measurements were performed using an Autoflex-Speed MALDI-TOF/TOF spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, 
Bremen
, 
Germany
) equipped with a Smartbeam laser (
355 nm
, 1000 Hz) and controlled using the Flex Control 3.4 software package. The mass spectrometer was used in the reflectron mode with a negative polarity for LDI-MSI and a positive polarity for MALDI-MSI. Spectra were acquired in the mass range of m/z 100–600 for all (x, y) coordinates corresponding to the imaged tissue.
</p>
         <p>The laser raster size was set at 35 μm. The signal was initially optimised by manually adjusting the laser power and the number of laser shots fired. Accordingly, full-scan MS experiments were run by accumulating 400 laser shots per raster position and by using the laser power leading to the best signal-to-noise ratio. Image acquisition was performed using the Flex Imaging 4.0 (Bruker Daltonics) software package. The correlation of the target plate with the optical image was obtained from three distinct teaching points following the procedure of the Flex Imaging software (Bruker Daltonics).</p>

Each fertile thallus of

was divided into two pieces of equal size, always containing a branch with the terminal apothecia. Half of these thalli were randomly taken to extract the specialised metabolites and constituted the rinsed lichens (“Rinsed”). The other group contained intact lichens (“Intact”).

hookeri per site were divided randomly into eight subgroups of 21 snails. No significant differences in shell size were observed among snail subgroups (mean ± s.d. = 4.80 ± 0.37; ANOVA, F = 1.590, df = 7, P = 0.137). Two days before the experiment, snails were starved to enhance their feeding motivation. The snails were placed inside a feeding choice arena with six arms, made of plexiglass (Plast'it supplier, Rennes, 
France
, under the concept proposed by Dr. Maryvonne Charrier, 
Fig. 8
). Wet synthetic foam was placed at the bottom of each arena to maintain strong humidity necessary for snail activity. Similar lichen samples were placed at both ends in opposite arms, giving the choice between two: two “Intact” and two “Rinsed” samples. To avoid a stressful condition for snails used to aggregate under a shelter (

), the two latter arms contained a small bare rock each, representing secure refuges during resting phases. The experiment was replicated eight times per site. Each feeding choice arena received 21 snails and was maintained in a climatic chamber under a light/dark photoperiod set as site did not have a significant effect, a second model was built without any independent variable, that allowed the comparison of the proportion of individuals choosing each treatment (intact lichen, rinsed lichen and rock) using a series of Wald tests where p-values were corrected using the false discovery rate method. To analyse lichen consumption (areas in μm 
2
) according to the treatment (intact versus rinsed) and the snail sampling site, a Wald test was applied on a GLMM (family: quasi, link: identity, variance: 
V
= 
μ
).
</p>
         <p>
In the no-choice experiments, to determine if metabolites were differently consumed compared to the control, a likelihood ratio test was used on a generalised linear model (GLM, distribution: negative binomial, link function: log), in which the snail sampling site was introduced as a fixed factor. Tukey's post hoc pairwise comparisons were realised. As no differences between sampling sites were observed on the feeding score (χ 
2
= 0.69, df = 1, P = 0.408), the results of both sampling sites were combined. All statistical analyses were made using R software V. 3.4.3 (R 

). The R packages used were: car, emmeans, lme 4, nnet, MASS, MuMin and RVAideMemoire. follows: 10 ̊C day (12 h) and 6 ̊C night (12 h). A rotation of the arenas was done four times a day to avoid a position effect in the climatic chamber. Experiments started at the beginning of the nocturnal phase and ended 48 h after.
</p>
         <p>
To analyse snail distribution, the position of each snail in the arena was reported. To evaluate lichen consumption, radula marks on lichen thalli were observed under stereomicroscope (Zeiss, 
France
). The area of radula impacts was measured (in μm 
2
/snail) with Labscope software (version 2.0, Zeiss, 
France
).

5.6.2. No-choice experiments on isolated compounds
</title>
         <p>
Two hundred and forty adult snails were separated into four subgroups: one control and three tested groups of 60 snails each (usnic acid, usnic acid + arabitol and arabitol). No significant difference in shell size was observed among subgroups (mean ± s.d. = 4.81 ± 
0.33 mm
; ANOVA, F = 2.472, df = 3, P = 0.062). No-choice experiments were performed in two-compartment Petri dishes (Greiner Bio One, 
Austria
). Wet nonwoven sterile gauze was placed in each compartment to maintain high humidity. Waxy starch gels were prepared at the concentration of 15% and small discs (diameter: 
5 mm
, thickness 
2 mm
) were manufactured using a custom-designed device (Plast'it supplier, Rennes, 
France
, under the concept proposed by Dr. Maryvonne Charrier). Metabolites (usnic acid, arabitol or a mixture of usnic acid and arabitol) were added to the gel at the same concentrations as those quantified in the entire fertile thalli (
4 mg
g 
−1
for usnic acid and 
100 mg
g 
−1
for arabitol). Waxy starch gels alone were considered as positive controls. Snails had no choice, either facing a gel containing metabolite or a control gel, for 48 h. At the end of the experiment, gels were photographed, and a feeding score was estimated. To calculate the feeding score, a calibrated grid placed on the gel provided the area consumed, then a correction factor was applied (×1 for consumption of the surface layer and ×2 when the gel was consumed in its full thickness;
