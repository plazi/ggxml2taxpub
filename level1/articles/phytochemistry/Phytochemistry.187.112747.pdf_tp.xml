The leaf intercellular space is a site of plant-microbe interactions where pathogenic bacteria such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pseudomonas syringae
</tp:taxon-name>
grow. In 

<tp:taxon-name>Arabidopsis thaliana</tp:taxon-name>
,

the biosynthesis of tryptophan-derived indolic metabolites is induced by 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. syringae
</tp:taxon-name>
infection. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry-based profiling and biosynthetic mutants, we investigated the role of indolic compounds and other small molecules in the response of mature 
<tp:taxon-name>
Arabidopsis
</tp:taxon-name>
to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. syringae
</tp:taxon-name>
. We observed dihydrocamalexic acid (DHCA), the precursor to the defense-related compound camalexin, accumulating in intercellular washing fluids (IWFs) without further conversion to camalexin. The indolic biosynthesis mutant 
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
was more susceptible to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. syringae
</tp:taxon-name>
compared to mature wild-type plants displaying age-related resistance (ARR). DHCA and structural analogs inhibit 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. syringae
growth
</tp:taxon-name>
(MIC ~ 500 μg/mL), but not at concentrations found in IWFs, and DHCA did not inhibit biofilm formation 
in vitro
. However, infiltration of exogenous DHCA enhanced resistance in mature 
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
. These results provide evidence that DHCA derived from 
CYP
71 
A
12 and 
CYP
71 
A
13 activity accumulates in the intercellular space and contributes to the resistance of mature 
<tp:taxon-name>
Arabidopsis
</tp:taxon-name>
to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. syringae
</tp:taxon-name>
without directly inhibiting bacterial growth.

The leaf intercellular space comprises the air-filled area between plant cells (including the cell wall) and fluids that accumulate along the plant cell wall (O’ 

). This dynamic environment is the site of beneficial and pathogenic plant-bacteria interactions; within hours of pathogen detection, conditions in the intercellular space change in an attempt to prevent bacterial colonization (

; 

; O’ 

). Intercellular components can be studied by infiltrating the leaf intercellular space with water, solvents, or buffers, followed by collecting the intercellular washing fluids through centrifugation. Intercellular washing fluids (IWFs) contain plant and bacterial metabolites and components from the plant cell wall (O’ 

, 

; 

). Specialised metabolites with antimicrobial activity (also known as phytoalexins) accumulate in response to pathogen exposure (

; 

) and localization of specialised metabolites to the intercellular space may act to limit the pathogenicity of bacteria, but the identity of these compounds and their mode(s) of action are not well understood (

Age is a relevant factor in the outcome of plant-pathogen and plantherbivore interactions, as many plants become more resistant to pathogens and pests as they mature (Develey-Rivi`ere and 

; 

). In the model species

(cabbage looper larvae) increases with age (

; 

; 

; 

). In several cases, age-related resistance (ARR) has been associated with changes in specialised metabolite accumulation. For example, 

used non-targeted metabolomics to show that terpenoids and flavonoids in mature fruit peels are a major contributor to cucumber fruit resistance against the oomycete

<tp:taxon-name>

and intercellular accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) plays a role in inhibition of growth and biofilm formation of 
Pst
(

; 

; 

). Biofilms are composed of bacterial cell aggregates embedded in a matrix of polysaccharides, extracellular DNA, and proteins that provide a protective environment against antimicrobials (

; 

). The formation of biofilm involves bacteria sensing and responding to environmental cues, and bacteria in biofilms have different metabolic and gene expression profiles than free-swimming planktonic bacteria, which can contribute to antibiotic resistance or susceptibility (

; Mas´ak et al., 2014). Inhibition of virulence factors involved in biofilm formation but not growth may be a successful strategy for plants since it reduces selection for antibiotic-resistant populations (

; 

). Biofilm-like aggregation has been reported for

form a metabolic branchpoint in the biosynthesis of three main classes of defense-related indole molecules: indole-3-carboxylic acid (ICOOH) derivatives, indole carbonylnitrile (ICN) derivatives, and camalexin (Bottcher ¨et al., 2009; 

; 

; 

, 

; 

; 

, 
Fig. 1
). In the case of camalexin biosynthesis, alpha-hydroxy IAN is converted to dehydro-IAN mainly through 
CYP
71 
A
13 activity with minor contribution from 
CYP
71 
A
12 activity (

; 

). Dehydro-IAN is conjugated to glutathione (GSH(IAN)) and catabolized to a cysteine conjugated form (Cys (IAN)) through γ- glutamyl peptidase and/or γ- glutamyl transpeptidase activity (

; 

; 

). Cys (IAN) cyclizes non-enzymatically to 
<tp:taxon-name>form dihydrocamalexic</tp:taxon-name>
acid (DHCA) and is also the substrate for the multifunctional enzyme 
CYP
71 
B
15, which catalyzes the formation of both DHCA and camalexin through two sequential reaction steps (Bottcher ¨et al., 2009; 

; 

,

).
</p>
         <p>
Alpha-hydroxy-IAN is converted to ICN via FOX1 activity or to indole-3-carbaldehyde and indole-3-carboxylic acid via 
CYP
71 
B
6 and AAO1 activity (
B¨ottcher
et al., 2009;

CYP
71 
A
12 activity, but not 
CYP
71

was previously reported as upregulated in mature wild 
type
(Col-0) 
<tp:taxon-name>

the response of mature 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
to 
Pst
we initially screened the 
cyp71a13
TDNA insertion mutant for ARR defects. The 
cyp71a13
mutant had an inconsistent ARR response; it supported wild-type levels of bacteria at 3 weeks old (Table 
S1.1
), but at 7 weeks old had a variable response to 
Pst
, supporting wild-type levels of bacteria in six of seven experiments (Table 
S1.2
). The amino acid sequence of CYP71A12 is 89% identical to CYP71A13 and can partially compensate for the loss of 
CYP71A13
as demonstrated using 
in vitro
and heterologous pathway reconstitution and metabolite profiling of biosynthetic mutants (Bottcher ¨et al., 2009; 

; Morten E. 

; 

; 

; 

), which may explain the variable response to 
Pst
of mature 
cyp71a13
. The partial redundancy of CYP71A12 and CYP71A13 and the tandem location of these genes made it difficult to study the role of this pathway in resistance until 

developed a 
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
double mutant through gene editing. The mature 
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
double mutant is consistently more susceptible to 
Pst
, supporting 2- to 8-fold higher bacterial levels compared to mature Col-0 (

CYP71B15 acts downstream of CYP71A12 and CYP71A

the biosynthesis of camalexin and the

Pst
inoculation by pressure infiltration into the intercellular space regardless of age (
Fig. 2

showed that 
cyp71b15
(4–5 weeks post-germination) was more susceptible to 
Pst
than Col-0 when using a spray-inoculation technique meant to represent the natural infection process more accurately, whereby bacteria on the leaf surface can only enter the intercellular space via stomatal openings. Since we were searching for potential intercellular antimicrobial compounds, we pressure infiltrated bacteria directly into the intercellular space of leaves to bypass the potential confounding effects of disruption of stomatal signaling mechanisms that have been shown to occur in some mutants for biosynthetic genes (

; 

). The 
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
and 
cyp71b15
mutants both produce trace amounts of camalexin (B¨ottcher et al., 2009;

response to

         <p>
As mentioned, 
CYP
71 
A
12 and 
CYP
71 
A
13 form a metabolic branch point in the production of precursors that serve as a substrate for enzymes in trp-derived specialised metabolism, so it was unknown which, if any, downstream compounds were present in the intercellular space in response to 
Pst
. Therefore, we used non-targeted, high-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to examine the accumulation of all detectable semi-polar metabolites in mature plants’ intercellular space after 
Pst
inoculation in Col-0, 
cyp71b15
(wild-type resistance despite perturbation in trp-derived metabolite pathway downstream of 
CYP
71 
A
12 and 
CYP
71 
A
13), and 
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
(increased susceptibility to 
Pst
when mature compared to Col-0). We focused on mature plants because of the increased susceptibility observed in mature 

cyp71a12/cyp71a 
13

in ARR assays and because 7-week-old rosette leaves were well suited for the infiltration-centrifugation technique (O’ 

) used to collect required volumes of intercellular washing fluids (IWFs) for metabolite profiling from mock- and 
Pst
-inoculated plants. Minimal cytoplasmic contamination in IWFs was confirmed by assessing chlorophyll levels spectrophotometrically (

).
</p>
         <p>
To identify mass spectral features that may be important for 
Pst
resistance in mature plants, we first performed a pairwise comparison via volcano plot between mock- and 
Pst
-inoculated wild 
type
IWFs (
Fig. S1
). Principal component analysis (PCA) of all features showed that the first two components account for 93.7% of the total variance in IWFs run in positive ESI mode (
Fig. S2A
) and 90.4% of the total variance in negative ESI mode (
Fig. S2B
). Mock- and 
Pst
-inoculated samples formed distinct clusters in both ESI modes, although the clusters are more separated in negative ESI mode. In total, 26 features were found to be significantly different between IWFs from wild 
type
mock- and 
Pst
- inoculated leaves (
Fig. S1
; Table 
S2.1
, 2.2, 2.3). Next, we compared the accumulation of these 26 features between susceptible and resistant genotypes by including IWFs collected from 
cyp71b15
(wild-type 
Pst
resistance) and 
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
(increased susceptibility to 
Pst
) using one-way ANOVA (
Fig. S3
). We pursued mass features that could be functional in resistance to 
Pst
, rather than features solely reflecting perturbation of trp-derived specialised metabolism in 
cyp71a12/ cyp71a13
. These compounds should have different accumulation patterns in the resistant genotypes (Col-0 and 
cyp71b15
) compared to susceptible ones (
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
). Two features were significantly different between resistant (Col-0, 
cyp71b15
) and susceptible (
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
) genotypes (
Fig. S3-E, Q
): one at 6.96 min with a nominal mass of 
m/z
322 corresponding to a glycosylated indole-3- carboxylic acid (ICOOH), and the other at 7.32 min with a nominal mass of 
m/z
247 corresponding to the camalexin precursor, dihydroxycamalexic acid (DHCA).
</p>
         <p>
The feature that eluted at 6.96 min with a nominal mass of 
m/z
322 was putatively identified as an indole-3-carboxylic acid beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester with a mass error of 1.9 ppm (
m/z

m/z
116.0503 corresponding to an indole ring ([C

Fig. S4
), which is consistent with fragmentation behavior for this compound noted by 
B¨ottcher
et al. (2014, 2009). This feature was elevated in IWFs from resistant plants (Col-0 and 
cyp71b15
) compared to IWFs from susceptible 
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
plants (
Fig. S3-Q
). 

showed that 6-week-old 
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
produces reduced levels of glycosylated ICOOH compared to wild-type 
<tp:taxon-name>Arabidopsis</tp:taxon-name>
in response to abiotic stressors (
UV
exposure and silver nitrate). ICOOH derivatives are also constitutively produced but accumulate at elevated levels after pathogen challenge in 
<tp:taxon-name>Arabidopsis</tp:taxon-name>
(

; 

; 

; 

). ICOOH is esterified to the cell wall in response to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. syringae
</tp:taxon-name>
and has been hypothesized to prevent localized bacterial aggregation or act as an antimicrobial compound by intercalating into the bacterial membrane (

; 

). Indole-3-carboxylic acid beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester accumulated at 400–600 pmol in leaves of 6-week-old 
<tp:taxon-name>Arabidopsis</tp:taxon-name>
in response to 
Pst
at 48 h post-inoculation and was hypothesized to function as a transport intermediate for ICOOH cell wall conjugation (

). Recent work by 

confirmed that 
CYP
71 
A
12, but not 
CYP
71 
A
13, is required for accumulation of two glycosylated ICOOH products (6-O-glucoside of 6-hydroxy-indole-3-carboxylic acid and indole-3-carboxylic acid glucose ester) in the leaves of 4-week-old plants in response to the fungal pathogen 
<tp:taxon-name>
Plectosphaerella cucumerina
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
It is also possible that the peak corresponding to an ICOOH glucopyranosyl ester is a degradation product of compounds derived from indole carbonylnitriles (ICNs). ICN compounds are unstable and rapidly degrade to ICOOH in aqueous solution (

). In the context of our work, ICN degradation to ICOOH could occur between the time bacteria (in aqueous solution) are first pressure infiltrated into the leaf intercellular space and when IWFs are collected by centrifugation 24 h later, although given the role of 
CYP
71 
A
12 in
ICN biosynthesis (
Fig. 1
), we would expect a mass feature corresponding to glycosylated ICOOH to be absent from 
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
if it was an ICN degradation product.
</p>
         <p>
Probing the contribution of ICOOH pathways in response to bacteria in the intercellular space requires consideration of differences in constitutive and induced ICOOH pathways, the complexity of downstream derivatives (e.g., glycosylated and amino acid conjugates, indolering hydroxylations), and the fact that not all the genes involved in these pathways have been fully elucidated (
B¨ottcher
et al., 2014; 

; 

; 

). Further work examining the resistance phenotype of 
cyp71a12
mutants in combination with other genes with minor contribution to pathogen induced ICOOH biosynthesis (i.e., 
cyp71b6, aao1
) to 
Pst
may reveal more about the role of ICOOH compounds in disease resistance (

; 

). Given the previously mentioned studies supporting a role for ICOOH derivatives in pathogen resistance, we chose to pursue investigation of the mass feature at 7.32 min that resembled DHCA.

, DHCA accumulated to ~0.3 μg/mL and ~0.24 μg/mL in IWFs collected from mature wild-type and

). Mock-inoculated wild-type plants did not produce detectable levels of intercellular DHCA, and mock-inoculated 
cyp71b15
accumulated DHCA (~0.09 μg/mL), likely due to a block in camalexin biosynthesis whereby a cysteine-conjugated indole-3-acetonitrile (Cys (IAN)) precursor accumulates, and non-enzymatically cyclizes to produce DHCA (
B¨ottcher

DHCA may be directly transported to the intercellular space, but the release of DHCA from 
CYP
71 
B
15 would have to occur during the sequential conversion of Cys (IAN) to DHCA and then camalexin (

). Recent research by Mucha and colleagues (

) suggest that metabolons consisting of 
CYP
71

12, 
CYP
71 
A
13, and 
CYP
71 
B
15 provide efficient channeling of bioactive indolic intermediates to 
<tp:taxon-name>form camalexin</tp:taxon-name>
; it is therefore unlikely that appreciable levels of DHCA and other intermediates are released from these enzyme complexes during camalexin biosynthesis.
</p>
         <p>
Glutathione-conjugated IAN (GSH(IAN)), Cys (IAN), or intermediates formed during catabolism of GSH(IAN) to Cys (IAN) may be transported to the intercellular space where they could be converted enzymatically or non-enzymatically to DHCA. This part of the camalexin pathway is difficult to elucidate due to functional redundancy in enzyme families and 
in vitro
substrate promiscuity of the enzymes hypothesized to produce these intermediates (

; 

; 

, 

). In cytosolic camalexin biosynthesis, γ- glutamyl peptidase 1 (GGP1) and 3 (GGP3) are the enzymes involved in the catabolism of GSH(IAN) to Cys (IAN), and double mutants for these genes have reduced camalexin production in response to chemical inducers (

). The γ- glutamyl transpeptidases GGT1 and GGT2 are not likely to be involved in cytosolic camalexin production as 
GGT1
is not upregulated in response to chemical inducers and 
GGT2
is not expressed in leaves (

; 

). However, given that GGT1 and GGT2 are localized to the apoplast, they could be involved in the production of DHCA in the intercellular space in response to 
Pst
(

; 

). In that case, GGT1 and GGT2 involvement in DHCA biosynthesis would require transport of a glutathione-IAN conjugate such as γ- GSH-, Gly-Cys-, or Cys-Glu-(IAN) to the intercellular space.
</p>
         <p>

revealed a possible mechanism for how bioactive intermediates can be released during camalexin biosynthesis. They showed that glutathione-S-transferase (GST) U4 physically interacts with 
CYP
71 
A
13 and negatively regulates camalexin biosynthesis in response to pathogens. The regulatory mechanism is unknown, but the authors discussed the possibility that GSTs interact with an ER-associated camalexin biosynthetic metabolon to transport intermediates to other subcellular compartments. In the context of our work, intercellular DHCA may be accumulating as a result of transport of IAN conjugates from the camalexin biosynthetic metabolon, followed by cytosolic and/or intercellular GGP/GGT activity and non-enzymatic cyclization resulting in accumulation of DHCA without further conversion to camalexin by 
CYP
71 
B
15. This model for DHCA accumulation in the intercellular space (
Fig. S5
) is speculative at this time and mass features corresponding to IAN conjugates were not detected in IWFs at 24 hpi with 
Pst
regardless of genotype or treatment (Table 
S

GGP
and 
GGT
mutants, 
GST4U
knockouts and over-expressors, as well as screening for candidate genes encoding glutathione-conjugate ABC transporters (

;

<tp:taxon-name>P. syringae growth</tp:taxon-name>
         </p>
         <p>
To examine the ability of DHCA to inhibit the growth of 
Pst
, bacteria were incubated with concentrations of 0.05–1000 μg/mL DHCA and bacterial growth was measured spectrophotometrically (OD 
600
). 
Hrpinducing
minimal (HIM) medium was used for all 
in vitro
assays in this work to mimic the conditions of the intercellular space and induce bacterial virulence gene expression in the bacteria (

; 

; 

). To test for 
Pst
’s ability to use DHCA as a nutrient source, assays with DHCA as the sole source of carbon or nitrogen and sulfur were performed using concentrations that showed little to no bacterial growth inhibition (1–32 μg/mL). 
Pst
survived, but no growth was observed, indicating that 
Pst
did not use DHCA as a nutrient source (
Fig. S6
).
</p>
         <p>
DHCA displayed inhibitory activity against 
Pst
at concentrations above 96 μg/mL but did not inhibit growth at the range of concentrations observed in IWFs (0.3 μg/mL to 2.4 μg/mL). DHCA had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ~500 μg/mL and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ~ 
1 mg
/mL (
Fig. 5A
). In comparison, the MIC and MBC of salicylic acid, an intercellular compound with antimicrobial activity that contributes 
Pst
observed in mature plants, is approximately 250 μg/mL and 500 μg/mL, respectively (Cameron and Zaton, 2004; 

; 
Fig. S7
). Since current intercellular profiling techniques require full hydration of the leaf for downstream profiling, IWF measurements represent the amount of compound washed out of the intercellular space and do not account for the possibility of localized concentration gradients (

; 

). For example, plant metabolites may accumulate at sites of bacterial aggregation or in the cell wall at high concentrations.

2.1.4. Dihydrocamalexic acid does not inhibit

formation

</p>
         <p>
Indole-3-acetonitrile (~100 μg/mL) and indole-3-acetaldehyde (~100 μg/mL) have been shown to inhibit biofilm formation of the bacterial pathogens 

E
. coli

O157:H7 and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
</tp:taxon-name>
, potentially by interfering with intercellular signaling and affecting the expression of genes required for biofilm formation without affecting bacterial growth (

). To test the activity of DHCA against 
Pst
biofilm formation, a spectrophotometric 96-well plate biofilm assay was used (see Materials and Methods; O’ 

). To ensure that these tests would reflect reduced biofilm formation rather than inhibition of growth, DHCA concentrations were chosen to avoid the reduction of bacterial growth (0.3–18 μg/mL). SA was used as a positive control as it has bioactivity against 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. syringae
</tp:taxon-name>
biofilms, inhibiting their formation 
in vitro
at concentrations as low as 2 μM (~ 
270 ng
/mL). As previously observed (

), biofilm formation was reduced in the presence of 18 μg/mL SA at 48 and 72 h (
Fig. 6A
). However, DHCA did not significantly affect biofilm formation at any concentrations or time points tested (
Fig. 6B
). These results show that DHCA does not inhibit biofilm formation of 
Pst in vitro.

2.1.5. Structure-activity relationship of DHCA chirality and indole moiety
</title>
         <p>
To examine how structural components of DHCA may affect its antimicrobial activity against planktonic (free individual cells not part of an aggregate) 
Pst,
structure-activity studies were completed using camalexin and synthetic enantiomers of phenylalanine and tyrosinederived analogs of DHCA (
Fig. 5
). Camalexin differs structurally in that it lacks chirality provided by the carboxylic acid functional group on carbon 4 of the thiazole ring of DHCA. The antimicrobial activity of camalexin was similar to that reported for DHCA; camalexin has a MIC of ~500 μg/mL when incubated with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. syringae
</tp:taxon-name>
pv. 
Maculicola
in camalexin-spiked IWFs (

), and a MIC of ~250 μg/mL when incubated with 
Pst
in HIM medium (
Fig. 5B
).
</p>
         <p>
To examine how the indole ring contributes to growth inhibition against 
Pst
, analogs of DHCA were synthesized with the indole ring replaced with a phenyl (Compounds 
1
and 

2
in

Fig. 5
) or a phenol (Compounds 
3
and 

4
in

Fig. 5
) group. Stereochemistry had a marked effect on antimicrobial activity for the phenyl ring analogs as analog 
1
lacked growth inhibitory activity against 
Pst
at any of the concentrations tested (
Fig. 5C
). Analog 
2
was more effective at inhibiting the growth of 
Pst
compared to DHCA, with a similar MIC as camalexin (~250 μg/mL; 
Fig. 5D
); however, it was less bactericidal than DHCA and camalexin, as 
1 mg
/mL of analog 
2
was not lethal to 
Pst
(Fig. 
S
8). Replacement of the indolic ring with a phenol moiety causes loss of antimicrobial activity regardless of stereochemistry as 
Pst
growth was unaffected by incubation with analogs 
3
and 
4
(
Fig. 5E and F
).
</p>
         <p>
DHCA may have a similar mode of action as camalexin for 
Pst
growth inhibition but is not as effective due to the carboxylic acid moiety. Camalexin rapidly disrupts membrane integrity in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. syringae
</tp:taxon-name>
, and due to its lipophilic nature, it does not dissociate from dying cells such that any surviving bacterial cells continue to grow (

). The hydroxyl substitution on the ring of compounds 
3
and 
4
may render the molecule less lipophilic, disrupting the association of camalexin and possibly DHCA with bacterial membranes, whereas the more lipophilic phenyl ring of compounds 
1
and 
2
still allows for membrane association. However, compound 
1
did not inhibit 
Pst
growth, while compound 
2
did, indicating that chirality may affect the antibacterial activity of DHCA. Indeed, chirality can result in vastly different outcomes on the target organism, including adverse toxic effects or a loss of bioactivity (Hutt and O’ Grady, 1996; 

). Comparing the antimicrobial activity of (
S
)-DHCA and (R)-DHCA could clarify whether chirality is a contributing factor to bacterial growth inhibition. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining antimicrobial activity of DHCA. Additional investigation is required to understand the bio-transformations and potential target interactions between DHCA and bacteria.

2.2. Dihydrocamalexic acid treatment restores bacterial resistance in cyp71a12/cyp71a13
</p>
         <p>
The absence of DHCA in IWFs from 
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
does not necessarily indicate a role for DHCA in resistance to 
Pst
. Rather, our results may be due to the blockage of DHCA production in 
cyp71a12/ cyp71a13. In vitro
assays demonstrated that DHCA inhibited 
Pst
growth at concentrations higher than those quantified in IWF samples, and DHCA did not inhibit biofilm formation of 
Pst
. However, 
in vitro
antimicrobial studies do not capture the complex metabolic and physiological changes occurring in plants responding to pathogens (

). If DHCA is important for the response of mature plants to 
Pst,
then reintroducing the compound should restore resistance to 
cyp71a12/a13
plants. To test this, exogenous DHCA (0.07 μg/mL or 0.25 μg/mL) was pressure-infiltrated into the intercellular space of rosette leaves 24 h post-inoculation with 
Pst
.
</p>
         <p>
Infiltration of DHCA at a concentration similar to that quantified in wild 
type
IWFs (0.25 μg/mL; 1.02 μM) 24 h after mock or 
Pst
inoculation restored wild-type levels of resistance in mature 
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
, causing a 10-fold reduction in bacterial levels compared to mock-inoculated plants (
Fig. 7
). Infiltration of a lower level of DHCA (0.07 μg/mL; 0.28 μM) resulted in a modest increased resistance in 
cyp71a12/ cyp71a13
, causing a 1.6-fold reduction in bacterial levels compared to mock-inoculated plants (
Fig. 7
). Wild-type resistance to 
Pst
in mature plants was not significantly affected by infiltration of either concentration of DHCA and did not exhibit an enhanced resistance response.
</p>
         <p>
Combined with our antimicrobial studies, these results suggest that DHCA affects 
Pst
pathogenicity via mechanisms other than direct antimicrobial activity (e.g., by affecting enzyme activity, receptor binding, affecting plant defense or bacterial virulence signaling) or requires other compounds (e.g., ICOOH-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester) for additive/ synergistic interactions to be fully effective – mechanisms plants use to avoid the development of bacterial resistance (

; 

; 

; 

). 
In vitro
studies have demonstrated that camalexin inhibits glycolysis, TCA pathway gene expression and reduces mycelial growth in 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. brassicicola
(
Pedras et al., 2014
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. Camalexin has also been shown to inhibit fungal detoxification enzymes involved in the metabolism of the plant defense compounds brassinin and cyclobrassinin in isolates from canola and brown mustard (

). Likewise, DHCA may interfere with 
Pst
virulence genes or proteins through binding interactions or affecting changes in plant or bacterial gene expression. If this is the case, it would explain why the concentration of DHCA in IWFs from resistant plants does not directly inhibit bacterial growth 
in vitro
and why mature 
cyp71b15
does not display enhanced resistance to 
Pst
despite an ~6.5-fold increase in intercellular DHCA compared to mature wild 
type
plants.

3. Conclusion
</title>
         <p>
Using a metabolomics approach with two biosynthetic mutants in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. thaliana
</tp:taxon-name>
trp-derived specialised metabolism pathway, two mass spectral features (corresponding to a glycosylated indole-3-carboxylic acid derivative and dihydrocamalexic acid) were identified in intercellular washing fluids. Both compounds accumulated in response to 
Pst
and to different extents in mature resistant and susceptible genotypes. We confirmed that differential accumulation had a function in plant defense since 
cyp71a12/cyp71a13
was more susceptible to 
Pst
and defective for intercellular DHCA accumulation. Also, exogenous infiltration of DHCA into the intercellular space at 24 hpi with 
Pst
increased the resistance response of mature 
cyp71a12/cyp71a1
3 b y reducing bacterial levels in leaves. Since DHCA does not exhibit antibiofilm activity 
in vitro
and is weakly antimicrobial against 
Pst
growth 
in vitro
at concentrations quantified in IWFs, our results suggest that the mechanism of action for DHCA bioactivity against 
Pst
is not likely through direct antimicrobial activity. Our results also suggest that DHCA, IANconjugates, or other precursors are transported to the intercellular space in response to bacterial invasion in 
<tp:taxon-name>

This was repeated approximately three times per sample until leaves were thoroughly infiltrated (darkened transparent color throughout and negative buoyancy). Excess surface liquid was removed by blotting and the leaves were again weighed.

, or MeOD. Bulk solvent removal was performed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. For reactions with solvent volumes under 3 mL, the solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. Column chromatographic purification was performed using Silicycle silica gel (40–63 μM, 230–400 mesh) with technical grade solvents. Yields are reported for spectroscopically pure compounds, unless stated otherwise. Coupling constants are recorded in Hz and chemical shifts are reported in ppm downfield of TMS. HRMS (ESI 
+
) was performed on a Waters Micromass Q-ToF Ultima Global. The synthesis of DHCA and derivatives is based on

4.5.1. Planktonic bacterial growth assays
</title>
         <p>
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of tested indolic compounds and salicylic acid were determined using the micro-dilution broth method (

). 
Pst
overnight cultures (OD 
600
= 0.2 to 0.6) were prepared for growth assays as outlined in 

in 
Hrp
-inducing minimal (HIM) liquid medium (

). Serial dilutions of compounds were prepared in ethanol (SA, camalexin) or DMSO (SA, DHCA, and DHCA analogs). 
A
series of two-fold dilutions of DHCA, SA camalexin, or DHCA analogs were prepared ranging from 
0.05 to 1 mg
/mL in HIM medium in sterile non-tissue-culture-treated 96-well microtiter plates (Corning Life Sciences). Bacterial inoculum was added to each well to obtain a final optical density value of OD 
600
= 0.05. Solvent (DMSO or ethanol) and sterile (media only) controls were included. Plates were incubated at room temperature (24–26 
◦
C) in a plate reader with shaking (Tecan Sunrise). Optical density (OD 
600
) was measured every 15 min for 68 or 72 h. The MIC was assessed visually as the lowest concentration of compound showing total bacterial growth inhibition during the mid-exponential growth phase of controls (~36 h) without killing bacteria. The MBC of each compound was determined as the lowest concentration to kill bacteria, as defined by sub-cultures from pooled wells exhibiting no bacterial growth on KB media plates without antibiotics to prevent additive interactions between compounds creating false MBC results (

). Each experiment was performed at least twice, and representative data are presented.

         <p>
To test for 
Pst
’s ability to utilize dihydrocamalexic acid (DHCA) as a carbon source or as a nitrogen and sulfur source, bacteria were grown in 
Hrp
-inducing minimal medium with DHCA as outlined in section 4.6.1 with the following alterations. To test the ability of 
Pst
to use DHCA as a carbon source, bacteria were incubated with DHCA in HIM medium without a carbon source (lacking fructose). To test for ability of 
Pst
to use DHCA as a nitrogen and/or sulfur source, bacteria were incubated with DHCA in HIM medium without a nitrogen and sulfur source (lacking ammonium sulphate).

cells was quantified using the method developed by O’ 

. Cultures, compounds, and microtiter plates were prepared as outlined in section 4.6.1. Plates were incubated without shaking in darkness at room temperature (24–26

At 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h, plates were rinsed thoroughly in water to remove planktonic bacteria, incubated with 0.1% crystal violet for 10 min to stain biofilm, rinsed to remove extra strain and any planktonic bacteria remaining, and left overnight to dry. To de-stain for biofilm quantification, plates were incubated with 30% acetic acid (200 μl per well) for 15 min. Optical density (OD 
570
) was recorded on a plate reader (Biotek Synergy 2). Each experiment was repeated twice, and representative data are presented.

&lt;
0.05, Tukey’ s HSD or Dunnett’ s MCT) statistical analyses were performed in Metaboanalyst 3.1 (www.metaboanalyst.ca; 

), R, and Prism 9.0 (GraphPad). One-way ANOVA was used to determine statistically significant differences in bacterial levels 
in planta
with normality and homogeneity of variance assessed by the Sharpio-Wilk test and Levene’ s test. Means with unequal variances were log-transformed before analysis. Tukey’ s HSD post hoc test was used for comparisons (p 
&lt;
