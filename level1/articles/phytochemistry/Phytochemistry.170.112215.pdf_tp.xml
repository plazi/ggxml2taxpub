Acyclotides are plant-based, acyclic miniproteins with cystine knot motif formed by three conserved disulfide linkages and lack head to tail ligation. Acyclotides may not necessarily be less stable, even though they lack cyclic backbone, as the conserved cystine knot feature provides the required stability. Violacin A was the first acyclotide, isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola odorata
</tp:taxon-name>
in 2006. Until now, acyclotides have been reported from five dicot families (
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cucurbitaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Solanaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) and one monocot family (
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
). In 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, only acyclotides have been found whereas in dicot families both cyclotides and acyclotides have been isolated. In last 15 years, several acyclotides with antimicrobial, cytotoxic and hemolytic bioactivities have been discovered. Thus, although many naturally expressed acyclotides do exhibit bioactivities, the linearization of the cyclic peptides may result in loss of bioactivities.
</p>
         <p>Although, bioactivities of acyclotides are comparable to their cyclic counterparts, the numbers of isolated acyclotides are still few. Further, those discovered, have the scope to be screened for agriculturally important activities (insecticidal, anti-helminthic, molluscicidal) and pharmaceutical properties (anticancer, anti-HIV, immuno-stimulant). The feasibility of application of acyclotides is because of their relatively less complex biological synthesis compared to cyclotides, as the cyclization step is not needed. This attribute facilitates the production of transgenic crops and/or its expression in heterologous organisms, lacking cyclization machinery. Keeping in view the bioactivities and the wide array of emerging potential applications of acyclotides, the present review discusses their distribution in plants, gene and protein structure, biosynthesis, bioactivities and mechanism of action. Further, their potential applications and future perspectives to exploit them in agriculture and pharmaceutical industries have been highlighted.</p>

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Cyclotides are plant derived macrocyclic, bioactive mini-proteins with a characteristic head-to-tail cyclized backbone and a knotted arrangement of three cross-linked disulfide bonds. The first cyclotide, kalata B1 was discovered from the plant 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oldenlandia affinis
(Rubiaceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
by Dr. Lorents Gran in 1970. After more than 20 years of its discovery, the three-dimensional structural details were revealed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) studies (

). The decade of 1990s witnessed discovery of several more similar cyclized proteins from 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
families, which led to formal introduction of the name "cyclotides" to describe the family of these cyclized miniproteins consisting of 27–37 amino acids (

). Cyclotides have been found to be exceptionally stable proteins and resilient to heat, enzymes and chemical degradation (

). This stability is attributed to their cyclic cystine knot (CCK) structure formed by three disulphide linkages and cyclized backbone. Cyclotides play a role in defense of plants as revealed by their insecticidal activity (

; 

; 

; 

), anti-helminthic (

, 2009) and molluscicidal activities (

; 

). Besides their role in plants, cyclotides exhibit diverse range of bioactivities such as uterotonic (

), antibacterial (

; 

); anti-HIV (

), anticancer (

) and immuno-stimulants (

) which makes them important in pharmaceutical research.
</p>
         <p>
Cyclotides were known to exist in cyclic 
<tp:taxon-name>form only</tp:taxon-name>
, till the discovery and isolation of the acyclic violacin A from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Viola odorata
</tp:taxon-name>
(

) The naturally occurring acyclic forms are termed 'acyclotides' (

), 'linear cyclotides' or 'uncyclotides' (

), as they possess an overall conserved cystine knot structure of the cyclotides with the typical three conserved disulphide linkages, except that they lack end to end ligation. According to 

, the term 'acyclotide' is most appropriate as it is unambiguous (as per the nomenclature of organic compounds) and conveys only one meaning (i.e. not cyclic). Therefore, the term 'acyclotide' will be used for acyclic forms and 'cyclotide' will be used for cyclized forms, throughout the manuscript.

The first indication of existence of acyclotides was the presence of putative cyclotide domain identified in maize plant of 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family (

). It was observed that gene 
Umi11
from maize plant, which got upregulated during pathogenic infection had a sequence similar to that of a cyclotide gene. This sequence lacked the terminal codon for aspartic acid (D)/asparagine (N) at the C-terminal end, crucial for cyclization, thus indicating the 
Umi 11
as a putative acyclotide gene. The first acyclotide to be isolated was violacin A (

). Later, more such acyclotides have been isolated (
Table 1
) from all the angiosperm families in which cyclotides are also found (

). These acyclotides were found to be structurally as stable as the cyclotides because of cystine knot structure but are susceptible to exoprotease activity because of lack of head to tail cyclization (

). Although acyclotides lack peptide stability in terms of enzymatic degradation, they exhibit different bioactivities such as antimicrobial, cytotoxicity and hemolytic making them potential molecules for pharmaceutical and agricultural industries (

; 

). Of particular interest is the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(with crops like wheat, rice and maize which cater to the diet of world population) where only acyclotides have been discovered. As cyclotides are known to have potent pesticidal activity and role in plant defense pathways, it is worthwhile to explore these activities in all economically important 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
members, thus opening opportunities for agriculture biotechnology and pest management. Consequently, harvesting large quantities of acyclotides for application in these areas is a major pre-requisite. Bulk production of acyclotides by overexpression in a heterologous host or chemical synthesis is less complex and more feasible compared to synthesis of cyclotides as the cyclization step is not required.

A year-wise literature search for articles on PubMed with keywords 'cyclotides' and 'acyclotides or linear cyclotides', indicates a much lower number of articles on acyclotides compared to those of cyclotides (
Fig. 1
). Although the importance of investigating acyclotides has been lately recognized, the number of publications are still low. To the best of our knowledge, there is no review article which provides comprehensive information on acyclotides. Keeping this in view and the emerging potential applications of acyclotides, this review presents an overview of their distribution, structure, biosynthesis, bioactivities and mechanism of action. Further, the potential pharmaceutical and agricultural applications of acyclotides along with their future perspectives have also been discussed.

2. Distribution of acyclotides in plants
</title>
         <p>
In the last 25 years, more than 400 cyclotides including acyclotides have been isolated from various plants (https://www.cybase.org.au; 

). Till now approximately 60 species from six families (
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Solanaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cucurbitaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) have been identified for the presence of cyclotides and acyclotides. Compared to the total number of angiosperm species, the number of species from which cyclotides and acyclotides have been isolated is very low. Cyclotides and acyclotides have been isolated most abundantly from 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(317), followed by 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(85), 
<tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(76), 
<tp:taxon-name>Solanaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(12), 
<tp:taxon-name>Cucurbitaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(11) and 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(9) (https://www.cybase.org.au; 

, 

; 

; 

; 

; 

). Currently approximately 55 acyclotides have been identified across the six angiosperm families (data compiled by authors from Cybase - a database of cyclic proteins and research papers, 
Table 1
). Along with the list of acyclotides, the plants from where they have been isolated, subfamily and bioactivities are presented in 
Table 1
. Of the 55 acyclotides, 24 are found as acyclic analogues of cyclotides, present along with their respective cyclotides in the plants and 31 exist only in acyclic forms without their cyclic counterparts (
Table 1
).

         <p>

Fig. 2
shows the proportion of acyclotides and cyclotides in the six angiosperm families. Acyclotides are found most abundantly in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family and least in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Solanaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family. The number of acyclotides in the dicot families is much less compared to cyclotides. However, in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(monocot) family, only acyclotides have been reported (

). Nine acyclotides were isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Panicum laxum
</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family, whose cyclized forms were not detected (

) revealed that the putative cyclotide-like genes lack the crucial terminal residue (D/N) essential for cyclization, indicating that they probably code for acyclotides only (

). 

proposed that genes coding acyclotides appeared earlier in the evolutionary timescale 
viz
before the divergence of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. Subsequently, the monocots did not evolve further to include cyclization process of the acyclotides whereas dicotyledonous plants (the asterids and rosids) accomodated the mutation (i.e insertion of D/N) which plays a key role in cyclization. Also, the presence of acyclotides in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants and absence of cyclotides in monocots suggest their ancient origin before the divergence of angiosperms into the two taxonomical groups (

). Further, since 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(monocots) have acyclotides only and is agriculturally the most important family, their evolutionary study will have implications in the breeding program of important crop plants such as maize, rice, wheat, sugarcane, bamboo which are cultivated at a large scale worldwide. However, it is worthwhile to note that even though bioinformatics analysis suggests that the genomes of 

<tp:taxon-name>Z. mays</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>O. sativa</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>T. aestivum</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>H. vulgare</tp:taxon-name>
,

contain acyclotides-like gene sequences (

), no acyclotides have been isolated from these 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
members. Till date, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Panicum laxum
</tp:taxon-name>
, is the only 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
member, where acyclotides have been reported. Hence, to be able to comment more emphatically on the distribution status of acyclotides in 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
and subsequently monocots, more members of 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
/monocots need to be screened for acyclotides and/or cyclotides.

3. Gene architecture
</title>
         <p>
There are two categories of genes that encode for cyclotides as well as acyclotides: i) genes dedicated to encode cyclotides or acyclotides (in 
<tp:taxon-name>Cucurbitaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Solanaceae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
members); ii) albumin 1gene (composed of albumin 1a and albumin 1b domains) where the albumin 1b-chain is replaced by a cyclotide or acyclotide domain as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(

; 

). The genes that encode acyclotides exclusively, have a stop codon that replaces the codon of D/N at the C-terminal end of the acyclotide domain (

; 

). However, there are also naturally occurring acyclotides (acyclic analogues) that coexist with their respective cyclotides in the same plant such as kalata B9 and kalata B10 (

). The genes encoding such acyclotides have codon for D/N instead of the stop codon, at the C-terminal. 
Figure. 3
shows the multiple sequence alignment of some acyclotides with stop codons and other acyclic analogues of cyclotides with D/N residue at the C-terminal.
</p>
         <p>
Genes of acyclotides of all six families (
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Solanaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Cucurbitaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) show the common domains 
viz
. ER (endoplasmic reticulum) signal domain and the acyclotide domain (
Fig. 4
). The N-terminal propeptide (NTPP) domain is present in all six families except 
<tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae</tp:taxon-name>
. An additional N-terminal repeat (NTR) domain is reported in some acyclotides of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
families. Genes encoding acyclotides (acyclic hedyotides and chassatides) of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
are with and without the NTR domain respectively (
Fig. 4
). A CTR (C-terminal repeat) domain is also present in the acyclotide genes of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae</tp:taxon-name>
families (

; 

). The gene of the acyclotide violacin A has two stop codons present on either side of the CTR domain (

). Acyclotide genes of 
<tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae</tp:taxon-name>
also have an additional albumin gene 1, chain A (A1a) domain following the linker sequence (

; 

). 
<tp:taxon-name>Cucurbitaceae</tp:taxon-name>
has the most distinct gene architecture (
Fig. 4
) with a peculiar arrangement of multidomain cyclotide regions preceding the C-terminal propeptide (CTPP) domain, which is followed by an acyclotide domain (

).
</p>
         <p>
In 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, the cDNAs encoding acyclotides may also have one or more cyclotide domains, whereas in other families cDNAs with only one acyclotide domain have been reported (

). In 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, cDNA clones of acyclotides (some acyclic hedyotides and chassatides) have premature stop codons (

, 2012). In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hedyotis biflora
</tp:taxon-name>
of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, the, full-length clone (
HBC2
) of the acyclotide, hedyotide B2 has NTR domain between NTPP and main acyclotide domain similar to that of 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
and resembles the gene organization of 
HBC1
(the full-length clone of cyclotide, hedyotide B1). The cDNA clones of acyclic chassatides from 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family are exceptions as they have shorter gene length than the other 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
acyclotides due to the absence of NTR domain and short NTPP domain (

). Thus, the genes of acyclic chassatides (
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) are more similar to the acyclotides of 
<tp:taxon-name>Solanaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family as compared to acyclic hedyotides of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
. Acyclic chassatides and hedyotide B2 (
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) are the only acyclotide genes which have an intron present in the ER signal domain (
Fig. 4
) (

).
</p>
         <p>
Acyclotides of 
<tp:taxon-name>Solanaceae</tp:taxon-name>
have similar gene architecture as that of the cyclotides of this family, 
viz
, comprising of an ER signal domain, a short NTPP region, one acyclotide domain, and a six-residue C-terminal tail sequence. The only difference is the absence of a CTR domain in the precursor, as a stop codon truncates the sequence immediately after the main acyclotide domain (

). The acyclotides from the plant 
<tp:taxon-name>
Clitoria ternatea
(Fabaceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
have also been referred to as acyclic cliotides (

, 2016). The genes encoding these cliotides have similar structure but are different from all other plant families; with one ER signal domain followed by one main acyclic cliotide domain which has replaced Albumin 1b knottin domain (

; 

). Flanking the acyclic cliotide domain, is a linker region followed by an albumin 1a domain (
Fig. 4
). There are no NTPP and NTR domains. 

reported cyclization-competent cyclotide precursor genes (cTc6, cTc7, cTc10, cTc19, cTerA) from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Clitoria ternatea
</tp:taxon-name>
which encodes cliotides (cyclic forms) along with their acyclic analogues.
</p>
         <p>
In 
<tp:taxon-name>Cucurbitaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family, both acyclotides and cyclotides are encoded on the same transcript (
Fig. 4
). Such genes with multiple domains are called 
TIP-TOP
genes and were discovered in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Momordica cochinchinensis
(
Mylne et al., 2012
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. These genes have ER signal and NTPP domains followed by 2–5 mature cyclotide domains and a terminal acyclotide domain preceded by CTPP domain (

). Each cyclotide domain is preceded by NTR domain and followed by CTR domain (
Fig. 4
). In 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, till now only acyclotides have been isolated and identified from the plant 
<tp:taxon-name>
Panicum laxum
</tp:taxon-name>
and based on the genus, are termed panitides (

). Analysis of their gene architecture showed that they have an intronless ER signal domain, a NTPP region and a main panitide domain ending with a stop codon at C-terminal end (
Fig. 4
).

4. Protein structure
</title>
         <p>
Structurally, cyclotides can be categorized into three main subfamilies: Möbius, bracelet and trypsin inhibitors (

; 

). Most acyclotides also group into one of these three subfamilies. Of the listed 55 acyclotides, 24 are bracelet 
type
, 18 Möbius 
type
, 9 Möbius-like and four are from trypsin inhibitor (TI) subfamily (
Table 1
). The Möbius 
type
has a 
cis
-amide bond with proline residue in loop 5 that causes a twist in the backbone; bracelet 
type
has no twist in the backbone and trypsin inhibitors have sequences markedly different from both Möbius and bracelet 
types
but have the same cystine knot. 
Besides
these, there are acyclotides (panitides) which are categorized under 
Möbius-like
subfamily because glycine replaces proline of loop 5 and brings about a twist in the protein structure (

). 
The
acyclotides have six loops and the same cystine linkages (CI–CIV, CII-CV) threaded by CIII-CVI (

), as in the cyclotides (

). 
Loop
analysis of all 55 cyclotides showed that loop 1 and loop 2 have consistently three and four amino acids respectively, except the trypsin inhibitors (MCoTI-3, MCoTI-5, MCoTI-6, 
Mobi
6) which have 6 amino acids in loop 1, and 5 amino acids in loop 2. 
Loop
4 has one amino acid only. 
Loops
3, 5 and 6 have a variable number and diverse amino acids. 
Even
though the loop sizes vary in different acyclotides because of sequence length variation, the overall structure remain the same because of the three conserved disulfide linkages common to cyclotides and acyclotides.
</p>
         <p>
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) structures of only two acyclotides 
viz
. violacin A (PDB: 2FQA, subfamily: Möbius) and MCoTI-5 (PDB: 2LJS, subfamily: TI), are deposited in Protein Data Bank (

; 

). The amino acid sequences of these two acyclotides are very different but they have a similar overall topology because of the three conserved disulfide bonds forming the typical cystine knot structure. 

by NMR studies have revealed that structures of violacin A (acyclotide) and kalata B1(cyclotide) share the same topology. The three-dimensional structures of acyclotides overlaid on cyclotide show a good fit with only a slight distortion at the terminals (

; 

). Also, disulfide mapping of acyclotide, panitide L3 from 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
showed that it has a similar cystine knot arrangement as that of cyclotides (

). Although the sequence homology between different acyclotides and cyclotides may be low (

; 

; 

), cystine spacing amongst them is similar resulting in the typical cystine knot structure.
</p>
         <p>
Even though the acyclotides lack cyclic backbone, their stability or flexibility may be comparable to the cyclotides because, it is the three conserved disulfide linkages (forming cystine knot structure) that play a more important role in structural stability than cyclic topology (

; 

). The secondary structure of the acyclotides MCoTI-5 and violacin A has a β-sheet motif. In violacin A, residues 21, 22, 25 and 26 form β-sheet while residues 17, 18 and 23, 24 
<tp:taxon-name>form two</tp:taxon-name>
β-turns (

). In violacin A, loop 2 has been observed to contribute to the flexibility of the acyclotide (

).

5. Biosynthesis of acyclotides
</title>
         <p>
Studies describing biosynthesis of acyclotides per se are few (

; 

; 

; 

) compared to those of cyclotides (

; 

; 

; 

; 

). However, as the structure and folds of acyclotides are similar to that of cyclotides, the initial processing pathway of acyclotides may be similar to the cyclotides. The cyclotides are known to be synthesized by a multistep process which starts with transcription, ribosomal translation of precursor proteins, transport to ER, disulphide folding, cleavage and finally cyclization (

). The natural processing of cyclotides in plants involves oxidization of disulphide bonds in the precursor protein within the ER followed by cleavage and cyclization of cyclotide domain in the vacuole, further along the secretory pathway (

; 

). Presence of the processing enzyme (asparaginyl endopeptidase, AEP), which recognizes the conserved C-terminal D/N residue in the vacuolar compartment, gives evidence of cyclization in the vacuole (

). The enzyme AEP functions for both cleavage of the precursor protein (propeptide) and cyclization at the C-terminal residue D or N (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
In case of acyclotides, they exist as acyclic analogues of cyclotides (eg kalata B9, kalata B10; 

), or without any cyclic forms (eg panitides; 

) (see 
Table 1
). The biosynthesis of acyclotides without the cyclic forms such as panitides (

), acyclic chassatides (

), hedyotide B2 (

), violacin A (

), Phyb M (

) is genetically pre-determined as shown by the presence of premature stop codon or a mutation of D/N codon at the C-terminal end of acyclotide domain. The stop codon truncates the propeptide before the translation of D/N resulting in lack of cyclization. Further, in the acyclotide, hedyotide B2, it was observed that the N-terminal end of the precursor protein had a glycine residue, which was absent in mature protein. This might be either due to direct cleavage or proteolysis of the glycine residue by aminopeptidases (found in abundance in plant vacuoles) due to lack of protection in the acyclotide, unlike that in a cyclized protein (

). It is noteworthy that even though, all acyclic analogues of cyclotides have either D or N at C-terminal of the peptide chain, they still remain acyclic (

) and 
<tp:taxon-name>form disulfide</tp:taxon-name>
linkages to 
<tp:taxon-name>form the</tp:taxon-name>
characteristic cystine knot motif. These acyclic analogues maybe the premature cyclotides which would eventually cyclize or are acyclized forms generated by cleavage of the N-terminal and C-terminal bond by anhydrides or succinimides (

). In this regard, it remains to be investigated (i) whether the acyclotides with D/N at C-terminal end remain acyclic throughout the life cycle of plant or are converted to cyclic forms under certain biotic/ abiotic stress; (ii) why some acyclotides are observed as acyclic analogues of certain cyclotides only (24 acyclic analogues of 24 cyclotides, see 
Table 1
) and not universally.
</p>
         <p>
Recently, 

postulated that in panitides (acyclotides of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. laxum
</tp:taxon-name>
), the ER signal sequence directs the precursor protein to ER for folding. However, the role of NTPP and NTR domain in biosynthesis of acyclotides is still not clearly understood (

). On the other hand, in cyclotides, the presence of only single NTPP domain even with multiple cyclotide domains suggests its negligible role in folding of the proteins (

). However, 

by their experiments using GFP in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Nicotiana benthamiana
</tp:taxon-name>
established that NTPP and NTR sequences help to lead the proteins to vacuole where cleavage of the mature cyclotide domain takes place. Until 2016, it was understood that in most cases, a mature cyclotide domain encodes for either a cyclotide or an acyclotide, but not both. This was because the cyclization process is very efficient due to which the presence of acyclotides is very rare. The acyclotides that are present throughout are normally encoded by genes lacking codon for critical D/N residue (

; 

; 

; 

). Lately, 

working on diversity of cliotides (i.e cyclotides and acyclotides from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Clitoria ternatea
</tp:taxon-name>
) found that a single cliotide gene can produce up to seven different acyclic and cyclic proteins. This is attributed to inefficient or ‘fuzzy’ bio-processing of precursor proteins by the cyclization enzyme which leads to production of both cyclotides and acyclotides from same domain.

6. Bioactivities of acyclotides
</title>
         <p>
The cyclotides have a natural role as defense molecules in plants (

). They also possess a wide range of bioactivities such as anti-HIV, antimicrobial, anti-cancer, uterotonic, antihelminthic, insecticidal and hemolytic activity (

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

; 

). In case of acyclotides, less than 50% of the discovered acyclotides have been screened for these bioactivities. Earlier experiments on linearized versions of kalata B1 showed loss of all activities upon linearization (

). Experimentally linearized cyclotides (acyclic permutants) obtained by breaking any individual peptide bond of a cyclotide, did not show its original bioactivities such as hemolytic (

) and anti-HIV activities (

). Linearized homologs of cyclotide MCoTI-II from 
<tp:taxon-name>Cucurbitaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(oMCoTI-II, oMCoTI-IIA10, oMCoTI-IIA13, oMCoTI-IIA14, oMCoTI-IIR10, oMCoTI-IIR13, oMCoTI-IIR14) showed decreased trypsin inhibiting activity compared to the cyclized forms (

). However, alanine scan of kalata B1 (where individual amino acid residues were mutated without linearizing the cyclotide) showed that more than cyclic backbone, the individual residues which alter the surface hydrophobicity of the protein are responsible for the potency of the bioactivity (

). Here it may be pointed out that unlike the acyclotides, the cyclic backbone of cyclotides, can resist thermal and enzymatic degradation in an exopeptidase environment, and therefore contribute to peptide stability and the bioactivites shown by the cyclotides (

). Later, 

showed acyclotides from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chassalia chartacea
</tp:taxon-name>
(chassatides) to have potent antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and haemolytic activities, indicating that cyclic backbone may not be essential for the bioactivity.
</p>
         <p>
The naturally occurring acyclotides which exist in the plant only in acyclic forms (

; 

) show antimicrobial, cytotoxic and/or hemolytic activity (see 
Table 1
). Thus, with caution, it may be indicated that genetically predetermined, naturally occurring acyclotides which do not coexist with their cyclic forms, have demonstrated the assessed bioactivities. On the other hand, cyclotides which are experimentally made acyclic/linearized lose the activity (

; 

). The acyclotides which coexist (with their respective cyclotides) in a plant have not been screened for any bioactivities (
Table 1
).
</p>
         <p>
Bioactivities such as insecticidal, molluscicidal, anti-helminthic, have not yet been assayed for acyclotides. Antimicrobial activity has been reported in four of the discovered acyclotides, in panitide L2 (

) and chassatides C7, C8 and C11 (

). Their level of activity varied between 2.5 μM and 8.5 μM MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration), panitide L2 being the most potent. The three acyclic chassatides (C7, C8, C11) showed stronger activity compared to the cyclic chassatides and the prototype cyclotide kalata B1 (

). The acyclotide, hedyotide B2 (from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hedyotis biflora
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Rubiaceae</tp:taxon-name>
), was found to be inactive against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (

). None of the acyclotides showing antimicrobial activity were active against gram-positive bacteria. The thick peptidoglycan layer in gram-positive bacteria might hinder the electrostatic interaction required for the antimicrobial activity of the acyclotides (

, 

).
</p>
         <p>
Cytotoxicity has been shown in twelve acyclotides (panitides L1-L8, Psyle C, chassatide C7, C8, C11) exhibiting varying degree of cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. However, the most potent ones showing half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 
50
) &lt;10 μM are, three chassatides (C7, C8, C11), five panitides (pL1, pL2, pL5, pL6, pL7) and Psyle C (

; 

, 

). Psyle C has been found to be a highly effective chemo-sensitizing agent against drug-resistant cancer cells. It causes selective membrane disruption and pore formation in cancer cells allowing the accumulation of cancer drug inside the resistant cells (

). According to 

, in case of the cyclotide, cycloviolacin O2, cytotoxic activity depends on the surface exposed amino acid residues and the intact cystine knot structure rather than the sequence between the six conserved cysteine residues. Further, the glutamic acid residue in loop 1, is crucial in maintaining the cytotoxic activity of the cyclotide. For acyclotides like chassastide C11 also, the surface exposed hydrophobic residues play a role in cytotoxicity and its potency is comparable to cyclic chassatides (

).

Three acyclotides (chassatide C7, C8 and C11) have also been reported to show strong potent hemolytic activity against human red blood cells (

). The fewer numbers of acyclotides showing hemolytic activity, might be due to only two investigations (

; 

). In violacin A, the weak hemolytic activity observed was attributed to its acyclic backbone, as other cyclotides with cyclic backbone from 
<tp:taxon-name>Violaceae</tp:taxon-name>
showed strong hemolytic activity (

). Further, experimental linearization of cyclic backbone of cyclotides have also resulted in loss of hemolytic activity (

; 

). However, on the contrary, acyclic chassatides showed potent hemolytic activity of similar degree to that of cyclic chassatides (

), indicating that lack of cyclic backbone may not be the reason for absence of hemolytic activity.

7. Mechanism of action of acyclotides
</title>
         <p>
There are fewer studies elucidating the mechanism of action of acyclotides compared to those of cyclotides. In cyclotides, their bioactivities are strongly correlated to their membrane binding ability (

). They directly interact with the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) of lipid membranes via hydrophobic interactions (

). This interaction is followed by self-polymerization and pore formation in the membrane. The activity of cyclotides is a result of combined interaction of its structure, net charge and hydrophobicity with the target membrane leading to altered membrane permeability (

; 

; 

; 

). It is reasonable to suggest that the mechanism of action of acyclotides could also be the same as they have the same structural topology as the cyclotides. Further, there are evidences to indicate that hydrophobicity of the interacting surface and net charge of acyclotides also play a role in their bioactivity. This has been demonstrated in the following studies: (i) the naturally occurring acyclotide, violacin A has reduced hemolytic activity compared to the prototype cyclotide, kalata B1 (

). However, a complete loss of hemolytic activity was observed in the acyclic permutants of kalata B1 (

). It was postulated that the high degree of hydrophobicity leads to high hemolytic activity and as violacin A is more hydrophilic than kalata B1, it has reduced activity. Thus the reduced activity of violacin A might not be due to lack of cyclized backbone but because of its reduced hydrophobicity (

). (ii) The acyclotides (chassatides C7, C8 and C11), show more hemolytic activity due to their intact hydrophobic patch (

). Their higher hydrophobicity ratio (&gt; 50%) also correlates with high cytotoxicity (

). (iii) Evidence of the impact of hydrophobicity on membranolytic activity is provided by oxidation of methionine residue of acyclic chassatide, which leads to increase of hydrophilicity and consequently loss of antimicrobial, cytotoxic and hemolytic activities (

). (iv) Electrostatic interaction between the bacterial membrane and acyclotides also play a major role in antimicrobial activity. The acyclotides and cyclotides with high net positive charge are found to be effective against microbes. In 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, the panitide L2 with +2 charge shows antimicrobial effect, while the rest of the panitides with neutral or +1 charge are inactive against the microbes (

). Similarly, neutral or negatively charged chassatides are non-antimicrobial whereas the positively charged acyclotides (chassatides C7, C8) show moderate antimicrobial activity (

).

8. Potential applications of acyclotides
</title>
         <p>
High structural stability and diverse bioactivities of acyclotides have paved the way for several potential applications (

; 

, 

). The application of acyclotides in agriculture encompasses the major crops of 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family such as rice, wheat and maize, where only acyclotide genes have been reported to express. Panitides, the acyclotides from 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family possess antimicrobial, hemolytic and cytotoxic properties (

). The bioactivities of cyclotides and acyclotides depend on their ability for membrane interaction and disruption (

), which might affect insecticidal/pesticidal activity also. The predominance of acyclotides in 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
and their molecular diversity provides an opportunity for creation of diverse insecticides, active against a broad range of insects and pests affecting important food crops like rice, wheat and maize. Therefore, as in case of cyclotides, acyclotides can also be assayed for insecticidal/pesticidal activity and can be utilized in crop protection and management through production of transgenics, expressing insecticidal acyclotides (

). Sprays containing solutions of highly stable insecticidal and antimicrobial acyclotides can also be used as green pesticides and for preservation of edible items respectively. As cattle feed mainly on grasses, inclusion of 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
members with antimicrobial acyclotides in their diet can have a positive effect on the cattle health (

). Acyclotides can also be exploited for use in pharmaceutical industries. The highly stable nature of acyclotides, makes them potential molecules for peptide-based drug designing and bioactive epitope grafting. Moreover their antimicrobial properties make them promising alternatives to antibiotic therapy (

). The acyclotide, Psyle C shows cytotoxic activity against human lymphoma cell lines and chemo-sensitization (

). Acyclotides with such properties could be used for creating anti-cancer drugs and peptide-based therapies.

9. Conclusions and future perspectives
</title>
         <p>
Acyclotides do not have a cyclic backbone, but share similar overall structure and stability of the cyclotides. Both cyclotides and acyclotides are found in five dicot families. However, until now only acyclotides have been isolated from a monocot family (
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
). The genetically pre-determined acyclotides (eg violacin A, panitides, psyle C and acyclic chassatides) lack the crucial D/N residue at the C-terminal end, which is required for cyclization. These acyclotides show diverse bioactivities resulting from its hydrophobicity and electrostatic interactions with target biological membranes. Their comparable bioactivities with prototype cyclotide kalata B1, indicate that although cyclization provides peptide stability, the cyclic backbone may not be essential for biological activities. This opens up a range of potential agricultural and pharmaceutical applications. Further, the omission of cyclization step during heterologous expression or transgenic production adds to the feasibility of its applications.
</p>
         <p>
Keeping in view the future prospects, the first noticeable fact is that, the total number of acyclotides isolated until now, is much less compared to cyclotides. Hence, to increase their numbers as well as diversity, more plants, particularly members of 
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae</tp:taxon-name>
which apparently have only acyclotides, can be screened for isolation of more acyclotides. A logical approach before proceeding for isolation would be genome mining/transcriptome analysis using appropriate bioinformatics tools to search for putative acyclotide genes in the available plant genome sequences. This would also require developing bioinformatics search tools for identification of acyclotide genes in plant genomes. Considering the antimicrobial, cytotoxic and hemolytic activities of some acyclotides, more numbers should be assayed to obtain acyclotides with increased potency. Further, other bioactivities such as insecticidal, pesticidal, molluscicidal, anticancer, immunomodulatory and other pharmaceutical activities need to be explored. Although some clues on mechanism of action of acyclotides is available, more investigation is required to establish exact mechanisms. This can facilitate screening and identifying potentially bioactive acyclotides by 
in silico
methods like docking and simulations. Acyclotides do not need cyclization machinery, so their feasibility of transgenic expression for pesticidal activity in agriculturally important plants lacking cyclotides and cyclization machinery is an attractive proposition. Another focus of investigation would be their bulk production by heterologous expression in bacterial cells for agricultural (eg insecticidal sprays) and pharmaceutical (eg peptide-based drugs) purposes which is relatively simpler due to exclusion of cyclization step.
