Glucosinolates are found in plants of the order 
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicales</tp:taxon-name>
and hydrolyzed to different breakdown products, particularly after tissue damage. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Barbarea vulgaris
R.Br.
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicaceae</tp:taxon-name>
), the dominant glucosinolate in the investigated “G-type” is glucobarbarin, (
S
)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethylglucosinolate. Formation of the nitrile from glucobarbarin was observed 
in vitro
, while a previously suggested thioamide (synonym thionamide) was not confirmed. Resedine (5-phenyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one) was detected after glucobarbarin hydrolysis in crushed 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
leaves and siliques, but not in intact parts. The abundance increased for several hours after completion of hydrolysis. The corresponding 1,3- oxazolidine-2-thione (OAT), with the common name barbarin, was also formed, and appeared to be the precursor of resedine. Addition of each of two non-endogenous OATs, (
S
)-5-ethyl-5-methylOAT and (
R
)-5-vinylOAT (
R
-goitrin), to a leaf homogenate resulted in formation of the corresponding 1,3- oxazolidin-2-ones (OAOs), confirming the metabolic connection of OAT to OAO. Formation of OAOs was inhibited by prior brief heating of the homogenate, suggesting enzyme involvement. We suggest the conversion of OATs to OAOs to be catalyzed by an enzyme (“oxazolidinethionase”) responsible for turnover of OAT formed in intact plants. Resedine had been reported as an alkaloid from another species - 
<tp:taxon-name>
Reseda luteola
</tp:taxon-name>
L. (
<tp:taxon-name>Resedaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) - naturally containing the glucosinolate glucobarbarin. However, resedine was not detected in intact 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. luteola
</tp:taxon-name>
plants, but formed after tissue damage. The formation of resedine in two families suggests a broad distribution of putative OATases in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicales</tp:taxon-name>
; potentially involved in glucosinolate turnover that needs myrosinase activity as the committed step. In agreement with the proposed function of OATase, several candidate genes for myrosinases in glucosinolate turnover in intact plants were discovered in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
genome. We also suggest that biotechnological conversion of OATs to OAOs might improve the nutritional value of 
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicales</tp:taxon-name>
protein. HPLC-MS/MS methods for detection of these glucobarbarin products are described.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
1,3-Oxazolidin-2-ones (OAOs) are important as structural elements in modern antibiotics, the first of which was linezolid targeting bacterial protein synthesis (

). Likewise, several OAOs are important as auxiliaries in chiral synthesis (

). They are also known as Evans auxiliaries and used for controlling aldol reactions (

). In this report, we argue that this class of compounds is also formed from enzymatic turnover of glucosinolates, a group of natural 
S
-glucosides (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
It is well known that a related group of heterocycles, the substituted 1,3-oxazolidine-2-thiones (OATs), are found in many glucosinolate-containing plants. Both OAOs and OATs are named as deriving from the parent heterocycle azolidine (
Fig. 1
), explaining the middle ‘A’ in our abbreviations. Penicillin contains a third pattern, a thiazolidine ring (
Fig. 1
). Natural diversity of heterocyclic secondary metabolites was studied by several researchers, inspired by the remarkable progress in penicillin chemistry in the first half of the 20th century. Two reports independently showed that OATs were formed via cyclisation of 
b
-hydroxyalkyl isothiocyanates produced from 
b
-hydroxyalkyl glucosinolates (

; 

). For example, (
R
)-5-phenylOAT (( 
R
)-barbarin, 
2
) is formed via a never isolated 
b
-hydroxy isothiocyanate derived from (
S
)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethylglucosinolate (glucobarbarin, 
1
) (
Fig. 2
) (

; Agerbirk and Olsen, 2015). The enantiomer, (
S
)-barbarin, is formed from the epimeric glucosinolate epiglucobarbarin (

). Benzyl-activating substitution of glucobarbarins change the 
type
of hydrolysis product to a 1,3-thiazolidin-2-one (TAO), an additional heterocycle in this plant group (
Fig. 1
) (Agerbirk and Olsen, 2015). Recently, 5- phenylTAO was also detected at low levels after fractionation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
extracts, but not in initial analysis of the extract (

), perhaps indicating very low levels or formation as an artifact. Indeed, a thermally induced rearrangement of 5- phenylOAT to 5-phenylTAO is also well established (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Glucosinolates are found throughout the order 
<tp:taxon-name>
Brassicales (
Blazevic et al., 2015
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, with around 144 documented structures reported by 2016 (

; 

; 

; Agerbirk et al., 2015; 

; 

; 

) and a further reported 3‾5 structures from 2017, including (the isothiocyanate corresponding to) 5- phenylpentylglucosinolate (

) and 4-hydroxy-3,5- dimethoxybenzylglucosinolate (

). Although some structural features seem to be restricted to smaller taxonomic groups, there is also a great redundancy in structures found in widely separated taxonomic groups (

; 

). A widespread structural feature is 
b
-hydroxylation of the glucosinolate side-chain catalyzed by GS-OH enzymes (

; 

; 

; 

). Indeed, the 
b
-hydroxylated glucosinolate glucobarbarin (
1
) is found in 
<tp:taxon-name>Resedaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Reseda luteola
</tp:taxon-name>
L.) (

; 

) as well as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g. most or all 
<tp:taxon-name>
Barbarea
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
and some accessions of watercress, 

<tp:taxon-name>Nasturtium</tp:taxon-name>
of 
fi
- cinale

R.Br) (

; 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
From 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. luteola
</tp:taxon-name>
, two alkaloids were described in an early report (

). One was a substituted OAT, while the other was a substituted OAO, a further heterocyclic ring in the order 
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicales</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. 1
). The OAT was named resedinine, but was identical to barbarin. Hence the older name has priority, and the name resedinine should be abandoned. The OAO was named resedine (
3
) and identified as 5-phenylOAO (
Fig. 2
). Relations to plant biochemistry or glucosinolate turnover were not investigated.
</p>
         <p>
Of the many known OATs in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicales</tp:taxon-name>
, one has received particular attention: (
S
)-5-vinylOAT (( 
S
)-goitrin) formed from the glucosinolate progoitrin (( 
R
)-2-hydroxybut-3-enylglucosinolate) in oilseed rape (

). Despite decades of breeding efforts to lower levels of progoitrin and goitrin (

), these metabolites remain a limiting factor for the use of protein from oilseed rape in fodder. Some of the antinutritional effects of goitrin and other OATs seem to be related to disturbance of iodine metabolism and catalysis of nitrite reactions in mammals (reviewed in 

; 

). A recent investigation has broadened the range of known effects of OATs (

).
</p>
         <p>
Glucosinolate hydrolysis is catalyzed by isoenzymes of thioglucoside glucohydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.147) commonly known as myrosinases. Myrosinase-catalyzed complete turnover of glucosinolates happens after tissue disruption, and is caused by the mixing of enzyme and substrate that were spatially separated in intact plants (Wittstock et al., 2016a; b). Classical myrosinases of the “TGG” group were for many years regarded as the sole enzymes catalyzing this reaction. However, other myrosinases responsible for turnover of glucosinolates in intact plants have been identified in recent years (

; Wittstock et al., 2016a; b). Some unexpected, non-conventional degradation products have been reported, suggesting a varied and complex metabolism of glucosinolates in intact plants (

; 

; 

; 

; 

). To our knowledge, nothing is known of metabolism or detoxification of OATs in intact plants.
</p>
         <p>
From non-enzymatic breakdown of glucobarbarin and progoitrin catalyzed by high concentrations of ferrous salts, thioamides were reported in high yields, on the base of limited analytical evidence (

; b). A later report provided circumstantial evidence (UV-spectrum of a minor chromatographic peak) for the formation of low levels of the thioamide from epiglucobarbarin at similar high ferrous ion conditions, and discussed the possibility of ferrous ion catalyzed turnover of 
b
-hydroxyalkyl glucosinolates in biological material (

).
</p>
         <p>
In order to better understand ecological functions of glucobarbarin in our main experimental plant 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
, we set out to investigate its breakdown products 
in vitro
as well as 
in vivo
. Our initial objective was to determine the biochemical hydrolysis products from glucobarbarin, expected to be barbarin, 3-hydroxy- 3-phenylpropanenitrile (
4
) and possibly the related thioamide (hypothetic “ 
5
”). However, an unexpected product with the same nominal mass as a potential thioamide fragment appeared, so an additional goal was to identify this OAO product and test for an enzymatic formation from the corresponding OAT. We here report lack of formation of a thioamide, scarce formation of the nitrile, and unexpected formation of OAOs via OATs catalyzed by a heat sensitive factor in glucobarbarin-containing plants. The formation of the OAO, resedine (
3
), is characterized and the connection to glucosinolate turnover investigated.

2.1. Identi 
fi
cation of the nitrile from glucobarbarin hydrolysis

</title>
         <p>
One glucobarbarin product, barbarin (
2
), was already at hand, and ion trap HPLC-MS was optimized for detection in the relevant mass range for glucobarbarin products (Section 3.6). In order to obtain the nitrile from glucobarbarin, the isolated glucosinolate was subjected to myrosinase-catalyzed hydrolysis in a well-defined 
in vitro
system at pH 
5 in
the presence and absence of 2.5 mM of a ferrous salt, FeSO 
4
. As expected, both barbarin and a product with mass spectrum matching the expected nitrile (
4
) were formed at both conditions, with barbarin dominating without added FeSO 
4
and the nitrile 
4
dominating with added FeSO 
4
(
Fig. 3
).
</p>
         <p>
A previously suggested thioamide (hypothetic “ 
5
”) was searched for but not detected (
Fig. 3
). Resedine (
3
) and an amide (
8
), discussed below, were not detected either. The ion trap MS of 
4
was dominated by the sodium adduct and a proton adduct after loss of water, while the proton adduct itself was minor (
Fig. 4a
). By comparison with two related model compounds, we could confirm that such loss of water was predictable for 
4
because of the 
b
-position of the hydroxyl group. The phenolic isomer 
6
lost water to a much lower extent in ion trap MS (
Fig. 4b
), while association of both hydroxyl substitutions (
7
) led to complete loss of water from the proton adduct due to the activating effect of the 
p
-hydroxyl group (
Fig. 4c
). Using a higher resolution QqToF MS, we confirmed the identity of 
4
(found: 130.0649 [M-H 
2
OþH] 
þ
, calculated for C 
9
H 
8
N 
þ
: 130.0651). As 
1
was precursor and ferrous salts are well known to stimulate nitrile formation from glucosinolate hydrolysis, the structure of product 
4
was ascertained as 
4
(3-hydroxy-3- phenylpropanenitrile).
</p>

2.2. Amide but no thioamide detected from in vitro, non-enzymatic 
glucobarbarin breakdown with a ferrous salt
</p>
         <p>
We were intrigued by the historical report of 3-hydroxy-3- phenylpropanethioamide (hypothetic “ 
5
”) from glucobarbarin at high ferrous salt concentrations (

) and a tentative later confirmation (

). In an attempt to obtain a reference, the reported procedure (

) was repeated with slight modifications (Section 3.5). Extensive glucobarbarin degradation (92%) after incubation at 15 mM with 150 mM ferrous ammonium sulfate was confirmed by HPLC-analysis (
Fig. 5A
). However, product analysis by HPLC-DAD did not reveal any peak matching the suggested thioamide with 
ƛ
max
at 
267 nm
(

). After extraction with ethyl acetate, the two major products absorbing at 
210 nm
(
Fig. 5B
) were isolated by HPLC and identified as 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanamide (
8
, tentative) and the nitrile 
4
by ion trap HPLC-MS/MS and HPLC-QqToF-MS. Formed along with a nitrile, the amide 
8
was considered a reasonable structure, as it can be likened to hydrated nitrile. In the ion trap with eluents doped with NaCl, the sodium adduct was dominant (
Fig. 5C
). The suggested identity was supported by QqToF-MS (found: 166.0866 [MþH] 
þ
, calculated for 
8
, [C 
9
H 
12
O 
2
N] 
þ
: 166.0863). Fragmentation of the sodium adduct in ion trap MS supported the identity, as the major loss of 59 amu matched loss of acetamide, leaving an ion with the composition as a sodium adduct of benzaldehyde (
m
/ 
z
129). The hydrogen adduct detected in QqToF-MS fragmented differently, with major loss of 60 amu (acetic acid) leaving a fragment matching the composition of phenylmethaniminium ion (found: 106.0653 [M-acetic acidþH] 
þ
, calculated for C 
7
H 
8
N 
þ
: 106.0651). We find acid-catalyzed rearrangement with loss of acetic acid in agreement with the proposed structure, 
8
. Searching the data files after ion trap HPLC-MS of the entire ethyl acetate extract and six isolated peaks did not reveal any sign of the presence of the suggested thioamide “ 
5
”. Specifically, we searched for expected 
m
/ 
z
values of hypothetic “ 
5
”: 182 [MþH] 
þ
or 204 [MþNa] 
þ
or 164 [M-H 
2
OþH] 
þ
. This expected MS was based on experience with related metabolites 
4
, 
6
, 
7
and 
8
(
Figs. 4
and 
5
).
</p>
         <p>
Observation of an amide (
8
) but no thioamide (“ 
5
”) could not be explained by contamination with the reagents described later, catalyzing conversion of the thiocarbonyl functional group in OATs to the carbonyl functional group in OAOs. This could be firmly concluded for logistic reasons (Section 3.5).

         <p>
The spontaneous hydrolysis of glucosinolates in crushed 
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicales</tp:taxon-name>
plant material is termed autolysis. As the profile of non-OAT glucobarbarin hydrolysis products in green parts of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
was completely unknown, we first investigated the autolysis of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgari
</tp:taxon-name>
s foliage (upper leaves of flowering plants of the ‘G-type’ of this species, which is rich in glucobarbarin) (Agerbirk et al., 2015). As expected, the OAT barbarin (
2
) was a major autolysis product, while the nitrile (
4
) was not detected or at trace levels. Despite the complex nature of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
metabolite extracts (

; 

), the chromatograms contained only few major peaks (
Fig. 6
), probably because the ion trap was targeted at low 
m
/ 
z
values (target 
m
/ 
z
180), in practice resulting in a quasi-normal distribution of detected 
m
/ 
z
values centered around the target and leaving 
m
/ 
z
values above ca. 300 undetected (Section 3.6). With these ion trap settings, we noticed a medium intensity peak with MS2 similar to that of barbarin. As explained below, the metabolite in this peak was shown to be resedine (
3
).
</p>
         <p>
Resedine formation in 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
was detected in plant parts sampled from the investigated 2nd year plants over a period of three months, in leaves as well as in siliques. Resedine formation was also observed in dry seeds homogenized in water, and in seedlings (
Table 1
). The peak was much smaller than the barbarin peak soon after complete glucosinolate hydrolysis (at 0.5 h after crushing the plant part in a mortar), but increased in intensity over time (
Fig. 6A
). In extracts of intact foliage, resedine was not detected, while barbarin was detected at much reduced levels (around 5% of levels after intended complete autolysis), as expected for an artifact from ‘partial autolysis during handling and extraction’.
</p>
         <p>
The ion trap mass spectrum of barbarin is characteristic, with major losses of CSO and H 
2
S (
Fig. 6C
). The metabolite proving to be resedine showed the same fragments as barbarin, whereas the molecular ions [MþH] 
þ
and [MþNa] 
þ
had 
m
/ 
z
values 16 amu lower than those of barbarin (
Fig. 6D
). It seemed obvious that this metabolite was related to barbarin, but with the sulfur replaced by oxygen resulting in losses of CO 
2
and H 
2
O rather than CSO and H 
2
S. Indeed, the UV band from C=S at 
242 nm
in barbarin was missing (Supplementary 
Fig. 1
). For NMR analysis, resedine was isolated by HPLC from foliage autolyzed for 24 h (Supplementary 
Fig. 2
). The proton NMR spectrum, with a complex cluster of resonances from the phenyl group in the 7.37‾7.44 ppm interval, and three coupled signals of H5 (5.64 ppm, apparent t), H4a (3.98 ppm, apparent dt) and H4b (3.54, ddd) was in excellent agreement with literature spectra (

; 

). First order analysis was not possible, but PERCH analysis confirmed the interpretation and provided accurate chemical shifts and coupling constant values (Supplementary 
Fig. 3
). The QqToF-MS confirmed also the interpretations above of MS2 fragmentation, with major losses of H 
2
O and CO 
2
from the proton adduct. The ion trap HPLC-MS of resedine also agreed with a synthetic specimen prepared from 
2
at oxidizing conditions, using H 
2
O 

2
in

a procedure simplified and scaled down from the literature (Section 3.12).
</p>
         <p>
Literature search revealed that 
3
was a known natural product reported as an alkaloid from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. luteola
</tp:taxon-name>
and hence named resedine (

). Extraction and analysis of that plant species showed that resedine was not detectable in intact foliage, but was a medium-abundance peak after autolysis (
Fig. 6B
, 
Table 1
). We also searched old data files (

) from analysis of autolysis products of glucobarbarin in watercress, 

N. of 
fi
cinale

, and observed a peak with the four characteristic ions of resedine, reasonable 
tR
compared to barbarin, and lacking in extracts without autolysis (Supplementary 
Fig. 4
). We concluded that resedine is formed after autolysis, possibly as a downstream glucobarbarin product (
Fig. 6 AþB
), in at least three 
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicales</tp:taxon-name>
species, but is not a major metabolite in intact tissue of any of the species.
</p>
         <p>

2.4. Only traces of nitrile and no amide or thioamide as autolysis 
product
</p>
         <p>
The nitrile, detected with certainty from 
in vitro
breakdown of glucobarbarin by myrosinase as well as with a ferrous salt, was not detected with certainty in any of our autolysis experiments. The low amounts reported in 
Table 1
are maximum estimates calculated from minor or trace peaks, of which none were confirmed by MS2. However, the spectrum of putative 
4
from seedlings showed good resemblance with the reference spectrum. As some plants convert nitriles into amides enzymatically (

), we also searched the autolysis extracts for the corresponding amide 
8
. A trace was detected in all analyzed samples after autolysis, but an equally abundant trace was also detected in many samples before autolysis and in a species (
<tp:taxon-name>
Reseda odorata
</tp:taxon-name>
L.) not containing glucobarbarin. The identity of the putative 
8
could not be ascertained by MS 
2 in
any sample due to very low levels. Hence, we concluded that the amide 
8
, if present at all, was a low level constituent not derived from glucobarbarin breakdown during autolysis.
</p>
         <p>
Inspired by the 
in vitro
stimulation of nitrile formation by a ferrous salt (Section 2.1.), an equivalent level of FeSO 
4
was added to a leaf before homogenization (
Table 1
). However, a slight possible increase of nitrile formation in one experiment was far less than in the 
in vitro
experiment, suggesting that other binding sites competed for ferrous ion in the homogenate.
</p>
         <p>
In systematic attempts to detect the historically claimed thioamide from glucobarbarin degradation, we searched chromatograms of autolysis samples with and without added ferrous salt for the expected 
m
/ 
z
values of hypothetic “ 
5
”. However, no candidate peak was found, except that the expected loss-of-water fragment mass (
m
/ 
z
164) matched resedine (
3
) discussed above. We also analyzed samples with HPLC-DAD and searched manually UV traces at 
267 nm
for peaks with the reported UV spectrum, with a maximum at 
267 nm
(

), but found no candidate peaks. In general, HPLC-DAD chromatograms were complex, and 
4
and to some extent 
3
were disturbed by coeluting peaks (Supplementary 
Fig. 2
). We concluded that no conclusive evidence for a thioamide (“ 
5
”) formed from glucobarbarin has ever been reported, despite two claims, and formation of “ 
5
” could not be confirmed despite systematic attempts (Section 2.2).
</p>
         <p>
The low levels of nitrile product observed would suggest that nitrile specifier proteins are not of major importance in upper leaves, siliques and seeds of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
(
Kissen and Bones, 2009
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. Lack of an effect of an added ferrous salt supports this conclusion (

). As specifier proteins are organ specific, this conclusion cannot be generalized to all organs, and seedlings, roots and first years plants should be tested separately (Wittstock et al., 2016a; b). Formation after induction is also a possibility; nitriles and amides corresponding to products of phenethylglucosinolate (similar to glucobarbarin, but lacking the 
b
-hydroxy group) were detected after induction with CuCl 

2
in

<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
(
Pedras et al., 2015
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. However, the glucosinolate profile of the investigated 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
accession was not reported, and the tissues were extracted directly without preceding autolysis, so direct comparison with the present work is not possible.
</p>
         <p>

2.5. Time course and heat sensitivity of formation of resedine in 
crushed tissue
</p>
         <p>
The time course of formation of resedine was further investigated, hoping that it would shed light on the mechanism of formation during autolysis. When varying the autolysis time for leaves and siliques, a quasi-linear formation of resedine was observed over 3 h or more, suggesting that any needed additional reactant (other than barbarin) was continuously available in homogenized tissue (
Fig. 7A
). These experiments were carried out with individual samples of leaves or siliques, and without buffer addition. As the individual samples could vary in initial glucobarbarin concentration, the appearance of resedine could only be defined in relative terms. From the long quasi-linear phase in the undiluted homogenates, we anticipate that any co-reactant would be a simple, abundant molecule like H 
2
O or O 
2
. A hydrolysis would be the simplest reaction class, but an oxidative reaction is also a possibility.
</p>
         <p>
In order to test whether the catalyst responsible for resedine formation was heat sensitive, an additional experiment was carried out (Section 3.10). First, leaves were homogenized and incubated for 0.3 h, allowing turnover of most of the glucobarbarin to barbarin. Then, the homogenate was divided in aliquots, which were suspended in pH 7 buffer. In order to test for a heat sensitive catalyst without varying total incubation time, all suspended aliquots were incubated for an additional 25 h at room temperature, except for a brief (1 min) boiling at either 0.3 h (i.e. immediately after suspension), 6.3 h or 24.3 h (
Fig. 7B
). Hence, initial glucobarbarin levels were the same in all aliquots, and only the reaction time until boiling varied, not total incubation time or total heat exposure. While total amounts of barbarin and resedine increased slightly between 0.3 h and 6.3 h, the absolute (and also relative) levels of resedine increased in both the 6.3 h and 24.3 h aliquots relative to the 0.3 h aliquot (
Fig. 7B
). In contrast to the experiments comprising autolysis without added buffer, a quasi-linear formation of resedine was not observed. The slower formation after buffer-addition suggested the reaction rate to be very sensitive to dilution of enzyme and/or substrate. As the time until boiling was the only factor varied in the experiment, we concluded that resedine was formed by a heat sensitive catalyst, most likely an enzyme. From a structural argument, barbarin was a likely precursor. In the following, we use the provisional name oxazolidinethionase (OATase) for the hypothesized enzyme. “Thionase” would be a simpler trivial name for an enzyme converting a thiocarbonyl to a carbonyl, but this name was abandoned because it has already been used historically for another enzyme, cystathionine beta synthase, E.C. 4.2.1.22, that catalyzes an apparently unrelated reaction.

þ
) and further loss of anhydrorhamnose (

). All of this would be in accordance with dominance of

).
</p>
         <p>
It is well established that OATs are unstable at very high temperature, as found in GC instruments (

; 

). Rearrangement to TAOs was reported at GC conditions. Hence, in the experimental design, it was critical that all samples received the same heat treatment, but at different time after homogenization. Clearly, the factor determining the amount of resedine formed was not related to heat energy received, but to the reaction time allowed before heating was carried out. TAOs are detectable at our conditions (Agerbirk and Olsen, 2015), but were not observed, confirming that barbarin was stable at the moderate temperatures used here (100 
ǫC
and below).

2.6. Detection of heat-sensitive OATase acting on spiked OATs in

         </p>
         <p>
vulgaris homogenates
</p>
         <p>
Several approaches would be possible for further tests for a metabolic connection of glucobarbarin (
1
) via barbarin (
2
) to resedine (
3
). Mutants devoid of 
1
(

) were not readily available, the enzyme was apparently sensitive to dilution or extraction (
Fig. 7B
), and isotopically labelled precursors were not at hand. Instead, we tested for a more general OAT converting enzyme (OATase): two additional OATs and an OAT precursor glucosinolate were spiked to 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
homogenates, which were analyzed for the corresponding OAOs after incubation. One of them was (
S
)-5-ethyl-5-methylOAT (
9
), and conversion of this substrate to the corresponding OAO (
10
) was unequivocally demonstrated, as confirmed by the same 
tR
and ion trap MS/MS as that of an authentic standard (
Fig. 8
). This experiment, including relevant controls and testing two different OATs, is detailed below.
</p>
         <p>
Addition of the OAT 
9
did result in appreciable accumulation of the corresponding OAO 
10
(
Fig. 9AþE
), while this OAO was not seen in a control without the added OAT (
Fig. 9BþF
). In contrast, a briefly heated homogenate essentially did not catalyze conversion of added 
9
to 
10
(
Fig. 9CþG
). As a control for substrate impurities or general non-enzymatic formation of OAOs, 
9
was incubated in parallel with a pH 5 buffer. A tiny OAO peak detected in the heated controls with homogenates was also observed in the heated buffer controls, apparently due to a minor contamination of the OAT substrate used for spiking (
Fig. 9DþH
).
</p>
         <p>
The other tested OAT was (
R
)-goitrin (
11
) with the systematic name (
R
)-5-vinylOAT. Addition of (
R
)-goitrin resulted in a minor but distinct peak of the corresponding OAO 
12
(Supplementary 
Fig. 5
). The MS of the peak matched the MS of an authentic reference (Section 3.13) when background was taken into account (Supplementary 
Fig. 5
). The product peak (
12
) was confirmed to be essentially absent from a control of the substrate 
11
incubated with pH 5 buffer, in accordance with the product peak being due to enzymatic conversion in the plant material. With this substrate (
11
) and product (
12
), peak intensities were about fivefold lower than seen for 
9
and 
10
, despite the OATs 
9
and 
11
being added at similar concentration. The apparent lower sensitivity was a logical consequence of the lowered 
Mr
, considering the quite narrow focusing of the ion trap. Indeed, UV detection (Supplementary 
Fig. 6
) confirmed that both OATs were present at high levels (calculated as ca. 10 mM), comparable to the endogenous level of barbarin. So there was no evidence for different reaction rates for the two tested OATs, 
9
vs 
11
. As a further control of sufficient access of the (
R
)- goitrin spike, addition of the glucosinolate precursor of (
R
)-goitrin, epiprogoitrin, resulted in formation of goitrin 
in situ
(Supplementary 
Fig. 6
) and also of a minor peak of the corresponding OAO, 
12
.
</p>
         <p>
We concluded that a heat sensitive factor in 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
homogenates converts several OATs (
2
, 
9
and 
11
) into corresponding OAOs (
3
, 
10
and 
12
). As autolysis was going on in the homogenate before addition of the spike, and OATase activity was expected to slow down due to the experimental dilution, there was no reason to believe that formation of resedine would be significantly inhibited by one or more added OATs. Test for conversion of (
R
)-goitrin (
11
) was also relevant from an applied perspective, as 
11
is formed from epiprogoitrin in the potential industrial crop 
<tp:taxon-name>
Crambe abyssinica
Hochst. ex R. E. Fries
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) (

). The (
S
)- goitrin enantiomer was not tested in this work. An OATase enzyme capable of removing the thione functionality of (
S
)-goitrin would seem to have potential in improving the nutritional value of rapeseed (
<tp:taxon-name>
Brassica napus
</tp:taxon-name>
) protein that suffer from (
S
)-goitrin and progoitrin contamination (

; 

; 

). Clearly, the natural enantiomer of goitrin in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Brassica napus
</tp:taxon-name>
should be used for testing relevant plants for a suitable OATase.

</p>
         <p>
The biological function of putative OATase could be the observed: turnover of OATs after autolysis. However, OATase could also be involved in turnover of OAT after glucosinolate turnover in intact plants (
Fig. 2A
). The very slow formation of resedine, indicating a rather low OATase activity (initial rate around 0.2‾2 nkat/g fresh wt. estimated from data behind 
Fig. 7A
), was in contrast to the fast first step in glucobarbarin hydrolysis during autolysis. Hence, we decided to search for candidate genes for initiation of glucosinolate turnover in intact plants. Initiation would be expected to involve hydrolysis of the thioglucoside bond by a myrosinase. In addition to classical TGG myrosinases (

; Wittstock et al., 2016a; b), a number of other myrosinases have been reported in recent years. The 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
genome (

) and transcriptomes (

; 

) were mined for orthologs to genes from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Arabidopsis thaliana
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Brassica rapa
</tp:taxon-name>
known or suggested to be involved in glucosinolate turnover in intact plants (

), and used to construct a phylogenetic tree (
Fig. 10
). Two 
b
-glucosidases named “brassininassociated 
b
-glucosidase” (BABG.a and BABG.b) were both suggested to be myrosinases that can activate indole glucosinolates for biosynthesis of the indole phytoalexin brassinin in 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. rapa
(
Klein and Sattely, 2017
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. Interestingly, 
BABG
orthologs are not found in 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
while one 
BABG
ortholog was found in the

, nor from 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
(

</tp:taxon-name>
, but only limited investigations have been reported so far. But related non-indole phytoalexins are found in 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris

PEN2
and 
BABG

BGLU27
were similar to those of 
BABG
(

BGLU
genes in 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
have been suggested to code for myrosinases (

). To our knowledge, no BGLU27 has been characterized and any possible function as myrosinases remain to be studied. However, 
AtBGLU27
(At

) was strongly induced after 
<tp:taxon-name>

The field of glucosinolate turnover in intact plants is in rapid progress (

), and the genes selected for this analysis are only a subset of relevant myrosinase genes. However, the identified genes show that candidates for glucosinolate turnover in intact plants exist in 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
, although the investigated candidates are known as pathogen induced, not constitutive. Clearly, investigations of inducibility of OATase and regulation of candidate myrosinases would be relevant for assessing the suggested involvement of OATase in glucosinolate turnover. Although 
PEN2
and 
GLU27
are known as pathogen inducible genes, expression of the

B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
paralogs was detected in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
transcriptomes (
Fig. 10
). Ring-opening by hydrolysis of either the ester-like or amide-like motives in resedine is a potential further step in turnover.

2.8. Perspectives

In conclusion, resedine is formed from barbarin by a heat sensitive catalyst in crushed parts of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
, 

N. of 
fi
cinale

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. luteola
</tp:taxon-name>
, but is not detectable in intact plants. As 

N. of 
fi
cinale

is a vegetable often eaten raw, resedine will be part of human nutrition in the 
USA
where watercress containing glucobarbarin is marketed (

). We anticipate the catalyst to be an enzyme, OATase, constitutively expressed in a variety of tissues for turnover of barbarin formed 
in vivo
. The product resedine exists in two enantiomeric forms. During review of this manuscript, chiral separation of the enantiomers was achieved, and it was found that essentially one enantiomer is formed during autolysis in G-type 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
, further supporting enzymatic formation from (
R
)-barbarin (T. Yang and Agerbirk, unpublished).
</p>
         <p>
The natural diversity of glucosinolates result in a diverse palette of biological effects, and the diversity is even higher because each glucosinolate can lead to several products (

). Further structural diversity is realized whenever a new 
type
of glucosinolate product is discovered (Agerbirk and Olsen, 2015; 

; 

; 

). Indeed, turnover of OATs to OAOs could be a general reaction happening for several or all of the around 14 known 
b
-hydroxylated glucosinolate side chains (

; 

; 

). OAOs were not detected in a recent, very thorough survey of glucosinolate products in cabbages (

). However, autolysis was only allowed for 0.5 h, and 
b
-hydroxylated glucosinolates were not prominent.
</p>
         <p>
Regulation of the OATase is likely but was not tested. The reaction could be simply a detoxification involved in glucosinolate turnover, possibly allowing sulfur recycling (

). Considering the range of bioactivities of other known OAOs, the reaction could also be involved in defense (

), signaling (

) or biosynthesis. Biosynthesis of non-indole phytoalexins starting from phenethyl glucosinolates in 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
and 

N. of 
fi
cinale

has already been suggested (

; 

). As the enzyme activity was detected in two plant families, it could be a widespread enzyme involved in turnover of OATs in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicales</tp:taxon-name>
. Detoxification of contaminating OATs in cruciferous protein would be a potential industrial application of such an enzyme.
</p>
         <p>
Elemental composition and UV spectral data so far constitute the only documentation to support formation of the hypothetic thioamide product “ 
5
” from glucobarbarin (Austin et al., 1068a). However, the general formation of thioamides is better documented (

). 

reported high yields of thioamide from 
b
-hydroxylated glucosinolates but lack of thioamide from a non-hydroxylated glucosinolate, and suggested a mechanism of formation involving the hydroxy group. These authors reported 40% molar yield of the thioamide from epiprogoitrin. However, later authors (

) reported around tenfold lower yield (and the identification of the thioamide was not conclusive). Furthermore, analytical evidence (GC-MS and comparison with an authentic reference) was recently reported for formation of the thioamide from a glucosinolate lacking a hydroxy group (3-methoxybenzylglucosinolate) (

). Hence, formation of thioamides as such from glucosinolates is decently documented, but any influence of the 
b
-hydroxy group is not. Furthermore, the apparently consistent high yields in the pioneering papers (

; b) contrast with the findings of later authors. It seems as if yet unidentified factors influence the possible formation of thioamides from non-enzymatic, ferrous ion catalyzed breakdown of glucosinolates. As the disulfide of thioglucose has been reported to accompany general ferrous ion catalyzed nitrile formation (

), and as we detected amide formation under such conditions as well, a complex reaction involving various other sulfur compounds could be hypothesized. From the perspective of glucobarbarin biology, the results reported here show that formation of a suggested thioamide from glucobarbarin is not easily reproduced and was apparently not of importance at a range of biologically relevant conditions. The latter result had been predicted in a review article (

).
</p>
         <p>
As resedine is not accumulated in intact plants, further metabolism is anticipated 
in vivo
. The committed step would be turnover of the precursor glucosinolate in intact plants, and candidate genes for such turnover were identified in 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
. Tissue-specific biosynthesis and storage of glucosinolates is well described (

). Localization of a putative OATase could pinpoint sites of turnover. As an alternative to classical isolation and sequencing, we suggest that co-expression analysis (e.g. 

; 

; 

), using the identified genes as leads, could identify the OATase and other enzymes involved in glucosinolate turnover in intact plants.
</p>
         <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Barbarea
</tp:taxon-name>
seems to have lost aliphatic glucosinolates and gained diversification of phenethyl and indole glucosinolates and derived compounds (

). The increasingly wellcharacterized wild plant 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
(
Byrne et al., 2017
)
</tp:taxon-name>
is polymorphic for a range of defense related metabolites as well as pest- and disease resistances (

). This biochemically innovative plant species would seem to be a valuable genetic resource for a number of traits, including some pathways of glucosinolate turnover and phytoalexin biosynthesis as discussed here.

base peak (

After the intended autolysis time, the beaker was put on a hot-plate and 8 ml of preheated, boiling 20% aq. MeOH was added for boiling extraction for 1 min (moving beaker on and off to avoid vigorous boiling), followed by centrifugation (
4000 g

O. Resedine eluted at 22 min, a few min after a group of numerous other peaks, while 
2
eluted at 32 min. Resedine for NMR was obtained by freeze drying after partial evaporation under a gentle air stream. The proton NMR spectrum of resedine was recorded on an AVANCE III 600 spectrometer equipped with a 
TCI
cryoprobe. The sample was dissolved in CDCl 
3
and the temperature set at 298 K during data acquisition. The spectrum was referenced at 7.26 ppm for the residual protonated signal. PERCH spectral analysis started with the building of a 3D model of the resedine molecular structure by means of MMS, the modeling tool integrated in PERCH. The predicted chemical shift and coupling constant values inferred from the 3D model were iteratively refined so that the corresponding calculated spectrum matched at best the experimental one (

3.12. Synthetic conversion of oxazolidine-2-thiones into oxazolidin- 2-ones
</p>
         <p>
Conversion of OATs to OAOs by treatment with H 
2
O 
2
had been reported (

; Moreno-Ma nas ~ and 

). Synthesis of 
3
was conducted by incubation of 
2
(20 
M
M) in up to 8% aq. H 
2
O 
2
overnight. We observed complete conversion of 
2
into resedine (
3
) (CAS 7693-77-8) and a more polar product (around 1:1 judged from HPLC-DAD area at 
210 nm
). Moderate variation of the conditions, with [H 
2
O 
2
] ranging from 0.8 to 8% and reaction times ranging from 4 h to 18 h (N ¼ 5), had no significant effect on product profile (
Fig. 11
). The intended product was found identical to 
3
from 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>

by ion trap HPLC-MS/ MS. Using QqToF-MS we confirmed the molecular formula (found: 164.0704 [MþH] 
þ
, calculated for C 
9
H 
10
O 
2
N: 164.0706. From QqToF-MS we also confirmed that the major fragments were due to loss of H 
2
O and CO 
2
(Supplementary 
Fig. 7
). The more polar product was tentatively identified as 2-amino-1-phenylethanol, a previously suggested breakdown product of barbarin (

), by ion trap HPLC-MS/MS (Supplementary 
Fig. 7
) and HPLC-QqToF-MS (found: 138.0913 [MþH]

         <p>
Two other OATs were available, (
S
)-5-ethyl-5-methylOAT (
9
) and (
R
)-5-vinylOAT (( 
R
)-goitrin) (
11
). For use as references below, they were also converted into OAOs by incubation overnight with aq. 1% H 
2
O

. The identity of the authentic reactant 
9
was confirmed by ion trap HPLC-MS/MS,

(with major loss of H

</p>
         <p>
Likewise, the identity of the authentic reactant 
11
was confirmed by ion trap HPLC-MS/MS and high res. HPLC-MS/MS (found: 130.0318, calculated for C 
5
H 
8
NOS 
þ
: 130.0321). The major product 5-vinylOAO (

z
114 [MþH] 
þ
, 
m

136 [MþNa] 
þ
and high res HPLC-MS (found: 114.0546, calculated for C

2
þ

: 114.0550) (Supplementary 
Fig. 9
). For these latter OAO syntheses, the corresponding amino-alcohols were apparently not major side-products of the oxidative conversion from OAT to OAO by H 
2
O 
2
, but other polar side-products were detected.

3.13. Spiking with potential OATase substrates
</p>
         <p>
For each experiment, a number of 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
upper leaves (4‾8) were pooled and homogenized (in a mortar at room temperature) in order to minimize biological variation between individual assays. For testing of various OAO precursors, four 
0.10 g
aliquots of leaf homogenate were distributed in each of four 10 ml beakers, mixed with 0.10 ml of either water (control), aq. (
R
)-goitrin (
4 mg
/ml), aq. epiprogoitrin (
8 mg
/ml) or aq. (
S
)-5-ethyl-5-methylOAT (
4 mg
/ml). In a further four beakers, water and the same potential substrate solutions were mixed 1:1 with 50 mM aq. sodium acetate buffer pH 5 as a control, and also incubated in parallel. After gentle mixing with a pipette tip, each beaker was covered with a lid and incubated in parallel for 2 h. Then, beakers were put on a hot-plate, 2 ml boiling water was added, and hot extraction carried out for 1 min. This experiment was carried out in duplicate on two different days, except for the epiprogoitrin experiment that was not repeated.
</p>
         <p>
For testing heat sensitivity, half of the total leaf homogenate was heated for 4 min in a test tube immersed in a boiling water bath. From the heated part, four 
0.10 g
aliquots were distributed in each of four 10 ml beakers, mixed with either 0.10 ml aq. (
S
)-5-ethyl-5- methylOAT (
4 mg
/ml) (N ¼ 2) or 0.10 ml water (control) (N ¼ 2). From the remaining, non-heated part, four 
0.10 g
aliquots were also distributed in four beakers and added the same amounts of the OAT solution or water (N ¼ 
2 þ
2). In a further four beakers, the same OAT solution or water was mixed 1:1 with 50 mM aq. sodium acetate buffer as a control, and also incubated in parallel (N ¼ 
2 þ
2). After gentle mixing with a pipette tip, each beaker was covered with a lid and incubated in parallel for 2 h. Then, beakers were put on a hot-plate, 2 ml boiling water was added, and hot extraction carried out for 1 min.
</p>
         <p>
From both experiments, the entire material after boiling extraction was taken to 2.0 ml and mixed. A sample was centrifuged (
6000 g
, 4 min) and the supernatant taken to ion trap HPLC-MS analysis. Care was taken in all experiments to make sure that H 
2
O 
2
contamination could be completely ruled out as a factor. Analysis of enzyme assay products was carried out before analysis of OAO references containing surplus H 
2
O 
2
to make sure that contamination with H 
2
O 
2
could not happen in the HPLC autosampler either. Lack of OAO production from homogenate alone, observation of barbarin and resedine as endogenous metabolites (also in heated control due to reaction before heating), and positive OAO production from (
S
)-5-ethyl-5-methylOAT, goitrin, and progoitrin were all consistent.

). Due to different sequence length, the phylogenetic analysis was constructed based on position 170 to position 
563 in
the amino acid residue alignment (Supplementary Table 2). The phylogenetic tree (
Fig. 10
) was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model (

). The tree with the highest log likelihood (–3049.6303) is shown. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories) (þG, parameter ¼ 0.6003).
