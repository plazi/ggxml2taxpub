The 1 H NMR spectrum of 1 showed the signals\n            of two olefinic protons at δ H 6.77 (d, J = 6.9 Hz, H-7) and 5.28 (d, J = 5.9 Hz, H-11),\n            two oxygenated methines at δ H 3.24 (dd, J = 11.6, 4.2 Hz, H-3) and 3.91 (m, H-22), one\n            secondary methyl at δ H 0.96 (d, J = 6.6 Hz, H 3 -21), and seven tertiary methyls at δ H\n            0.69 (s, H 3 -18), 0.98 (s, H 3 -19), 1.23 (s, H 3 -26), 1.24 (s, H 3 -27), 1.01 (s, H 3\n            -28), 0.88 (s, H 3 -29), and 1.07 (s, H 3 -30). The 13 C NMR spectrum of 1 displayed 30\n            carbons, including a carbonyl carbon at δ C 217.4 (C-15), four olefinic carbons at δ C\n            124.3 (C-7), 135.1 (C-8), 146.3 (C-9), and 114.6 (C-11), five sp 3 -hybrid methines, two\n            of which at δ C 78.9 (C-3) and 80.4 (C-22) were oxygenated, seven methylenes, eight\n            methyls, and five sp 3 -hybrid quaternary carbons, including an oxygenated at δ C 80.1\n            (C-25). The above spectroscopic data were close to those of ganodercochlearin A ( ),\n            which possesses a tetrahydrofuran ring in the side chain. The major difference was\n            arisen from the carbonylation of C-15 instead of the hydroxylation of C-24. The chemical\n            shift of H-16 ( δ H 2.54, 2.06) and the HMBC correlations from H 3 -30 and H-17 to C-15\n            ( Fig. 2 ) revealed a carbonyl group was located at C-15. The up-field shift of C-23 (Δ\n            δ C 2.5 ppm), C-24 (Δ δ C 39.7 ppm), and C-25 (Δ δ C 1.6 ppm) in comparison with those\n            of ganodercochlearin A indicated the disappearance of a hydroxyl substituent on C-24.\n            Further detailed COSY and HMBC correlations analysis ( Fig. 2 ) established the planar\n            structure of 1 , 3-hydroxy-22,25- epoxylanosta-7,9 (11)-dien-15-one. The NOE\n            correlations of H-3/H 3 -28 and H-3/H-5 suggested that H-3 was α - oriented. Though H-22\n            exhibited obviously NOE interactions with H-16 α and H-16 β , the absolute configuration\n            of C-22 cannot be unambiguously concluded based solely on this information. However, by\n            using single crystal XRD analysis conducted with Cu Kα radiation ( Fig. 3 , CCDC,\n            2077919), the absolute configuration of C-22 was determined to be R . Thus, the\n            structure of 1 was elucidated as 3 β -hydroxy-22 R ,25-epoxylansta-7,9 (11)-dien-15-one,\n            with a trivial name of phellinol A. ",

Its NMR data ( Table 1 ) were similar to those of 1 ,\n            suggesting a lanostane triterpenoid with a tetrahydrofuran ring. The major differences\n            were that the 1 H NMR spectrum of 2 displayed the signals of two additional oxygenated\n            methines at δ H 4.13 (q, J = 3.6 Hz, H-2) and 4.25 (dd, J = 9.8, 5.6 Hz, H-15), instead\n            of two olefinic protons in 1 . The 1 H– 1 H COSY correlations from H-1 to H-3, and from\n            H-15 to H-24, as well as the HMBC correlations of H 2 -1/C-2, H 2 -1/C-3, H-2/C-3,\n            H-2/C-10, and H 3 -30/C-15 revealed the hydroxylations of C-2 and C-15. The position of\n            a fully substituted double bond (Δ 8,9 ) was suggested by the HMBC correlations of H 2\n            -7/C-8, H 2 -7/C-9, H 2 -11/C-8, H 3 -19/C-9, and H 3 -30/C-8. The small coupling\n            constant (3.6 Hz) between H-2 and H-3 confirmed that they were cis -oriented ( ). The\n            NOE correlations of H-2/H-3, H-2/H-5, H-3/H-5, and H-3/H 3 -28 revealed the α\n            -orientations of H-2 and H-3. The obvious NOE correlation between H-15 and H 3 -18\n            indicated that H-15 was β -oriented ( Fig. 4 ). The spectroscopic data of the C-20–C-27\n            sidechain were in good agreement of those of 1 , which suggested that C-22 should be in\n            R form. To provide more justification for this configuration, the acetylated product of\n            2 ( 2a ), initially obtained by treating 2 with acetic anhydride, was further treated\n            with BBr 3 to yield tetrahydrofuran ring-opening product 2b . The coupling constant of\n            H-22 (dd, J = 9.6, 3.1 Hz) and the proton chemical shifts from H-21 to H- 27 in 2b were\n            similar to those of inonotsuoxodiol A ( ) with the same side chain, supporting a R\n            configuration at C-22. Based on the above evidence, the structure of 2 was assigned as\n            22 R ,25-epoxylansta-8-en-2 β ,3 β ,15 α -triol and named phellinol B. ",

The molecule weight of 3 was two mass units less than that of 2 , corresponding\n            to a degree of unsaturation. Comparison of their spectroscopic data revealed that the\n            isolated double bond (Δ 8 ) in 2 was replaced by a conjugated one (Δ 7,8 and Δ 9,11 ) in\n            3 , as suggested by the chemical shifts of H-7 at δ H 5.86, d ( J = 6.6 Hz) and H-11 at\n            δ H 5.33, d ( J = 4.5 Hz). The position of the conjugated double bond Δ 7,8 and Δ 9,11\n            was further revealed by 1 H– 1 H COSY and HMBC correlations. The α -orientations of H-2\n            and H-3, and the β -orientation of H-15 were confirmed by the pertinent NOE\n            correlations. The identical spectroscopic data of the side chain between 2 and 3\n            suggested that C-22 had an ( R )-configuration.

The HMBC correlations from H 2 -6 ( δ H 2.80, 2.56) to C-4 ( δ C\n            38.1), C-7 ( δ C 204.5), C-8 ( δ C 139.7), and C-10 ( δ C 40.5), and from H-11 to C-8\n            and C-13 ( δ C 48.8) revealed the locations of additional carbonyl and hydroxyl groups\n            at C-7 and C-11, respectively. The NOE correlation of H-11/H 3 -19 suggested a β\n            -orientation of H-11 ( Fig. 4 ).

The H9c2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’ s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco)\n            supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin\n            (Gibco) at 37 ◦ C, 5% CO 2 . The H9c2 cells were subsequently subjected to\n            oxygen-glucose deprivation condition for 6 h, in which cells were put into a chamber\n            saturated with 95% N 2 and 5% CO 2 after medium was washed by PBS and replaced with DMEM\n            without glucose and FBS. The cells were then treated with indicated drugs during the\n            period of reperfusion for another 6 h. Diazoxide was used as positive control. The cell\n            viability was measured by MTT assay ( ). ",
