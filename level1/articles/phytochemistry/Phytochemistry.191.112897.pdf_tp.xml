Frankincense of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
has long been used in traditional medicines, mainly for its interesting anti-inflammatory and anti-depressant properties of its di- and triterpenes. Boswellic acids (triterpenes) and cembranoids (diterpenes) are the major constituents of frankincense from all reported species which are responsible for the overall biological activity of frankincense. Boswellic acids have been thoroughly investigated for decades but cembranoids have attracted considerable attention only recently, and a good number of publications have highlighted the important role of these 14-membered rings in contributing to the superior anti-inflammatory activity of the sacred resin. Partial and total syntheses of some cembranoids from frankincense have been reported. Their therapeutic potential is not limited to the well proven anti-inflammatory activity but also to their recently reported anti-depressant properties.

         <p>
There is a considerable number of publications in the field of cembranoids of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
where we feel a review in this topic will be of interest to the readership of 
Phytochemistry
. In this article we have discussed the chemistry (isolation and chemical structures as well as synthetic studies), biogenesis and bioactivity of the reported cembranoids of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
species.
</tp:taxon-name>
The structural discrepancies due to wrongly assigned structures of some cembranoids have been highlighted and corrected. We have covered the related literature up to the end of 2020.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Frankincense - a resin of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
</tp:taxon-name>
trees is the most precious resin religiously, socially, economically and medicinally. In an attempt to reviving its historical role in treating various chronic diseases, our group has been intensively involved in unravelling the secrets of this ancient resin. Boswellic acids and cembranoids are the major chemical constituents of frankincense with well documented medicinal properties. However, compared to boswellic acids which have been thoroughly reviewed, cembranoids have received less attention (Ahmed Al-Harrasi, Hidayat Hussain, 
Rene Csuk
, 2018; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Cembranoids are naturally occurring 14-membered ring diterpenoids having interesting structural features and important biological properties. They are generated by cyclization of a geranylgeraneol derived precursor involving C-1 and C-14. The representative compound, cembrene (
1
) (
Fig. 1
) was isolated from pine oleoresin, and subsequently a large number of related compounds (cembranoids) have been reported from various terrestrial and marine organisms. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
are one of the valuable sources of these compounds (Ahmed Al-Harrasi, Hidayat Hussain, Rene Csuk, 2018; 

;
</p>
         <p>

).
</p>
         <p>
A large number of cembranoids have been reported from the various 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
species.
</tp:taxon-name>
Their structural complexities and important medicinal properties have attracted the attention of both chemists and biologists. They are now actively engaged in isolation, synthesis and exploration of new pharmacological activities of this group of compounds (Ahmed Al-Harrasi, Hidayat Hussain, Rene Csuk, 2018).
</p>
         <p>
There is no comprehensive review on the cembranoids of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
species.
</tp:taxon-name>
In this regard, with our research in the field, we would like to review the subject in detail. In this review we will discuss the chemistry, biogenesis and bioactivity of the reported cembranoids of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
species.
</tp:taxon-name>
Furthermore, we will discuss the structural discrepancies of various cembranoids reported in literature. In our discussion we will cover the literature up to the end of 2020.

         <p>
The chemistry of cembranoids of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
has been an important topic of investigation in recent years. The isolation and identification of a good number of cembranoids from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
</tp:taxon-name>
         </p>
         <p>prompted synthetic modifications of these interesting compounds. Partial and total syntheses of some of the isolates have also been performed.</p>

2.1. Chemotaxonomy
</title>
         <p>
There are 24 described species in the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
</tp:taxon-name>
distributed between 
South Arabia
, Africa and 
India
. The following table (
Table 1
) summarizes all species with their synonyms and geographical locations.
</p>
         <p>
The controversy in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
</tp:taxon-name>
taxonomy is huge despite the fact that only 24 species exist in this genus. This is partly due to the large chemical analyses that were based on commercial samples that lack information about the taxonomic origin (Ahmed 

; 

) but also due to the huge overlap of chemical constituents in the studied species.
</p>
         <p>
The synonymy of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia sacra
</tp:taxon-name>
growing in 
South Arabia
(
Oman
and Yamen) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia carterii
</tp:taxon-name>
growing in Africa was misleading. Some literature reports considered the two species to be the same, while others regarded them as different. This is still confusing and unless genomic studies supported by chemical analysis of the oil and resins are done, it will be difficult to prove or disprove their synonymy. Another controversy comes from the confusion between 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia papyrifera
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia carterii
</tp:taxon-name>
but this was corrected in all publications after 2012.

         <p>
The structures of the cembranoids were settled by a detailed investigation of their conformational analysis data and spectral properties, mainly their 1D and 2D NMR and high-resolution mass spectral data (
Table 3
). Some routine chemical transformations of certain cembranoids, such as serratol, were carried out to characterize the molecules (RS Pardhy, SC Bhattacharyya, 1978; 

). The X-ray crystallographic analysis has also been utilized to confirm the structures of several complex cembranoids. Some conformational studies of several cembranoids have also been reported (

). It is noteworthy mentioning that we were unable to find a supporting evidence that any of the reported compounds is an artefact. Having said that, it is not unexpected to see artifacts given the common intramolecular opening of epoxyalcohols and the expected Payne rearrangement of α- hydroxyepoxides, however, we relied solely on the published data. A careful chromatographic isolation of these compounds should be performed to prove or disprove this fact.

2.3. Conformational aspects
</title>
         <p>In general, Cembranoids are macrocyclic diterpenes comprising four isoprene units bonded head-to-tail, possessing 14-membered ring with three symmetrically distributed methyl groups and one isopropyl group. The cembrane nucleus has a symmetry plane with an axis passing through C-1 and C-8 (Weinheimer, C. W. J. ChangI. FlamentJ. A. MatsonT. NishidaG. OhloffF. W. WehrliA. J, 1979).</p>
         <p>
Some of the reported cembranes are detected by GCMS and therefore no structural elucidation is possible and hence no conformational studies exist. The stereochemistry of the chiral centers of compounds 
6–9
was established based on NOE (

). The structure of rel (1 
S
, 3 
R
, 7 
E
, 11 
S
, 12 
R
)-1,12-epoxy-4-methylcembr-7-ene-3,11-diol (
23
) was confirmed by the HSQC and HMBC spectra. The relative stereochemistry was found to be in full agreement with that of incensole oxide (
8
) by the observed NOEs in a 2D NOESY spectrum (H2a + b/H18a, H-5a/H-18 b, H-6a/Me-19, H-7/H-9a, H-7/H-10a, H-10 b/Me-20, H-11/H-14a, H-11/Me-19). The absolute configuration of compound 
8
is assumed as depicted in its structure because of the direct comparison with incensole oxide (
8
) that is evidenced by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Ren et al., 2015).
</p>
         <p>
Due to the fact that the absolute stereochemistry of C–1S has been unambiguously confirmed by X-ray analysis for the similar compound incensole oxide (
8
) (

) as well as by CD spectroscopy of Serratol (
14
) (

), the enantiomeric assignment for isoincensole oxide (
12)
(
Fig. 3
) as rel (1 
S
, 7 
R
, 8 
S
, 11 
S
, 12 
R
) should be preferred (

). This fact is supported by NOESY spectra that revealed cis arrangement of the isopropyl group with Me-20. This is, however, in contrast with Kato’ s proposal (

) who suggested the 
E
configuration. The NOE between H-15 and Me-20 confirms the cis arrangement of the isopropyl group and Me-20 (1S, 12R). Kato et al. proposed the configuration of C-11 as 
S
due to the lack of NOE interactions between H-11 and Me-20. However, based on the molecular models proposed by Greve el al. (

), this NOE should theoretically exist and it was interestingly seen in the NOESY experiment. It is therefore concluded that the stereochemistry at C-11 is confirmed as 
S
. The lack of NOE interactions between H-7 and Me-19 indicates that these two groups are in 
trans
position to each other. Furthermore, 

concluded that the stereochemistry of 7 
R
, 8 
S
attributed to a downfield shift of the olefinic proton when compared with the 7 
S
, 8 
S
epimer but they haven’ t compared it with the other diastereomer 7 
S
, 8 
R
. Greve et al. detected clear NOEs between H-3 and H-6a as well as between H-7 and H-13a in their NOESY experiment which further support the rel (1S,7S,8R,11S, 12R) configuration. Therefore, the stereochemistry of isoincensole oxide (
12)
is as proposed by 

, and adopted here.

         <p>
We have reported (

) the full structural assignment and absolute configuration of incensfuran (
21)
by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and electronic and vibrational circular dichroism spectroscopy (ECD, VCD). The relative stereochemistry at C-1, C-12, C-11, and C-8 was confirmed by the NOESY correlations of H-5 with Me-19 and Me-20, and of Me-17/16 with Me-20.
</p>
         <p>
The stereochemistry of Boscartins A-H (
30–37
) was confirmed by NOESY experiments (Ren et al., 2015). The NOE correlations of compound 
30
(
Fig. 4
) has confirmed its relative configuration. The existence of NOE correlations of H-3/H-10a, H-11/H-10a, and H-10 b/Me-20 and the absence of NOE correlations of H-11/H-10 b and H-11/Me-20, suggested that OH-3 was in an α- position, OH-11 was in an exo and α- position, and Me-20 was in a β- position.
</p>
         <p>
The NOE correlations of H-3/H-6b, H-7/H-6a, and H-7/Me-18 proved that both Me-18 and H-7 were in α- orientations. The NOE correlation of H-9 with Me-19 suggested that the olefinic geometry is 8 
Z
. Furthermore, the NOE correlation of H-3 with H-15 proved the β- orientation of the isopropyl group. Finally, the absolute configuration (1

R

Z
, 11

,12 
R
) was revealed by X-ray crystal structure. Details of NOESY experiments of the other Boscartins can be found in the original reference (Ren et al., 2015).
</p>
         <p>
The configurations and structure of another group of Cembrane-type diterpenoids (Boscartins AH-AK 
63–66
) were established by analysis of NOESY experiments (

). The NOE correlations of H-3/H-5b, H-7; H-6/H-7, Me-18, Me-19; H-7/H-3, H-5b; H-10a/Me-20, H-3, H-7, H-11; H-10 b/H-9; and H-11/H-3, H-10a, Me- 
20 in
cembrane 
63
showed that H-3, H-6, H-7, H-10a, H-11, Me-18 and Me-20 were all in beta orientation, thus, the 3,4-oxirane, 6,7-oxirane and the acetyl group at C-11 are in alpha orientations. This confirmed the structure of this compound to be (1

Finally, 

(

) described ten cembrane-type diterpenoids from the gum resin of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia sacra
</tp:taxon-name>
. The relative configuration of compound 
67A
was established by means of the ROESY experiment which revealed a different relative configuration when compared with incensole oxide (
8
). The major key correlations from H-7 to H-5a, H-9a and Me-19 to H-6a, and H-9b; from H-15 to Me-16, Me-17, and Me-20; from Me 18 to Me-17, H-5b, and H-6a; from H-11 to H-13a, H-14a, H-3, and H-10; and the absence of correlations from H-11 to Me- 
20 in
the ROESY spectrum confirmed that the double bond was 
trans
. Furthermore, the isopropyl groups, Me-18 and Me-20, were found to be in β- orientations while H-3 and H-11 were in α- orientations. These important correlations suggested opposite configurations of H-3 and Me-18 between 
67
and incensole oxide (
8
) where H-3 was β- oriented and Me-18 was α- oriented. The absolute configuration of 
67
was unequivocally confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis to be 1

The cembranoids of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
were found to possess fascinating structural patterns (
Fig. 1
). Generally, they contain nuclear unsaturation with double bonds (
E
or 
Z
) inside the 14-membered core along with various functional groups including hydroxyl, ether, ester and epoxide.
</p>
         <p>
The structural discrepancies of a number of cembranoids (
Table 2
, 
Fig. 2
) isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
have been observed. In some cases, this is due to the settlement of the structures based on the previous structures of the related compounds which were presented later in modified structural versions. For an example, a correlation was shown between the structure of cembrenol (
5
) and the earlier reported structure of incensole (
6A
) (
Fig. 5
). (

). More recently, Hasegawa et al. mentioned that diterpenoids such as incensole (
6
) may be important odor components (

).
</p>
         <p>
Frankincense (olibanum) is one of the oldest aromatic materials used by humans, and the key molecular constituents contributing to its characteristic odor are known now. The characteristic odor of frankincense is due to the presence of (1 
S
, 2 
S
)- (+)- 
trans
- and (1 
S
, 2 
R
)- (+)- 
cis
- 2-octylcyclopropyl-1-carboxylic acids which are highly potent and substantive odorants occurring a very small amounts (ppm) in all of the frankincense samples analyzed, even those showing radically different volatile compositions. These cyclopropyl-derived acids provide the very characteristic old churchlike endnote of the frankincense odor (

).
</p>
         <p>
The structures of some boscartin-type cembranoids (such as boscartin-M (
42
) and related compounds) have been correlated with those of incensole (
6
) and incensole acetate (
7
). The last two compounds have been suggested to act as the biogenetic precursors of these boscartins (discussed in Biogenesis). However, the wrong structures of incensole (
6
) and incensole acetate (
7
) have resulted from the wrong configuration of 5-β- OH (
Fig. 6
) (J. Wang et al., 2019).
</p>
         <p>
It is interesting to mention that several cembranoids (such as boscartins AL-AO (
67–70
, 
67A–70A
) were also reported with the same names but with different structures (
Table 2
, 
Fig. 2
) (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
The structures of the cembranoids were settled by a detailed investigation of their spectral properties, mainly their 
1
H NMR, 
13
C NMR and 2D data. Here, we provided spectral data of some representative cembranoids of compounds

2.4. Synthetic studies
</title>
         <p>
Various chemical modifications and syntheses of cembranoids of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
have been carried out. These synthetic studies were accomplished mainly involving incensole and incensole acetate along with some other cembranoids. The results have been discussed in some earlier reports (Ahmed 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Recently 5- 
epi
-incensole (
77
) has been prepared from incensole acetate (
7
) (Avula et al., 2016). The latter was deacetylated to incensole (
6
) which subsequently underwent Jones oxidation followed by a reduction with NaBH 
4
(Scheme 1).
</p>
         <p>
An interesting protecting-group free enantioselective total synthesis of boscartin F (
35
) has recently been reported (

). The compound exhibits X-box bonding protein transcriptional activity. The synthesis was initiated (Scheme 2) from known allyl alcohol (
78
) which - upon Sharpless epoxidation using L-DET and subsequent treatment with vinyl-Grignard reagent-afforded diol 
79
. The mesylation/cyclization of 
79
yielded an epoxide which was opened with a Grignard reagent, methallyl magnesium bromide, to furnish a tertiary alcohol 
80
. The iodoetherification of alcohol 
80
afforded the tetrahydrofuran 
81
. The latter - when treated with KO 
2
/18-crown-6 followed by a subsequent oxidation with IBX - generated aldehyde 
82
. The other olefinic part 
84
was prepared from the ester 
83
by DIBAL-H reduction and HWE-olefination. The aldol reaction of 
84
with 
82
produced the adduct 
85
. The structure and absolute configuration of 
85
was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis of its semicarbazone. Finally, a ring-closing metathesis (RCM) of 
85
using Stewart-Grubb catalyst followed by epoxidation with 
m
-CPBA provided natural boscartin F. The synthesis was completed in 10 steps with 3 % overall yield.

3. Biogenesis
</title>
         <p>
Biosynthesis of cembranoids has been discussed by various researchers (Ahmed 

; 

; McMillan. J, 1999). Four steps are involved in the biogenesis of cembranoids. The first step is the formation of the isoprene unit through two different pathways, starting from 1-deoxyxylulose or mevalonic acid. The combination of the isoprene units results in the generation of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) (isoprenoid) in the second step. Later, in the third step, cyclization of GGPP occurs via a carbenium ion to 
<tp:taxon-name>form the</tp:taxon-name>
cembranoid core structure. Finally, in the fourth step functionalization (e.g. oxidation; hydroxylation etc.) of the skeleton of cembranoids takes place to 
<tp:taxon-name>form the</tp:taxon-name>
various naturally occurring cembranoids (Scheme 3).
</p>
         <p>
Incensole (
6
) and incensole acetate (
7
) have been considered as the biogenetic precursors of various boscartin-type cembranoids (Schemes 4 and 5) (

; J. Wang et al., 2019). These compounds underwent oxidation, isomerization and esterification to produce new boscartins derivatives. However, some biogenetic pathways have been reported with wrongly presented stereostructure of these compounds (Scheme 3) (

).
</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>
In the above scheme C-5 of incensole acetate (
7
) was presented with β- OAc but this compound contains α- OAc at C-5. Consequently, there should be a revision of the structure of boscartin M (
42
) and related compounds.

</p>
         <p>
Incensole (
6
) and incensole acetate (
7
) (
Fig. 7
) were evaluated as novel potential NF-κB inhibitors. Incensole acetate did not interfere with NNF-α induced activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and P38 nitrogen-activated protein kinase. The compound was found to inhibit the cytokine and bipopolysaccharide-mediated NF-KB activation. It inhibited the activation of loop phosphorylation of TAK-TAB mediated IKB kinase (IKK) but showed no effect on IKK activity 
in vitro
and no suppression of IKB phosphorylation in co-stimulated T-cells (

, 

, 2008b). An 
in silico
approach suggested that incensole (
6
) and incensole acetate (
7
) are excellent anti-psoriatic agents (

).

Among several derivatives of incensole, the monoacetate and phenyl acetate esters showed a potent inhibitory activity on NF-κB activation but was not seen for serratol (
14
) (

).
</p>
         <p>
In the brain of post-CHI (closed head injury) mice, incensole acetate (
7
) reduced glial activation and inhibited the expression of interleukin- 
IB
and TNFα m-RNAs, including cell death in macrophages at traumatized region. Incensole (
6
) (but not incensole acetate (
7
)) was found to be potent on 1L-6 induced STAT 3 activation because of the involvement of this activation in neuro-inflammation (

4.2. Anti-depression activity

         <p>
The psychoactive activity of various cembranoids was realized by activating TRPV3 (Transient receptor potential vanilloid 3) channels in the brain of wild-type mice. TRPV3 mRNA is observed in neurons all over the brain (

; 

; 

). Incensole acetate (
7
) was found to be a potent TRPV3 against resulting in anti-depression like behavioural effects with associated changes in C-Fos activation in the brain. The compound induced calcium influence in TRPV3 channels. A significant decrease of corticosterone levels in mice also supported the anti-depression effect of incensole acetate.
</p>
         <p>
Incensole (
6
) and incensone showed moderate potency to stimulate the TRPV3 mediated calcium inflow (

, 2012; 

). Several other synthetic analogues of incensole also showed moderate potency. Serratol (
14

Incensole (

) and incensone (
6A

These compounds induced elevated brain GABA levels, suggesting the involvement of a GABAergic mechanism. The molecular docking studies to elucidate the mode of action for the anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects of the compounds were also performed (

X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) transcriptional activity assay was selected, and the duel luciferase reported detection method was applied. 9-Oxodihydrocoptisin was used as the positive control. At 10 μM concentration, boscartins A (
30
), F (
35
), G (
36
), H (
37
) significantly activated XBP1 transcription. This study indicated that the gum resin of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia carterii
</tp:taxon-name>
can be utilized to treat ulcers.

4.6. Hepatoprotective activity
</title>
         <p>
The hepatoprotective activity of different cembranoids of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
were evaluated at 10 μM against paracetamol induced Hep G 
2
cell damage (

; 

; J. Wang et al., 2019). Bicyclol was used as the positive control. Incensole acetate (
7
) showed impressive hepatoprotective activity while incensole oxide (
8
), incensole oxide acetate (
9
), isoincensole oxide (
12
) and boscartin M (
42
) held only moderate activities. Boscartin A-H (
30–37
) was more potent than the positive control. Boscartins AC (
30–32
), AG (
62
), AN (
69
) and AP (
45
) also showed impressive activity.
</p>
         <p>
Boscartins P (
45
) to Z (
55
) and AA to AG (
56–62
) were evaluated for hepatoprotective activity against D-galactosamine induced toxicity in HL-7702 cells using bicyclol as positive control. Most of the compounds were found to be active (

; 

; J. Wang et al., 2019).

4.7. Anti-cancer activity
</title>
         <p>
The cytotoxicity of various cembranoids was examined (Ren et al., 2015; 

; 

). Serratol (
14
) showed cytotoxic activity against the L6 rat skeletal myoblast cell lines. Boscartins A-H (
30–37
) was evaluated against IEC-6 cells, but they did not show any activity. Boscartins P-AG (
45–62
) were also tested against several human cancer cell lines including Bel 7402 (human hematoma cell line) and A 2780 (human ovarian cancer cell line). However, these compounds did not show any obvious cytotoxicity against all these cell lines.
</p>
         <p>
Boscartins AH (
63
) - AD (
59
), Q (
46
) and Z (
55
) were evaluated for antiproliferative activity against HCT-116 human colon cancer cell using cisplatin as positive control. All the compounds showed weak antiproliferative activity. However, boscartins I–K (
38–40
) -when tested against human breast cancer cell MCF-7 - did not show any considerable activity (Ren et al., 2015; 

; 

).

5. Conclusion
</title>
         <p>
In the present article we have reviewed the reported chemistry, biogenesis and bioactivity of cembranoids 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
species.
</tp:taxon-name>
The structural discrepancies of some of the compounds have been discussed. The biogenesis of different cembranoids has been illustrated. The isolated cembranoids of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Boswellia
species
</tp:taxon-name>
are associated with various bioactivities.
