1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>
Scabiosa stellata
</tp:taxon-name>
L., known as starflower pincushions, belongs to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Caprifoliaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family. It is an endemic North African herbaceous, bristly-hairy annual plant (

). In folk medicine, leaves and flowers of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Scabiosa stellata
</tp:taxon-name>
were used in 
Morocco
to treat heel cracks (

). The majority of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Scabiosa
</tp:taxon-name>
, comprising about 100 species, occurs in the Mediterranean region (

) and among them, approximately 12 species can be found in 
Algeria
(

). Up to date, chemical investigations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Scabiosa
species
</tp:taxon-name>
have mainly revealed the presence of saponins (

; 

; 

), flavonoids, coumarins (

), and iridoid glucosides (

; 

). The aglycones of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Scabiosa
</tp:taxon-name>
saponins were identified as oleanolic acid, hederagenin, and ursolic acid with glucose, rhamnose, xylose, and arabinose as sugar (

,b, 

; 

), or pomolic acid with glycoside containing an allose in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Scabiosa rotata
</tp:taxon-name>
saponins (

, 

). Previous chemical studies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. stellata
</tp:taxon-name>
demonstrated the presence of fatty acids, 
b
-sitosterol, stigmasterol, oleanolic, ursolic acids, bis-iridoids and flavonoids (

; 

). In a continuing of our search for bioactive constituents from Algerian flora, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Scabiosa stellata
</tp:taxon-name>
L. was phytochemically investigated, and eight undescribed triterpenoid saponins, namely, scabiostellatosides A-H (
1—8
), together with three known compounds (
9—11
) were isolated (
Fig.1
). Herein, we report the isolation and structural elucidation of the undescribed triterpenoid saponins, along with the evaluation of their cytotoxic activity against human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cell line.

2. Results and discussion
</title>
         <p>
The 70% EtOH extract from the whole plant of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. stellata
</tp:taxon-name>
was subjected to Diaion HP-20 resin chromatography to give the saponin-containing fractions, which were subjected to further column chromatography to yield eight undescribed triterpenoid saponins (
1—8
) and three known compounds (
9—11
) (
Fig. 1
). Their structures were established by spectroscopic data analyses (1D, 2D-NMR and HRESIMS) and by comparison with literature data. Acid hydrolysis of an aliquot of the saponin-containing fraction allowed the identification of five monosaccharides as D- glucose, D- xylose, D- glucuronic acid, L- arabinose and L- rhamnose by comparison with authentic samples (see Experimental Section).

Scabiostellatoside A (
1
) was obtained as amorphous white powder. Its molecular formula, C 
64
H 
104
O 
29
, was determined by the positive-ion HRESIMS at 
m/z
1359.6552 [M þ Na] 
þ
(calcd for 1359.6561). The 
1
H NMR spectrum displayed characteristic resonances of an olean-12-ene skeleton, namely, seven tertiary methyls at 
d
H
0.83, 0.88, 0.93, 0.97, 0.99, 1.05 and 1.18, an oxymethine at 
d
H
3.15 (dd, 
J
¼ 11.6, 4.2 Hz), and an olefinic proton resonance at 
d
H
5.27 (t, 
J
¼ 3.4 Hz). The 
13
C NMR spectrum showed resonances for one carboxyl group (
d
C
176.7), two olefinic carbons (
d
C
122.4, 143.5), one downfield glycosylation shifted oxygenated methine (
d
C
89.2), and seven methyls. Taken together, these data were indicative of a typical oleanolic acid (

). This assumption was confirmed by analysis of the COSY, TOCSY, ROESY, HSQC and HMBC spectra which allowed the full assignment of the proton and carbon resonances of the aglycone (
Table 1
). In the ROESY spectrum, correlations observed between H-3/H-5 and H-5/H-9 indicated their 
a
-axial orientation and thus the 
b
-orientation of the oxygen at C-3. The sugar part of 
1
consists of six residues as evidenced by 
1
H NMR spectrum which displayed six anomeric protons at 
d
H
4.36, 4.49, 4.51, 5.19, 5.20 and 5.37, showing correlations in the HSQC spectrum to carbons at 
d
C
103.3,105.1,103.9,101.1, 100.1 and 94.4, respectively (
Table 2
). Two 
a
-L- rhamnopyranose units (rha and rha') were identified by equatorial anomeric protons [
d
H
5.20 (d, 
J
¼ 1.5 Hz, rha); 5.19 (d, 
J
¼ 1.4 Hz, rha')], the small coupling constant between 
Heq-2
and 
Hax-3
(
J
¼ 3.5 Hz), the large coupling constants between 
Hax-
3 and 
Hax-4
(
J&gt;
9.5 Hz), and the coupling constant values of 6.2 Hz of methyl doublets [
d
H
1.24 (rha); 1.27 (rha')] (
Table 2
) (

). The NMR signals belonging to two 
b
-D- glucopyranose units were assigned starting from the anomeric proton at 
d
H
5.37 (d, 
J
¼ 8.1 Hz, glc') and 4.36 (d, 
J
¼ 7.8 Hz, glc). The H-1, H-2, H-3 and H-4 of glc and glc' exhibited large vicinal couplings (±7.8 Hz) indicating that all protons are axial (
Table 2
). The fifth sugar unit was identified as 
a
-L- arabinopyranose [
d
H-1
4.51 (d, 
J
¼ 5.3 Hz, ara)] based on the large 
J
H-1,H-2
and 
J
H-2,H-3
(7.1 Hz) and the small couplings 
J
H-3,H-4
(3.4 Hz) indicating that the H-4 was equatorial (
Table 2
) (

; 

). The last monosaccharide unit was identified as a 
b
-D- xylopyranose moiety [
d
H-1
4.49 (d, 
J
¼ 7.6 Hz, xyl)] by interpretation of 2D-NMR spectra. The H-1, H-2, H-3 and H-4 of xyl exhibited large vicinal couplings (±7.6 Hz) indicating that all are axials (
Table 2
). The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra of 
1
displayed many similarities with those of scabiosaponin A (3- 
O
-[
b
- D- glucopyranosyl-(1 
+
4)- 
b
-D- xylopyranosyl-(1 
+
3)- 
a

-L- arabinopyranonosyl]-28- 
O
-[
b
-D- glucopyranosyl-(1 
+

b
-D- glucopyranosyl]-oleanolic acid) (

), the difference was the nature and the position of attachment of last sugar residue linked to the xylose, 
a
-L- rhamnopyranose in 
1
instead of 
b
-D- glucopyranose in scabiosaponin A. The crosspeak observed in the HMBC spectrum between glc'-H-1/glc-C-6 (
d
C
68.1) and glc-H-1/aglycone-C-28 (
d
C
176.7) established the disaccharide [glc'-(1 
+
6)-glc] to be linked to the C-28 of the aglycone. In a similar fashion, the HMBC correlation between rha'-H-1/ xyl-C-3 (
d
C
82.1), xyl-H-1/rha-C-3 (
d
C
80.6), rha-H-1/ara-C-2 (
d
C
75.0) and ara-H-1/aglycone-C-3 (
d
C
89.2) indicated that the tetrasaccharide [rha'-(1 
+
3)-xyl-(1 
+
3)-rha-(1 
+
2)-ara] was attached to the C-3 of the aglycone (
Fig. 2
). In addition, ROESY correlations confirming the interglycosidic linkage and the point of attachment of the tetra-saccharide at the C-3 of the aglycone were observed between glc'-H-1/glc-H 
2
-6, rha'-H-1/xyl-H-3, xyl-H-1/ rha-H-3, rha-H-1/ara-H-2 and ara-H-1/aglycone-H-3. Based on all the foregoing evidence, scabiostellatoside A (
1
) was elucidated as 3- 
O
-[
a
-L- rhamnopyranosyl-(1 
+
3)- 
b
-D- xylopyranosyl-(1 
+
3)- 
a
-L- rhamnopyranosyl-(1 
+
2)- 
a
-L- arabinopyranonosyl]-28- 
O
-[
b
-D- glucopyranosyl-(1

-D- glucopyranosyl]-oleanolic acid.

Scabiostellatoside B (
2
) had a molecular formula of C 
64
H 
104
O 
29
, on the basis of its HRESIMS (
m/z
1359.6548 [M þ Na] 
þ
, calcd for 1359.6561). Comparing the NMR data of 
2
with those of 
1
(
Tables 1
and 
3
) showed that it had the same aglycone as 
1
, but differed in its saccharide units. The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR values of 
2
were almost superimposable on those of 
1
(
Tables 2
and 
4
) excepting those of 2- monosubstituted 
a
-L- arabinopyranose in 
1
. Instead, a second 
b
- xylopyranose unit (xyl) was identified starting from its anomeric proton at 
d
H
4.39 (d, 
J
¼ 7.1 Hz), characterized by the large coupling constants 
J
H-1,H-2
, 
J
H-2,H-3
and 
J
H-3,H-4
(±7.1 Hz) as summarized in 
Table 4
(

). The long-range correlations observed in the HMBC spectrum between glc'-H-1 (
d
H
4.36)/glc-C-6 (
d
C
68.1), glc-H-1 (
d
H
5.37)/aglycone-C-28 (
d
C
176.7), rha'-H-1 (
d
H
5.20)/xyl'- C-3 (
d
C
82.1), xyl'-H-1 (
d
H
4.48)/rha-C-3 (
d
C
80.8), rha-H-1 (
d
H
5.39)/ xyl-C-2 (
d
C
76.8) and xyl-H-1 (
d
H
4.39)/aglycone-C-3 (
d
C
88.9) indicated that the tetrasaccharide [rha'-(1 
+
3)-xyl 
0
-(1 
+
3)-rha- (1 
+
2)-xyl] was linked to the C-3 of the aglycone whereas the disaccharide [glc'-(1 
+
6)-glc] was linked to C-28 of the aglycone. In addition, as in 
1
, complementary pairs of ROESY correlations were found between anomeric and carbinol protons on opposite sides of the interglycosidic linkage and H-3 of the aglycone. The structure of scabiostellatoside B (
2
) was therefore identified as 3- 
O
- [
a
-L- rhamnopyranosyl-(1 
+
3)- 
b
-D- xylopyranosyl-(1 
+
3)- 
a
-L- rhamnopyranosyl-(1 
+
2)- 
b
-D- xylopyranosyl]-28 
-O
-[
b
-D- glucopyranosyl-(1 
+
6)- 
b
-D- glucopyranosyl]-oleanolic acid.

Scabiostellatoside C (
3
) gave the molecular formula of C 
70
H 
114
O 
34
, on the basis of the positive-ion HRESIMS (
m/z
1521.7097 [MþNa] 
þ
, calcd for 1521.7089). Comparing the NMR data of 
3
with those of 
1
(
Table 1
) showed that it had the same aglycone as 
1
, but differed in its saccharide units. The NMR spectroscopic data of 
3
were almost identical with those of 
1
except for one hexose unit (
Table 2
). Extensive 2D-NMR analysis (COSY, ROESY, HSQC, HMBC, TOCSY and HSQC-TOCSY) enabled the full assignments, as in 
1
, of the resonances of two 
b
-D- glucopyranosyl units [
d
H-1
5.37 (d, 
J
¼ 8.2 Hz, glc); 4.36 (d, 
J
¼ 7.8 Hz, glc')], two 
a
-L- rhamnopyranosyl units [
d
H-1
5.21 (brs, rha); 5.19 (brs, rha')], an 
a
-L- arabinopyranonosyl [
d
H-1
4.51 (d, 
J
¼ 5.3 Hz, ara)], and a 
b
-D- xylopyranosyl [
d
H-1
4.49 (d, 
J
¼ 7.6 Hz, xyl)]. The supplementary hexose unit was identified as 
b
-D- glucopyranose unit [
d
H-1
4.61 (d, 
J
¼ 7.6 Hz, glc' 
0
); 
d
C-1
104.3] (
Table 4
). As in 
1
, the cross-peaks observed in the HMBC spectrum between glc'-H-1/glc-C-6 (
d
C
68.1) and glc-H-1/aglycone-C-28 (
d
C
176.7) established the point of attachment of the disaccharide [glc'-(1 
+
6)-glc] to the C-28 of the aglycone. The HMBC correlation between glc' 
0
-H-1/rha'-C-4 (
d
C
82.3), rha'-H-1/xyl-C-3 (
d
C
81.7), xyl-H-1/rha-C-3 (
d
C
80.6), rha-H- 1/ara-C-2 (
d
C
74.9) and ara-H-1/aglycone-C-3 (
d
C
89.2) indicated that the pentasaccharide [glc' 
0
-(1 
+
4)-rha 
0
-(1 
+
3)-xyl-(1 
+

), deduced from the quazi-molecular ion peak at

in the HRESIMS spectrum (calcd for 1521.7089). The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra of 
4
displayed many similarities with those of 
3
, especially for the resonances assigned to oleanolic acid, three 
b
-D- glucopyranose units (glc, glc' and glc'

), two 
a
-L- rhamnopyranose units (rha and rha') and one 
b
-D- xylopyranose unit (xyl') (
Tables 2
and

). The identities of the monosaccharides were determined by a combination of 
1
H-

H- COSY, TOCSY, HSQC, HSQC-TOCSY, HMBC and ROESY NMR experiments. As in 
2
, starting from the anomeric proton at 
d
H-1
4.39 (d, 
J
¼ 7.1 Hz), 2D-NMR spectra analysis led to the assignment of the set of proton and carbon signals of a 2-monosubstituted 
b
-D- xylopyranose unit (xyl). Furthermore, all sites of glycosidations were also established by a HMBC experiment showing long-range correlations between glc'-H-1/glc-C-6, glc-H-1/aglycone-C-28, glc' 
0
-H-1/ rha'-C-4, rha'-H-1/xyl'-C-3, xyl'-H-1/rha-C-3, rha-H-1/xyl-C-2, and xyl-H-1/aglycone-C-3. Consequently, the structure of scabiostellatoside D (

Scabiostellatoside E (

the positive HRESIMS, corresponding to the molecular formula C

(calcd for 1521.7089), suggesting an additional hexose unit compared to 
1
. Comparing the NMR data of 
5
with those of 
3
(
Table 1
) showed that it had the same aglycone part (oleanolic acid). The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra of 
5
indicated the presence of seven sugar units which displayed seven anomeric protons and carbons, as in 
3
(
Table 2
). The detailed analysis of the 2D-NMR spectra led to the identification, as in 
3
, of one 
a
-L- arabinopyranosyl unit [
d
H-1
4.55 (d, 
J
¼ 6.9 Hz, ara)], two

H-1
5.26 (d,

J
¼ 7.8 Hz, glc'); 4.47 (d, 
J

)] (
Table 2
). The deshielded signal of the C-4 carbon (
d
C
78.1) (Δ þ10.4 ppm) of the 
a
-L- arabinopyranosyl residue in 
5
, when compared to this in 
3,
suggested that the glc' 
0
unit was attached to ara-C-4. An HMBC experiment made clear all interglycosidic connectivities showing correlations between glc'-H-1/glc-C-6 (
d
C
68.1), glc-H-1/aglycone-C-28 (
d
C
176.6), glc'

Scabiostellatoside F (
6
) had the same molecular formula of 
5
(C 
70
H

34
), deduced from the quazi-molecular ion peak at 
m/z
1521.7080 (calcd for C 
70
H 
114
O 
34
Na,1521.7089). Comparing the NMR data of 
6
with those of 
2
and 
4
(
Tables 3
and 
4
) and the analysis of the NMR spectra showed that 
6
was a heptasaccharide derivative of oleanolic acid [
d
C
88.9 (C-3); 179.8 (C-28)] (
Table 3
). The sugar part of 
6
consists of seven residues as evidenced by 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra which displayed seven anomeric proton and carbon signals, respectively (
Table 4
). Detailed analysis of the 2D-NMR spectra of 
6
and comparing its NMR data with those of 
2
and 
4
allowed identification of two 
b
-D- xylopyranosyl units [
d
H-1
4.40 (d, 
J
¼ 7.2 Hz, xyl); 4.47 (d, 
J
¼ 7.7 Hz, xyl')], two 
a
-L- rhamnopyranosyl units [
d
H-1
5.38 (d, 
J
¼ 1.7 Hz, rha); 5.21 (brs, rha')] and three 
b
-D- glucopyranosyl units [
d
H-1
4.48 (d, 
J
¼ 8.0 Hz, glc); 4.42 (d, 
J
¼ 7.9 Hz, glc'); 4.64 (d, 
J
¼ 7.9 Hz, glc'

)] (
Table 4
). The deshielded signals of glc-C-4 (
d
C
78.8) and glc' 
0
-C-4 (
d
C
79.1) suggested that both of them were 4- monosubstituted. This assumption was confirmed by the HMBC correlations observed between glc'-H-1/glc-C-4 (
d
C
78.8), and glc- H-1/glc' 
0
-C-4 (
d
C
79.1). In addition, the HMBC correlations observed between glc' 
0
-H-1/rha'-C-4 (
d
C
82.6) rha'-H-1/xyl'-C-3 (
d
C
81.7), xyl'-H-1/rha-C-3 (

Scabiostellatoside G (

H 
86
O 
25
(calcd for C 
54
H 
86
O 
25
Na, 1157.5356). The 
13
C NMR spectrum (
Table 5
) showed 54 carbon signals, of which 24 were assigned to four sugar moieties and 30 to the aglycone including six tertiary methyl groups at 
d
C
12.0 (C-24), 15.2 (C-25), 16.5 (C-26), 25.0 (C-27), 32.1 (C-29) and 22.6 (C-30), a hydroxymethyl carbon at 
d
C
63.4 (C-23), an oxygen-bearing methine carbon at 
d
C
82.3 (C-3) and an ester carbonyl group at 
d
C
175.7 (C-28). Furthermore, olefinic carbon signals appeared at 
d
C
122.4 (C-12) and 143.5 (C-13) which was also confirmed by the signal at 
d
H
5.27 (t, 
J
¼ 3.4 Hz) due to H- 
12 in
the 
1
H NMR spectrum. Taken together, these data were indicative of hederagenin (3 
b
,23-dihydroxy-12- oleanen-28-oic acid) (

; 

). This assumption was confirmed by analysis of the COSY, ROESY, HSQC and HMBC spectra which allowed the full assignment of the proton and carbon resonances of the aglycone (
Table 5
). A quick inspection of the 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra of 
7
indicated the presence of four monosaccharide units through the easily identifiable signals for their anomeric protons (
d
H
4.36, 4.56, 4.71 and 5.37) and carbons (
d
C
94.4, 102.8, 103.2 and 103.2). The analysis of COSY, TOCSY, ROESY, HSQC and HMBC experiments led to the identification of a 
b
-D- glucuronic acid unit starting from the anomeric proton at 
d
H
4.56 (d, 
J
¼ 7.5 Hz), characterized by the large vicinal couplings (±7.5 Hz) of H-1, H-2, H-3 and H-4, the H-5 doublet (
J
H-4,H-5
¼ 9.0 Hz) and the carboxyl C-6 at 
d
C
176.2 (
Table 6
). The NMR data showed a lowfield position of C-2 of the 
b
-D- glucuronic acid unit (
d
C
80.2) indicating it to be substituted at this position. From anomeric protons at 
d
H
5.37 (d, 
J
¼ 8.1 Hz), 4.36 (d, 
J
¼ 7.8 Hz) and 4.71 (d, 
J
¼ 7.7 Hz), three 
b
-D- glucopyranose units (glc, glc' and glc'

, respectively), were identified by the large coupling constants (
J
H-1,H-2
, 
J
H-2,H-3
, 
J
H-3,H-4
, and 
J
H-4,H-5
± 7.7 Hz) (
Table 6
). The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra of 
7
displayed many similarities with those of giganteoside M (3- 
O

), especially for the resonances assigned to hederagenin, 
b
-D- glucuronopyranosyl (glcA) and two 
b

b
-D- glucopyranose in 
7
and 
b

Scabiostellatoside H (

(calcd for 955.4828). The NMR spectra of

exhibited signals for a double bond [

Table 5
), which was trihydroxylated in positions C-2 
a
, C-3 
b
and C-23, as in asiatic acid (

). The large coupling constant between the vicinal diol H-2 and H-3 (
J
¼ 9.5 Hz) indicated that these protons adopted a quasi 
trans
-diaxial relationship. The location of the primary hydroxyl group (
d
H
3.30 and 3.70) at C-23 was deduced from the chemical shift of C-24 at 
d
C
13.6 characteristic of an axial position, and by comparison of the 
13
C NMR spectrum with that of asiatic acid (

). The 
a
-equatorial orientation of H-23 was confirmed by the correlations observed in the ROESY spectrum between H-23 and H-3 and H-5 and between H-3/H-5 and H-5/H-9 
a
-axial oriented. In the same manner, the ROESY correlations observed between H-2/H-24, H-25 and between H-25/ H-26, confirmed the 
b
-axial orientation of these 
CH
3
and H-2. The assignments of other proton and carbon signals of the aglycone were accomplished by extensive 2D-NMR analyses (
Table 5
). The

indicated the presence of three anomeric protons at

Compounds 
1—8
were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cell line by using the metabolic WST1 cell viability assay (

). Doxorubicin was used as a positive control (IC 
50
0.59 
±
0.05 µM). Among the tested compounds, the monodesmoside 
6
exhibited a moderate antiproliferative activity (IC 
50
12.0 
±
0.2 µM). The bidesmosides 
2
, 
4
and 
5
were less active (IC 
50
49.0 
±
0.7, 40.0 
±
0.7 and 38.0 
±
0.8 µM, respectively). The asiatic acid derivative (
8
) exhibited also a low cytotoxicity (IC 
50
40 
±
0.8 µM). Compounds 
1
, 
3
and 
7
were not active at the concentration of 50 µM. Comparison of IC 
50
values of compounds 
2
and 
4
with those of 
1
and 
3
suggested that the cytotoxic activity may be related to the nature of the sugar residue attached at C-3 of the aglycone; xylose in 
2
and 
4
and arabinose in 
1
and 
3
. Comparison of IC 
50
values of compounds 
3
and 
5
bearing an arabinose moiety attached to C-3 of aglycone suggested that the presence of a ramified sugar chain in 
5
(IC 
50
38.0 
±
0.8 µM) is more favorable to cytotoxic activity than a linear chain in 
3
.

were bidesmosides of hederagenin with glucuronic acid linked to C-3 of aglycone, and

3.5. Cell proliferation assay
</title>
         <p>
The fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080) were cultured in Minimum Essential Media (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin Streptomycin (PS) at 37 
ǫC
with 5% CO 
2
and harvested every three days for maintenance. Compounds 
1—8
were dissolved in DMSO. For treatment, cells were plated at a density of 10 
4
cells/mL in 24-well plates at 37 
ǫC
. After 24 h, the culture medium was discarded and cells were treated with the compounds in a fresh culture medium at various concentrations for 72 h, while the same dilution volume of DMSO was added in negative control wells. The concentration of DMSO did not exceed 0.1% to avoid significant toxicity on the tested cells. Therefore, the cells were washed once with 1 mL of D-PBS and then detached with 0.2% Trypsin/EDTA. Cell counting was carried out on a KOVA 
®
slide and with a phase contrast microscope as indicated by the manufacturer. Cell growth was calculated in percentage as the fraction of cell number in treated and control cells. IC 
50
was determined as the concentration of each compound which induced 50% inhibition of cell growth. The values represent averages of three independent experiments. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control agent.
