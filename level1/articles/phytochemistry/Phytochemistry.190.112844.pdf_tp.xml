         <p>
Plant parasitism by other plants, combined with abiotic environmental stress, offers a unique opportunity to study correlational nutritional relationships in terms of parasite–host interactions and their functional roles in nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Our study analysed the transfer of selected mineral elements, including heavy metals, from soil to different organs in hosts (
<tp:taxon-name>
Punica granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Fraxinus angustifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
) and from hosts to the expansive holoparasite (
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
) in cinnamonic soil habitats in 
Georgia
(Caucasus). We also identified other correlated trophic and bioactive effects in the parasite–host relationship. 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
was characterized by a high accumulation tendency for micro- and macroelements, such as K and Ca, and heavy metals, such as Zn, Ni, and Cd. Parasites can reduce the concentration of heavy metals in host tissues owing to this high accumulation tendency. In total, 85 compounds were identified in the examined parasite and its hosts. Despite the distinct phytochemical content of species of the infected host, the parasite produced specific metabolites with dominant phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs), with acteoside and crenatoside being the primary dominant compounds - ca. 98% of all polyphenols. Polyphenols in parasite specimens that are correlated with Cu and Zn are antagonistic to polyphenols correlated with Fe, Pb, Cr, and Ni. The profile of polyphenols in the host species was both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct from the profile of the compounds in the parasite and between hosts (only acteoside in group PhGs was common between the parasite and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Fraxinus
</tp:taxon-name>
host), which indicates the existence of a unique compound biosynthesis pathway in the parasite. Our results demonstrated that the parasite, particularly in its flowers, exhibited higher polyphenol content, antioxidative effects (ABTS-+, DPPH, and FRAP), and inhibitory effects.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
With approximately 4750 species grouped in 26 families, parasitic plants account for 1,6% of all angiosperms (

). Parasitic plants are components of almost all terrestrial vegetation 
types
(

). In plants, the parasitic lifestyle is characterized by developing an intrusive organ called a haustorium, a vascular bridge that connects the two plants that also acts on attachment and host tissue penetration (

) and absorbs water and nutrients from host-plant vascular tissue. Holoparasites (no photosynthesis and chlorophyll absent) have lower transpiration rates than hemiparasites (photoautotrophic and chlorophyll present) because holoparasites are underground for most of their lifecycle; even after emergence, they do not photosynthesize due to the lack of leaves necessary for effective transpiration (

; 

). Holoparasites infect both the phloem and xylem of the host tissue and rely on the host to supply both organic and inorganic nutrients (

). Haustorium cells metabolize host-derived nutrients, creating a parasite-specific metabolic profile (

; 

; P´eron et al., 2016), which may be completely different in holoparasites
</p>
         <p>
when compared to hosts, particularly regarding polyphenols (

, 

).
</p>
         <p>
Parasitism represents the most extreme interaction between plants, and plant parasitism offers a unique opportunity to study correlational nutritional relationships (

). Interestingly, parasites generally accumulate more inorganic and organic compounds than their hosts, which has a notable effect on subsequent processes and associated mechanisms (

; 

; 

). Therefore, holoparasites lower their water potentials by accumulating high levels of osmotically active compounds such as mineral ions, sugars, and sugar alcohols (

). The gradient of the water potential between the host and the parasite is a driving force for water flow (

). However, many questions remain about this process, especially regarding which 
types
of materials are translocated from host to parasite, whether the parasite is selective in extracting certain compounds and excluding others, and how the parasite uses the acquired material, including toxic compounds (

). An interesting and poorly understood phenomenon is the relation between the parasitic lifestyle in plants and resistance against toxic trace elements in polluted soils. Parasites can reduce the concentration of heavy metals in the host due to their high accumulation tendencies. However, identifying the mechanism by which this occurs and determining whether compounds withdrawn from the host are already chelated to reduce toxicity prior to parasite uptake, whether the parasite has specific chelating mechanisms, or whether parasitic plants may play a role in bioremediation in removing metals, salt, or other soil contaminants are still required (

; 

; 

; 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Parasites can be considered keystone species because they influence the individual growth, reproduction, and allometry of other species, as well as ecosystems and ecological communities through their effects on trophic interactions in abiotic compounds and other organisms (

). It is also interesting that hyperparasitic interactions between parasitic plants may affect not only the ecology of individual species or nutrient sharing but also modulate their ecosystem impacts (

). Some parasites are allogenic engineers that change the environment by transforming materials from one physical state to another, particularly in nutrient-poor communities, from less available forms into more labile forms (

). Parasitic plants also tend to have much higher nutrient concentrations than their hosts (

), usually several times the N and P in the leaves of root hemiparasites (

, 

, 

; 

). Thus, they have considerable impacts on local biogeochemical cycling due to their enriched and easily decomposed litter (

). If we look at parasitic plants not only through the prism of dependence and parasite–host interaction, we can easily see moderators of the entire ecosystem in them, particularly by enriching the environment with minerals.

            <tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>
is the largest and most widely distributed family of root-parasitic angiosperms, with 102 genera and over 2100 species (

). Despite relatively low biomass, many species in this family negatively affect hosts, particularly invasive species in crops. However, most occur in seminatural habitats, and some 
<tp:taxon-name>form large</tp:taxon-name>
populations affecting multiple hosts, communities, and other trophic levels. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
L. (incl. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phelipanche
Pomel
</tp:taxon-name>
) is the most diverse and numerous holoparasitic genus in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>
family, with over 200 described species (

). More than 70 natural products have been described from species in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
s.l.
; however, only ca. thirty species were subjected to phytochemical analysis (

; 

). Holoparasitic 
<tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>
are a rich source of metabolites belonging to the phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs), which have been reported to exhibit multiple biological and medicinal effects (

). Owing to their unique properties, some holoparasitic species, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cistanche
Hoffmanns &amp; Link
</tp:taxon-name>
, are considered for cultivation in specific regions of 
China
due to their long-term use in traditional Chinese medicine (

; 

). Recently, the use of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
as food and medicine has been gaining increasing interest (

). However, the amount and bioactivity of the polyphenolic compounds found in these parasites are very diverse and depend on both the host plant and organs of the parasite and environmental factors such as altitude (

, 

). Recent studies have clearly shown that holoparasitic 
<tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, particularly 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
s.l.
, can accumulate significant amounts of toxic metals (

; 

; 

). Parasitic plants are most often obtained for herbal medicine from natural or seminatural habitats that appear to be unpolluted; however, they can grow in mountain areas with a natural share of metal-rich soils, bedrock, or saline desert areas. In areas with soils that are naturally rich in toxic metals, the circulation of elements is often disturbed, and there is a shortage of water; however, deep-rooted hosts have access to the water table (

).

appears to be polyphagous (infecting many unrelated host species) as the most expansive holoparasite species of the roots of trees in the Caucasus (Western Asia). It has been listed from the natural or seminatural forest and shrub habitats. However, our recent observations in horticulture and arboriculture suggest an important economic influence since it may spread to adjacent forest communities and cultivated areas and it has the potential to easily adapt to many different host trees. This is particularly notable because parasite populations can produce several thousand shoots (

, 2021) and indirectly affect local ecosystems.

To date, the chemical and mineral composition of

has not been evaluated, and our study opens doors for its exploitation as a functional food and pharmacologic and therapeutic agent; moreover, this analysis elucidates the influence of host and contaminated soils on harvested parasitic herbs. We examined two localities, both in wooded communities, within the range of cinnamonic soils (fertile clay soils rich in humus) in 
Georgia
(Caucasus) exhibiting significant concentrations of toxic metals in the soil. The objectives of our study were to (I) determine the accumulation and translocation of micro- and macroelements with toxic metals from soil to particular plant organs (in both the hosts and the parasite); (II) evaluate the nutritional value, phytochemical composition, and bioactivity of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
by comparing particular organs and of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. angustifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
by evaluating various organs in plants from different localities; (III) determine whether the compounds identified were synthesized by holoparasites or obtained from their host plants; (IV) determine whether the host species affects the qualitative and quantitative composition of parasitic polyphenols and bioactivity; and (V) evaluate the function of holoparasites in wooded ecosystems as keystone species, highlighting their potential effects on nutrient cycling.

parasitizing their root systems were grown in fertile humus-rich loamy cinnamonic soils. These soils were characterized by neutral pH and low
</p>
         <p>
salt concentrations. The soils from Sighnaghi were significantly richer in Mg, K, and P, while those from Antoki were rich in Ca (
Table 1
, 
Fig. 1
). Soils contaminated with heavy metals can result in higher concentrations of these metals in plants. In arable soils, Cu levels should not exceed 
25–40 mg
/ 
1000 g
(Gruca-Kr´olikowska and 

). In the studied soils, the highest Cu content was found in Sighnaghi soil (
39.42 mg
/ 
1000 g
). The high amount of Ca in the studied soils may have caused the low level of available Cu in the soil. In soils, the content of Zn permitted is up to 
100 mg
/ 
1000 g
(

). It was at 
115 mg
/ 
1000 g
in soils from Sighnaghi. The Antoki site was characterized by a much higher Zn content (
225.72 mg
/ 
1000 g
). Ni is a toxic element with a high rate of accumulation by plants. High content of this element was found in the investigated soils (
72.54–102.73 mg
/ 
1000 g
). This resulted in its high concentration in the analysed parts of the hosts and parasite. In soils, the average Cr content is 
30–40 mg
/ 
1000 g
, which is acceptable for agricultural use (

). In Sighnaghi soil, the Cr concentration reached 
49.89 mg
/ 
1000 g
, which may lead to increased uptake by plants. In Sighnaghi and Antoki soils, Cd was present in small, natural amounts (

0.240
–0.412
mg

/ 
1000 g
). In the studied soils, Pb was also present in natural amounts (17.49 and 
23.71 mg
/ 
1000 g
), indicating benignity to local plants (

). Cobalt occurs in clay soils up to 
12 mg
/ 
1000 g
(Kabata-- Pendias and Pendias, 1999). Sighnaghi and Antoki soils were rich in Co at different levels (9.32 and 
12.80 mg
/ 
1000 g
, respectively) (
Tables 1
and 
2
).

         <p>
The content of macroelements and heavy metals in the soil has a direct influence on plant uptake. Individual species have physiologically determined needs for macro- and microelements, but in general, they take up them in proportion to their soil content. Higher elemental content in the soil did not generally lead to higher uptake by the host. 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
leaves exhibited lower concentrations of Mg, Ca, K, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Zn than the leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. angustifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Table 3
). However, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
accumulated more K, Ca, Fe, and toxic Cr, Co, Cd, Pb, and Ni when parasitizing 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
than when parasitizing 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. angustifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Table 3
). We also found that flowers of 

<tp:taxon-name>O. laxissima</tp:taxon-name>
,

regardless of host species, accumulated more Mg, Ca, Ni, and Zn and less Co and Fe than the stems of this species (
Table 3
, 
Fig. 1
). The indicator organs of the parasites were characterized by a minimal ability to uptake Ca from the hosts. In the leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. angustifolia,
Ca
</tp:taxon-name>
was 
14.49 g
/ 
1000 g
, but in the stem of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
parasitizing it, the concentration was more than ten times lower (
1.37 g
/ 
1000 g
).
</p>
         <p>
The bioaccumulation of metals in the examined parasite largely depended on the host species and organs. 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
is characterized by a high microelement and heavy metal accumulation tendency. The flowers and stems of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
strongly accumulated Cr in relation to the 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
host (bioaccumulation factor
&gt;
10) and Fe, Cd, and Ni, as well as Pb and Zn (bioaccumulation factor 1–10). However, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
parasitizing 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. angustifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
accumulated Ni, Zn, Cu, and Fe in its flowers (
Fig. 2
).
</p>
         <p>
Additionally, our results also indicate an interesting relationship between the content of some elements in the soil–host–parasite ecological community, specifically considering the potential for human involvement in this system. The circulation of toxic heavy metals is particularly important. Holoparasites from the 
<tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>
are widely used in herbal medicine, and the proven bioaccumulation capacity of some heavy metals requires better scientific recognition. Cu was present in both host and parasite specimens in amounts up to 
12.4 mg
/ 
1000 g
. The uptake of Cu by the host was not related to the soil concentration. In contrast, Cu uptake by 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
was proportional to the content in the host. The flowers of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
parasitizing 
<tp:taxon-name>
Fraxinus
</tp:taxon-name>
exhibited Cu accumulation (
11.62 mg
/ 
1000 g
). Cu levels exceeding 
20 mg
/ 
1000 g
in food products are toxic to humans. However, Cu deficiency in humans is more unfavourable than excessive consumption, as it disturbs many biological processes (

). The RDA of Cu, according to the Age-Related 

and 

, is 
0.7–0.9 mg
, and the upper limit is 
10 mg
(

). The soils from Antoki were significantly richer in Zn than those from Sighnaghi. This was translated into a significantly higher uptake of this element by the host 
<tp:taxon-name>
Fraxinus
</tp:taxon-name>
and the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
parasitizing it. The highest Zn concentration was found in the flowers of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
(up to 
45.84 mg
/ 
1000 g
). In contrast, the content in the stem was significantly lower than that in the host. There are no standards defining the acceptable level of Zn in food products. It is considered necessary in low amounts for the proper functioning of living organisms. The daily human requirement for zinc is 
15–20 mg
(

). According to 

, it would be unwise to exceed a daily intake of 
30 mg
in adults. Ni is a toxic element with a high accumulation factor in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
. Found its high concentration in the analysed parts of hosts (3.01–4.06) and the parasite (
4.05–4.99 mg
/ 
1000 g
). The average Ni content in fresh foods is 
0.079 mg
/ 
1000 g
(

) and should not exceed 
0.5 mg
/ 
1000 g
(GB 2762–2012). Population exposure to nickel from food has decreased since 1976 (
0.33 mg
/day), and it has been relatively stable since 1982– 
0.13 mg
/day in the 2006 TDS (

). Notably, high levels of this element indicate that consuming a small amount of stem of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
may pose a threat to human health. Despite the low level of Cr in the leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
(
0.06 mg
/ 
1000 g
), the Cr content in the stem of the parasite reached 
1.09 mg
/ 
1000 mg
. The translocation factor, which is the ratio between the metal content of the plant and the soil, is calculated to determine the degree of bioaccumulation. In this case, the bioaccumulation index was 18.1. In the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
flowers (Sighnaghi, parasite on 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
), Cr was at an even higher level of 
1.64 mg
(bioaccumulation index 27.3). In fresh vegetables and fruit of other species, the average Cr level has been reported to be 

0.007
–0.008
mg

/ 
1000 g
(

). The daily requirement of an adult human for Cr is 
0.2 mg
/day (

). The host plants and flowers of the parasite contained a typical Cd amount for most plants (
0.2 mg
/ 
1000 g
). However, in the stem of the parasite, the amounts of Cd were approximately tenfold higher at 1.85 and 
2.53 mg
/ 
1000 g
when parasitizing 
<tp:taxon-name>
Fraxinus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Punica
</tp:taxon-name>
hosts, respectively. For plants, the toxic amounts of Cd range
&gt;
3 mg
/ 
1000 g
(

); however, in food products, they should not exceed 
0.2 mg
/ 
1000 g
(Journal of Laws 37/326). Humans should not consume more than 
0.007 mg
/kg body weight - weekly dose. Plants take up Co in proportion to their content in the soil (

). The leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
contained most of the Co (
0.41 mg
/ 
1000 g
). Tested 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
also contained small amounts of Co regardless of host species, up to 
0.36 mg
/ 
1000 g
. These amounts are much smaller than those in fruits, vegetables, and grains (

). Cobalt is an essential element for animal organisms. Humans consume an average of 
0.04–0.05 mg
Co a day, and its absorption is 50%. One-time consumption of high concentrations of Co (
25–30 mg
) is toxic to humans (

). The host plants contained traces of Pb (
0.01 mg
/ 
1000 g
). A very low level of Pb was also

Soils with high heavy metal contents provide very restrictive habitats for plants due to phytotoxicity, resulting in severe selection pressures and the rise of genetically altered ecotypes with specific tolerances to heavy metals that adapt through microevolutionary processes (

). Parasites, particularly obligate parasites, could provide a better understanding of the biological availability of pollutants in ecosystems. The accumulation of heavy metals in the indicator parts of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
was higher than that tolerated in most plants, which indicates that it is resistant to the negative effects associated with these elements. It is also worth emphasizing that the holoparasite we investigated, similar to most parasites in relation to the size of the hosts, has a much lower biomass than its tree hosts, thus not having a large area across which these metals could be distributed or diluted. It can be assumed that the uptake of excessive amounts of heavy metals from the host may function as a protective effect for the host. Parasites can also modify the host’ s physiological or biochemical response to contamination in different directions, as both stressors can act synergistically (parasite plus contaminants) or antagonistically. Interestingly, animal parasites have been reported to be pollutant sinks, such as tapeworm-infected fish that exhibited lower heavy metal contents than noninfected fish (

). This raises the question of whether parasites alter the dynamics of contaminants in the trophic cycle and how this affects the health and interaction of organisms; as another example, the Cd content may be several thousand times higher in tapeworms and nematodes than in the tissues of their host (

). Holoparasites are nonphotosynthetic and, therefore, less sensitive to heavy metals. High heavy metal concentrations in the soil can be toxic to the host. However, the strong uptake by the parasite, as indicated by the high accumulation factor, reduces its concentration in the host plant, thus reducing its negative impact on physiology.
</p>
         <p>
The uptake of large amounts of heavy metals by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
can serve several functions. Heavy metals can help the host function in a contaminated environment. Uptake by the parasite reduces the concentration of heavy metals in the plant. Such a relationship was also found in the examined 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
. In addition, 

pointed to the reallocation of toxic metals from the host tissue to the parasite stem. This suggests that the parasite may play an important role in lowering the concentration of metals. Heavy metals can also play an important role in the development of the parasite. Their accumulation capacity can give them an advantage over others and affect other species and ecosystems, such as by elemental allelopathy (e.g., for some microbes and pathogens). They can increase drought resistance, influence neighbours (interference/allelopathy), or provide defence against natural enemies (

; 

; 

). It is possible that high quantities of heavy metals (or metabolites) are toxic or unsavoury to animals and pathogens (

). It has also been noted that animals only eat parts of hyperaccumulating plants that contain the least amount of heavy metals, such as seeds (

). The first author’ s long-term observations show that the holoparasitic 
<tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>
are very resistant to insect pests or fungal diseases, and they are usually not eaten by herbivores. Apart from the ability to accumulate and tolerate metals (not every habitat is their source), resistance to insects and pathogens is probably more influenced by metabolites characteristic of these holoparasites, namely, polyphenols (specifically phenylethanoid glycosides; see Subsection 3.2). It was found that the biosynthesis of polyphenols, such as flavonoids, is strongly enhanced in plants owing to excessive metal content. Organic acids and amino acids also play an important role in metal tolerance (

). Some species that grow next to metal-accumulating plants may benefit from this neighbourhood, that is, protection against pathogens and herbivores, including the soil around these plants, and the mulch formed from parasites is much richer in metals (

). It has been shown that trees absorb Ni from deep soil layers and accumulate it in leaves, which then increases Ni levels in the upper soil layers as the leaves fall (

). High soil concentrations can inhibit the sprouting and growth of other competing plants (Mehdavi et al., 2011), creating favourable conditions for organisms to tolerate metals (

). Heavy metals can be chelated in the cytosol and compartmentalized, for example, in vacuoles, apoplastic space, or epidermal trichomes (

). Trichomes are found densely on flowers or stems with scales in most holoparasitic 
<tp:taxon-name>Orobanchaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, but their role in accumulating or removing metals requires further research.
</p>
         <p>
Evaluating parasite–host interactions can offer novel insights into correlational nutritional relationships (

). In hemiparasitic species, litter often has higher concentrations of foliar nutrients than their hosts, for example, two-to fourfold greater for N and P, potentially making more resources available to co-occurring species in the vicinity of the hemiparasite (

). The effects of hemiparasites on productivity and diversity should depend on whether the parasite more significantly reduces host growth (parasitism) or increases nutrient cycling (litter effects) (

). A recent study presented

L. (

) in polluted sites exhibit high Zn and Pb concentrations and low Fe/Cu ratios in shoot tissue without developing toxicity symptoms, but further analysis is needed to clarify whether tolerance may be achieved by transfer of these elements in chelated, less toxic forms from the metal-tolerant host or by specific mechanisms existing in the parasite (

). Moreover, facultative 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. lutea
</tp:taxon-name>
accumulates 1.5 times more K than its host, while obligate parasites have four-to fivefold higher content in comparison with their hosts (

). Despite different rates of xylem utilization in different species, obligate parasites, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Striga
Lour.
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
appear to reach the same level of K accumulation (

). Other minerals, such as Ca, Mg, and Na, were also reported to have the highest concentrations in holoparasites (

), but these rarely accumulate to levels higher than those in the host. Lower Mg concentrations in parasite specimens in our study are similar to those reported in other studies and may be due to a lack of chlorophyll (

). However, a lack of change in host nutrient concentrations should not be considered indicative of a non-detrimental impact and may be maintained by reduced host growth (

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
infection reduces host biomass and growth, as well as elemental composition, particularly in leaves (e.g., 

; 

; 

; 

). In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
, an obligate holoparasite, all nutrients required for development must be derived from the host phloem and are expected to take up minerals only from its host (

) because haustoria of these parasites lack a root hair zone, making them unable to take up water and mineral compounds from the soil (

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
exhibited higher P and K concentrations and lower N, Ca, and Mg than the hosts, suggesting selective mineral absorption (

). This confirms the observation of 

, who also found high K and P concentrations in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Orobanche
</tp:taxon-name>
. Our study showed similar results, with K at a higher concentration in parasites, but P was at a similar level in hosts. Moreover, the higher amount of K in the parasite might be related to the fact that K is transferred from host to parasite together with organic metabolites (

), which may also be related to the absorption of other minerals.

2.2. Polyphenol content
</title>
         <p>
The results showed that the content of polyphenolic compounds in the parasite specimens were dependent upon on the 
type
of host and morphological parts (
Table 4
). Thus, the content of the polyphenolic compounds in parasite on 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
host was 1.5 times lower than in parasite on 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. angustifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
host. The average amount of bioactive compounds in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
host was 1.3 times higher than in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. angustifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
host. Such differences can be due to the content of the polyphenolic compounds identified on the host plant. The parasite, irrespective of the host, was dominated by PhGs, particularly acteoside. It was at a higher level in flowers (3273 and 
5095 mg
/ 
100 g
) than in stems (2105 and 
3781 mg
/ 
100 g
). Similar relationships were found in several parasites collected in 
Poland
. They were also dominated by acteoside (

). Similar observations were reported for

<tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>

920 mg

100 g
DW (

). Moreover, the average amount of analysed compounds in 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
was 1.4 times higher in the flowers than in the stem. The stem of 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
(L.) Cout.; the authors noted that the dominant metabolites observed in the flowers were glycoside and bartsioside, that in the stems was primarily acteoside, and those in the roots were echinacoside and tubuloside A (

). Among the identified compounds, PhGs (mainly acteoside and crenatoside) were dominant compounds and accounted for 97.8% of all polyphenols on average. Moreover, flavonols (2%), and phenolic acid (0.2%) were the predominant observed flavonoids. According to 

, PhGs were predominantly identified in the parasite of

<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
host, while no acid was identified in the host itself. PhGs substances are abundant in medical plants as well as traditional Chinese medicines, and they exhibit anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antibacterial, antioxidant, antivirus, cytotoxic, and immunomodulatory characteristics (

</tp:taxon-name>
and fruits and leaves of 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. angustifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
, which exhibited different profiles of polyphenolic compounds. This indicates a unique biosynthesis pathway for polyphenols. Acteoside is the only compound present in the parasite and host 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. angustifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
, and this compound was likely not taken up from the host by the parasite because acteoside is present in both species (

). The host actoside content was significantly lower (221 and 
415 mg
/ 
100 g
) than that of the parasite (
2105–5095 mg
/ 
100 g
). The results of colour analysis of the tested species suggest that host plants may influence the colour of indicator elements of the parasite and are presented in the Supplementary Materials (

).
</p>
         <p>
However, the predominant compounds in the flowers of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
host were hydrolysable tannins (accounting for 95% of all polyphenols), with flavonoids accounting for 5%, while hydrolysable tannins in the leaves accounted for 100%. In the fruits and leaves of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. angustifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
host, the major compounds include phenylethanoid glucosides and flavonols, which accounted for 38% and 34% of all compounds, respectively. The content of polyphenols in the flowers of both hosts was similar, whereas in the leaves of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
host, the amount of polyphenols was 2 times higher than that in the leaves of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
F. angustifolia
</tp:taxon-name>
host (
Fig. 3
). This difference was observed due to the specificity of the tested hosts in synthesizing different amounts of polyphenols (

; 

; Fale´et al., 2013). According to 

, the polyphenol content in the flowers of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
was 
944.75 mg
GA/g DW and was 1.7 times lower in the flowers of the parasite. In turn, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
peel in the study by 

, 2011b) contained 6.4 and 5.3 times more polyphenols than in the flowers and leaves of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granatum
</tp:taxon-name>
host. Recent data have presented some evidence for the sequestration of metabolites, such as alkaloids, flavonoids, and iridoid glycosides, by some hemi- and holoparasites from their host species (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Moreover, the results showed that the higher the amount of polyphenols in the parasite was, the higher the antiradical activity, reducing activity, and high the ability to inhibit the activity of α- amylase and α- glucosidase (
Table 5
). Many authors have confirmed such dependencies (

; 

). However, a higher scavenging ability of reactive oxygen species can be observed when they are complexed with metals than with polyphenols alone, particularly flavonols (

). In addition, the results showed that more polyphenols in the parasite and host affected the high accumulation of Cu and Zn and lowered the accumulation of Fe. However, further research investigation is required to validate this relationship. This result may be due to the ability of the flavonol pathway to accumulate metals and create complexes with polyphenols. Organic acids and amino acids, which play a role in metal tolerance and hyperaccumulation, have recently been suggested for flavonoids. Flavonoids are phenolic compounds characterized by two benzene rings linked by a heterocyclic pyran ring and are primarily found in plants as 
O
-glycosides. Flavonoid biosynthesis is strongly enhanced in plants by excess metal (

). In turn, the stability of metal-polyphenol complexes depends on pH, and several polyphenols exhibit a higher metal-binding ability at pH 7 (cytosolic pH) than at pH 5.5 (vacuolar pH) (

). Depending on the pH, flavonoids may play a significant role in chelating metals in various cell organelles (

). According to Kova´ˇcik et al. (2008), polyphenolic metabolism is a complex compendium that shows constant dynamics of action. This process provides constant protection of plant tissues against oxidative stress induced by excess metals (Kova´ˇcik et al., 2008).
</p>
         <p>
PhGs may be considered specialized metabolites synthesized by parasitic species because they are not typically present in host species (

); this likely occurs owing to the existence of a unique biosynthetic pathway, particularly in obligate parasites. Holoparasites, which are completely dependent on their hosts for nutrients, create different 
types
of metabolites after their uptake; this process may affect other species and the whole ecosystem after litter decomposition. Moreover, PhGs play protective, antimicrobial, antistress, or resistance roles in plants (Jim´enez and 

).

PCA for minerals and phenolic content of plants explained 86.16% of the total variance, with PC1 representing 58.12% and PC2 representing 28.04% (
Fig. 4
). The statistical method pointed out three major parts. Our results show that there were many correlations between antioxidant capacity and mineral extractability. PCA demonstrated a close relationship between polyphenols 1, 3, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16 and Cu and Zn. Polyphenols 5 and 6 were found to be poorly related to Cu, as were polyphenols 2 and 17 to Zn. A relationship among Ni, Cr, and, to a lesser extent, Pb was observed with polyphenols 4, 9, 17, 18, and 19 (
Fig. 4
). A strong positive correlation between Fe and polyphenol 7 was also found. The increase in Cd and Co content limited the amount of polyphenols. Two of the studied polyphenols, 5 and 6, were not related to heavy metal content. Moreover, polyphenols that are correlated with Cu and Zn were antagonistic to polyphenols correlated with Fe, Pb, Cr, and Ni. Few studies have shown that polyphenols can chelate metals (

; Kova´ˇcik et al., 2008).

Other studies have demonstrated higher scavenging activity on DPPH and ABTS- + radicals for stems compared to flowers (

Other authors also indicated that the antioxidant capacity is strongly correlated with the content of phenolic compounds, which confirms their dominant role (

A significant difference was found in the nitrate content, particularly in the indicator parts of the parasite in comparison with the hosts. The host leaves contained a nitrate concentration that was approximately seven times higher than that of the parasite stem (

3. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
In this study, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
was characterized by a high accumulation capacity of micro- and macroelements, including heavy metals (particularly Zn, Ni, and Cd). This bioaccumulation depended on the examined organ of the parasite and the species of the host which it parasitizes. Higher elemental concentrations in the soil were correlated with increased uptake by plants. The profile of polyphenols in the host species was both qualitatively and quantitatively different from the profile of the compounds in the parasite. Increased accumulation of elements, including parasites, and the production of specific metabolites (in our case, PhGs) may have an enhanced protective effect against drought, pest, herbivore, and disease damage (

; 

; 

). Moreover, polyphenols of parasites that are correlated with Cu and Zn are antagonistic to polyphenols correlated with Fe, Pb, Cr, and Ni. Our research indicates that parasites respond to disturbances in the ecosystem and can provide valuable information about the dynamics of the host-parasite relationship as well as the health of the ecosystem in response to pollution. Further research is required to determine whether parasites can be used as indicators of ecosystem stress and metalliferous soils. Soil environmental contamination can also suppress the immune response of host plants, thereby leading to an increase in the intensity of infection by the parasite due to synergistic effects. Similarly, pollution might not directly affect mistletoe growth on trees but makes them more susceptible to mistletoe infection (Kołodziejek et al., 2012). Parasites can reduce the content of heavy metals in the host. Parasites may help to provide a better understanding of the biological availability of pollutants in ecosystems. Parasites can be considered a keystone species, as parasitism itself as well as the ability of parasites to accumulate and convert high amounts of organic and inorganic compounds (in our case, PhGs) via distinct biochemical pathways affects parasite–host relationships as well as the entire ecosystem. Some mutualistic effects have been observed on trophic interactions in abiotic environments and other organisms (

). Future investigation into these relationships is needed, such as holoparasite litter and its impact on soil microbes or higher trophic levels. 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
is the most common plant parasite in forest and scrub communities. It is the most expansive holoparasitic species in the Caucasus, with its individual populations having up to several thousand shoots. Hence, it can act as a moderator of trophic dependencies and the structure of communities, both during its flowering and active parasitizing process and after the decomposition of nutrient-rich litter, thus affecting the entire ecosystem. 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. laxissima
</tp:taxon-name>
also has high bioactive potential; however, before medical use, it must be tested for heavy metal content or specifically cultivated for human consumption owing to its strong accumulation properties. Such accumulation characteristics have also been shown in studies of other holoparasitic species. They may be related to the physiology of holoparasites.

</p>
         <p>
Both localities occurred within the cinnamonic soil (Cambisols Chromic) range, which is clearly defined on the 
Georgia
map and included as a memorial group of the soils in The Red Book of Soils of 
Georgia
(

). Cinnamonic soils are distributed in the forest-steppe zone of East 
Georgia
, mainly at altitudes of 500 (700)– 900 (1300) a.s.l., 4.8% (311600 ha) of the total territory. These soils are characterized by dark-brown and brown colours of humus horizons, small lumps and grainy structures, weakly alkaline or neutral reactions, moderate contents of humus, a negative water balance, a distinct clay mation process, predominant silicate iron on nonsilicates, horizons with clay formation and calcium carbonates throughout the profile (
