The metabolism of the phytoalexin rapalexin 
A
, a unique indole isothiocyanate (ITC) produced by crucifers (family 
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicaceae</tp:taxon-name>
), was investigated. Three phytopathogenic fungal species were examined: 
<tp:taxon-name>
Colletotrichum dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
(Pers.:Fr.) Grove, a broad host range pathogen, 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
Sacc.
</tp:taxon-name>
, a host-selective pathogen of crucifers and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. lentis
Damm
</tp:taxon-name>
, a host-selective pathogen of lentils (
<tp:taxon-name>
Lens culinaris
Medik.
</tp:taxon-name>
). The metabolism of rapalexin 
A
by 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
was similar, taking place via one common intermediate and two divergent pathways, but 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. lentis
</tp:taxon-name>
was unable to transform rapalexin 
A
. Both 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
transformed rapalexin 
A
to two previously undescribed metabolites, the structures of which were confirmed by chemical synthesis: 
N
-acetyl-S-(8-methoxy-4 

H

-thiazolo[5,4-b]indol-2-yl)-L-cysteine and 4-hydroxy-3-(4- methoxy-1 

H

-indol-3-yl)-2-thioxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid. That is, both fungal pathogens metabolized and detoxified rapalexin 
A
by addition of the thiol group of L-Cys residue to the isothiocyanate carbon of rapalexin 
A
, a transformation usually catalyzed by glutathione transferases. Coincidentally, this metabolic pathway is employed by mammals and insects to detoxify isothiocyanates and other xenobiotics. Hence, 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
could be a useful model fungus to uncover genes involved in the detoxification pathways of ITCs and related xenobiotics. Our overall results suggest that increasing rapalexin 
A

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Cruciferous phytoalexins occupy a unique chemical space due to a variety of functional groups that contain distinct arrangements of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur atoms in a relatively simple carbon skeleton (

). The phytoalexin rapalexin 
A
(
1
) is in a unique position within this group of plant defenses in that, together with rapalexin 
B
(
1a
), are the first indolyl isothiocyanates (ITCs) reported from plants (

). Similar to other plants, crucifers under stress biosynthesize 
de novo
antimicrobial metabolites known as phytoalexins, which are involved in fighting microbial invaders including phytopathogenic fungi (

). Stresses such as pathogen attack, UV radiation or heavy metals can elicit phytoalexins in different plant organs, e.g. leaves, stems or roots (

). Crucifers (order 
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicales</tp:taxon-name>
, family 
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicaceae</tp:taxon-name>
) including broccoli (
<tp:taxon-name>
Brassica oleracea
var. 
italica
</tp:taxon-name>
L.), cauliflower (
<tp:taxon-name>
B. oleracea
var. 
botrytis
</tp:taxon-name>
L.), canola (
<tp:taxon-name>
B. napus
</tp:taxon-name>
L. and 
<tp:taxon-name>
B. rapa
</tp:taxon-name>
L.) and brown mustard (
<tp:taxon-name>
B. juncea
</tp:taxon-name>
L.), are agronomically important crops cultivated
</p>
         <p>
worldwide that produce rapalexin 
A
(
1
).
</p>
         <p>
In crucifers, ITCs are derived from glucosinolates (GLCs) via reactions catalyzed by myrosinases (thioglucoside glucohydrolases, E.C. 3.2.1.147) (
Fig. 1
). GLCs are derived from amino acids biosynthesized in plants of the order 
<tp:taxon-name>Brassicales</tp:taxon-name>
and are readily recognized by their distinct functional group, an 
S
-β-D-glucopyranosyl- 

O

-sulfatethiohydroximate. ITCs and GLCs have important ecological functions that include protection against pests and diseases (

). In addition to their ecological roles, ITCs have been widely investigated due to their chemopreventive activities in mammals (

). Indeed, numerous human epidemiological studies have established that the anticarcinogenic activity of cruciferous vegetables is mainly due to the high content of specific ITCs (

).
</p>
         <p>
The detoxification of phytoalexins by phytopathogenic fungi 
in planta
decreases the concentrations of essential defenses and facilitates successful microbial invasion. Importantly, it has been shown in several instances that fungal plant pathogens detoxify cruciferous phytoalexins using different reactions and that the 
type
of reaction (e.g. oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis) or pathways depend on both the fungal species and the chemical structure of the phytoalexin (

; 

). For example, the cruciferous phytoalexin brassinin (
2
) is detoxified by phytopathogenic fungi to indolyl-3-methanamine (
4
) (in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Alternaria brassicicola
(Schwein.) Wiltshire
</tp:taxon-name>
) and indole-3-carboxaldehyde (
3
) (in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Leptosphaeria maculans
(Desm.) Ces. et Not.
</tp:taxon-name>
, asexual stage 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phoma lingam
(Tode ex Fr.) Desm.
</tp:taxon-name>
), whereas rapalexin 
A
(
1
) is not transformed by either pathogen (
Fig. 2
) (

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Rapalexin 
A
(
1
) resistance to detoxification by two economically important crucifer fungal pathogens suggests that increasing its biosynthesis in crucifer species could improve disease resistance levels to some pathogens. However, to understand the magnitude and implications of this resistance to detoxification, it is necessary to investigate additional phytopathogenic fungal species. Toward this end, because the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Colletotrichum
</tp:taxon-name>
comprises fungal species with diverse host ranges (O'Connell et al., 2012; 

), the transformation of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) by three 
<tp:taxon-name>
Colletotrichum
species
</tp:taxon-name>
was studied: (i) 
<tp:taxon-name>
Colletotrichum dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
(Pers.:Fr.) Grove, a generalist pathogen that infects a wide range of plant spp. (e.g. 
Madagascar
periwinkle (

, a host-selective pathogen and a model species (O'Connell et al., 2012) that infects crucifers causing anthracnose lesions on kimchi cabbage (

<tp:taxon-name>
C. lentis

</tp:taxon-name>
(previously misidentified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. truncatum

), a host-selective pathogen of lentils (
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
) that, similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
, has a hemibiotrophic lifestyle (

). Previously, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Colletotrichum
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
were employed for biotransformation of diverse compounds to identify potential synthetic and industrial applications of these reactions. In a few specific examples 
<tp:taxon-name>
Colletotrichum
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
, as for example, 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
, were shown to detoxify phytoalexins of alfalfa (
<tp:taxon-name>
Medicago sativa
</tp:taxon-name>
) using hydroxylation or demethylation reactions (

).
</p>
         <p>
Here we describe work uncovering the transformations of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) mediated by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Colletotrichum
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
and its detoxification by conjugation with L-cysteine (L-Cys) followed by acetylation and oxidative cyclization. Remarkably, although conjugation with L-Cys is a detoxification of xenobiotics common in animals and plants, to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of detoxification of a phytoalexin by conjugation with L-Cys.

2.1. Biotransformation of rapalexin 
A
(1) and structure elucidation of

metabolites
</title>
         <p>
First, to choose the concentration of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) to use in biotransformation experiments, its inhibitory activity against 

<tp:taxon-name>C. higginsianum</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>C. dematium</tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. lentis
</tp:taxon-name>
was determined as described in the experimental. Results of these bioassays indicated that rapalexin 
A
(
1
, 0.50–0.050 mM) is a mycelial growth inhibitor of the three 
<tp:taxon-name>
Colletotrichum
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, causing complete mycelial growth inhibition at 0.25 mM. Next, to establish potential biotransformation pathway(s) of rapalexin 
A
(
1
), mycelial cultures of each fungal species were incubated with rapalexin 
A
(
1
) in a chemically defined media (MM); samples were withdrawn from cultures immediately after addition of 
1
(0.050 mM at zero hours) and then up to 96 h. Culture samples were either frozen or immediately subjected to neutral, acidic and basic extractions (EtOAc) to obtain more complete and consistent metabolite profiles, as detailed in the experimental, and the concentrated extracts were analyzed by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS. Samples of MM incubated with 
1
(control solutions) were extracted and analyzed similarly to determine its chemical stability and recovery. Similarly, samples of cultures of each species in MM were extracted and analyzed to evaluate metabolite production in the absence of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) (control cultures).
</p>
         <p>
The 
HPLC-DAD
chromatograms of extracts of cultures of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
incubated with rapalexin 
A
indicated a decrease in rapalexin 
A
(
1
) concentration up to 48 h, while no variation of concentration in cultures of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. lentis
</tp:taxon-name>
was observed. Importantly, however, it was observed that only the 
<tp:taxon-name>HPLC</tp:taxon-name>
chromatograms of extracts of acidified cultures displayed a few small peaks that were not present in the chromatograms of acidified control cultures (i.e. all chromatograms of neutral extracts incubated with 
1
were similar to those of control cultures). These results suggested that rapalexin 
A
(
1
) was transformed by 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
to acidic metabolites and that 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. lentis
</tp:taxon-name>
did not metabolize rapalexin 
A
(
1
). The fairly fast transformation of 
1
and the low intensity of the peaks observed in all chromatograms suggested that the transformation products were not soluble in the extraction solvent (EtOAc). Hence, recover these products from the fungal cultures, incubation experiments were carried out in water, as described in the Experimental Section 4.3. In brief, 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
were first grown in MM and the mycelial mats were washed and incubated with rapalexin 
A
(
1
) in water; culture samples were collected immediately and then every 12 h, subjected to freeze-drying and the residue was analyzed by 
HPLC-DAD
(
Fig. S1
) and TIC-MS (
Fig. S2
). Control cultures of mycelia in water were prepared and analyzed similarly.
</p>
         <p>
The HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS chromatograms of cultures incubated with rapalexin 
A
(
1
) displayed two peaks, not detected in the chromatograms of control cultures, with t 

R

= 3.4 min (
9
) (
m/z

) and 
tR
= 7.1 min (

m/z

) and UV spectra different from that of rapalexin 
A
(
1
, 
m/z
203.0, [M-1] 
-
) (
Fig. S2
). After 12 h of incubation the concentration of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) decreased to less than 50% in cultures of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
(t 
1/2
= 4 h) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
(t 
1/ 2
= 8 h); 
1
was not detected in any of the cultures after 48 h. The component with 
tR
= 7.1 min (
5
) appeared to be the major product of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) metabolism in cultures of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
, whereas the component with 
tR
= 3.4 min (
9
) appeared to be the major product in cultures of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
. To obtain sufficient amounts for spectroscopic characterization and structure elucidation of these unknown components (
5
and 
9
), larger scale cultures were carried out as detailed in the Experimental Section 4.4. Eventually, the component with 
tR
= 7.1 min (
5
) was obtained from cultures of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
while the component with 
tR

in water were incubated with rapalexin 
A
(

tR
= 7.1 min (
1.1 mg
). Consistent with the HPLC-MS chromatograms, the HRMS-ESI spectrum of this compound (
5

m/z

(ten degrees of unsaturation) that implied an addition of a C

1
H
NMR spectrum (
Table 1

J
= 8.0 Hz; 7.07 d, 
J
= 8.0 Hz; 6.70, d, 
J
= 8.0 Hz) together with the HMQC spectrum indicated that the proton at C-2 of the indole ring was absent. In addition, a spin system of three protons (
δH
3.70, dd, 
J
= 13.5, 3.8 Hz; 3.51 dd, 
J
= 13.5, 7.5 Hz; 4.55, dd, 7.5, 3.8 Hz) suggesting a – 
CH
– 
CH

- unit with diastereomeric protons (HMQC, 
δC
56.7,

CH

), plus two methyl groups at 
δH
4.00 (
δC
56.0) and 1.89 (
δC
22.8) accounted for a total of 12 protons. The 
13
C NMR spectrum (
Table 1
) displayed the expected 15 carbon resonances, with two low field signals consistent with carbonyl carbons (
δC
176.3 and 173.0), plus five signals due to quaternary sp 
2
carbons. The HMBC spectrum of this compound (
tR
= 7.1 min) showed a correlation of the methyl protons at 
δH
1.89 with a low field carbon at 
δC
173.0 ppm, suggesting that this methyl was part of an acetyl group, whereas, the diastereotopic proton at 
δH
3.51 showed a correlation to the carbon at 
δC
154.6 ppm (
Fig. 3
). Considering that this molecule had an index of hydrogen deficiency of ten and that the indole ring together with two carbonyl groups accounted for eight unsaturations, two additional unsaturations were assigned to an unsaturated heterocyclic ring. Reasoning that the C 
5
H
6
NO 
3
S unit added to rapalexin 
A
(

) resulted from addition of 
N
- acetyl-L-cysteine (
N
-Ac-Cys) (C 
5
H
9
NO 
3
S) followed by oxidative cyclization, the additional unsaturated ring was assigned as a 1,3-thiazole, and the complete structure of the compound with 
tR
= 7.1 min was assigned as 
N
-acetyl- 
S
-(8-methoxy-4H-thiazolo[5,4-b]indol-2-yl)-cysteine (
5
). This structure including the absolute configuration of C-11 (
R-
), was confirmed unambiguously by synthesis, as summarized below and described in the experimental section.

S
-(2-benzothiazolyl)-Lcysteine (
7

).
</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>
Reasoning that compound 
5
(
tR
= 7.1 min) resulted from bioconjugation of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) with 
N
-acetyl-L-cysteine (
N
-Ac-Cys), a biomimetic synthesis was explored. Initially, attempts to couple rapalexin 
A
(
1
) with 
N
-Ac-L-Cys under various conditions resulted in the recovery of both compounds, with no evidence of adduct formation. Presuming that the failure to obtain the adduct was caused by the low reactivity of the ITC carbon of 
1
(due to the electron-donating effect of the indole ring), 
N
-Boc rapalexin 
A
was used. Under basic conditions, 
N
- Boc rapalexin 
A
reacted with 
N
-Ac-L-Cys to yield adduct 

8
in

good yield (
Fig. 4
). Oxidative cyclization of 
8
to 
<tp:taxon-name>form the</tp:taxon-name>
thiazole ring was first attempted following a procedure similar to that reported for cyclobrassinin (using pyridinium bromide perbromide, 

), but only traces of the thiazole product were detected among several other products. However, cyclization using 
N
-bromosuccinimide yielded the thiazole product that after deprotection yielded the desired product

in

20% overall yield. The

H
and

C NMR spectroscopic data and the 
<tp:taxon-name>HPLC</tp:taxon-name>
tR
and UV spectrum of this synthetic sample were identical to those of the isolated compound (
tR
= 7.1 min); as well, the [α] 
D
value of the synthetic sample 
5
was similar to that of the isolated compound. These data confirmed the chemical structure and absolute configuration of the metabolite with 
tR
= 7.1 min as 
N
- 
acetyl-S
-(8-methoxy-4H-thiazolo[5,4-b]indol-2-yl)-L-cysteine (
5
). To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the synthesis of this novel heterocyclic ring.

incubated with rapalexin 
A
(

9
from cultures of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
(where it was produced in larger amounts) was attempted. HPLC-HR-ESI-MS data of culture extracts suggested that this component resulted from conjugation of rapalexin

N
-Ac-Cys and the appearance of peaks at 
tR
= 3.4 min (
9
) and 
tR
= 7.1 min (
5

A
(
1

N
-Ac-Cys and rapalexin 
A
(

(

Fig. 5
). These peaks were not detected in the absence of mycelia of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
or rapalexin 
A
(

<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
were incubated with rapalexin 
A
(
1

<tp:taxon-name>HPLC</tp:taxon-name>
to monitor the solubility and stability of the component at 
tR
= 3.4 min (
9
). Results of these analyses indicated that the component at 
tR

9

tR
= 3.4 min (
9
) (
2.5 mg
). Although during this purification a slow decomposition to rapalexin 
A
(
1
) was detected, the isolated compound was of sufficient purity to obtain the NMR spectroscopic data necessary to elucidate its structure (obtained in DMSO‑

displayed two sets of signals for several protons in a ca. 3:1 ratio; for example, two spin systems at

) was complex, displaying more than the expected 13 resonances, with two very low field signals of different intensities, consistent with thiocarbonyl carbons (
δC
197.7 and 196.7, ca. 1:3), plus two signals assigned to carbonyl carbons (
δC
170.2 and 167.4, ca. 3:1) and several aromatic signals of various intensities. Altogether, the complex NMR spectra suggested that this polar compound was a mixture of two isomers. This hypothesis was consistent with the broadness of the corresponding peak observed in the 
<tp:taxon-name>HPLC</tp:taxon-name>
chromatogram (
tR
= 3.4 min).
</p>
         <p>
By contrast, the 
1
H
NMR spectrum of this compound in D 
2
O
was somewhat simpler displaying six broad signals that integrated for nine protons (three exchangeable protons not detectable, C 
13
H
12
N 
2
O
4
S 
2
). In addition to the spin systems due to a 3,4-disubstituted indole nucleus containing a methoxy group (
δH
3.84, OCH 
3
), two broad doublets at 
δH
4.00 (1 
H
, d, 13.5 Hz) and 
δH
3.51 (1 
H
, d, 13.5 Hz) attached to a carbon at 
δC
38.9 (HMQC) were consistent with the presence of two diastereotopic methylene protons. Similarly, the 
13
C NMR spectrum obtained in D 
2
O
was simpler than that obtained in DMSO‑ 
d
6
, displaying only nine carbon resonances, with a low field carbon at 
δC
201.6 corresponding to the thiocarbonyl carbon. However, the carbonyl carbon observed in DMSO‑ 
d
6
at 
δC
170.3 was not observed in D 
2
O
but was detectable through an HMBC correlation of the methylene proton at 
δH
3.51. At this point, a close inspection of the spectra obtained in D 
2
O
indicated some decomposition during spectral acquisition. Indeed, the signals corresponding to the methylene doublets at 
δΗ
4.00 and 3.51 were reduced substantially while the aromatic signals remained intact. These results confirmed that on standing this compound decomposed to rapalexin 
A
(
1
) and undetermined products. Based on these extensive analyses of the spectroscopic data (DMSO‑ 
d
6
and D 
2
O
) and HR-ESI-MS data, the structure of the compound with 
tR
= 3.4 min is assigned as 4- hydroxy-3-(4-methoxy-1 

H

-indol-3-yl)-2-thioxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (
9
). The double signals observed in the NMR spectra are assigned to rotamers that, relative to the NMR time scale, have a slower interconversion in DMSO‑ 
d
6
than in D 
2
O
. The main inferences taken from these results are summarized in 
Fig. 6
.
</p>
         <p>
Although 4-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxy-1 

H

-indol-3-yl)-2-thioxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (
9
) (
tR
= 3.4 min) has not been reported previously, retrobiosynthetic analysis suggests it is an adduct of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) and β-mercaptopyruvic acid via intermediate 
10
(
Fig. 6
). The corresponding benzyl-2-thioxothiazolidine 
12
(4-hydroxy-3-benzyl-2- thioxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid), a metabolite of benzylisothiocyanate (
11
) in mammals (
Fig. 7
), has been prepared by coupling benzylisothiocyanate with ammonium β-mercaptopyruvate (

). Using a similar procedure, the condensation of either rapalexin 
A
(
1
) or 
t
-Boc-protected rapalexin 
A
(
1
) with β-mercaptopyruvate (commercially available as sodium salt) was attempted; in both cases only the intact starting material was recovered. The absence of condensation products was deemed to be caused by the low chemical stability of mercaptopyruvate that exists in equilibrium with a cyclic dimer, but in alkaline solution undergoes irreversible conversion to an acyclic aldol dimer (

). For this reason, a synthetic approach that did not involve β-mercaptopyruvate was searched for.
</p>
         <p>
Initially, hoping that the ethyl ester of metabolite 
9
would be more stable than the acid, its preparation was attempted following a procedure similar to that used to synthesize 2-thioxo-1,3-thiazolanes (

). Hence, the condensation of 4-methoxy-3-indoleamine (
14
), prepared 
in situ
from 4-methoxy-3-nitroindole (
13
) (

), with CS 
2
followed by addition of ethyl bromopyruvate was carried out and the reaction was monitored by 
<tp:taxon-name>HPLC</tp:taxon-name>
. After 2 h, analysis of the crude reaction mixture by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS and 
1
H
NMR spectroscopy indicated a complex mixture, but the desired product was not detected (
Fig. 8
).
</p>
         <p>
To ensure that this outcome was not due to execution of the published procedure but caused by the low stability of amine 
14
, this reaction was repeated using benzylamine (
15
) and ethyl bromopyruvate, as previously reported (

) yielding the expected product ethyl 3-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-thioxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (
17
, 74% yield, 
Fig. 9
). However, similar conditions to prepare the corresponding carboxylic acid 
12
using benzylamine (
15
) and bromopyruvic acid did not yield the desired product, instead the corresponding dehydrated product 3-benzyl-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydrothiazole-4-carboxylic acid (
16
) was obtained (45% yield). HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS analysis of the crude reaction mixture indicated that dehydration occurred mostly during purification of the product, regardless of the separation media used. For this reason, a procedure that afforded a product not requiring purification was devised by reacting near stoichiometric amounts of benzylamine (
15
), CS 
2
and bromopyruvic acid, as described in the Experimental Section 4.6.3. Similar conditions employed to react 4- methoxyindole-3-amine (
14)
(unstable and always prepared 
in situ
) with CS 
2
and bromopyruvic acid yielded a mixture that contained the desired thioxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (
9
) plus HNEt 
3
Br, as determined by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS and HRMS-ESI analyses and 
1
H
NMR spectroscopic analysis.
</p>
         <p>
The HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS chromatogram of the crude reaction mixture displayed a peak with 
tR
= 3.4 min (method 
A
) and an UV absorption spectrum identical to that of compound 
9
, whereas the HPLC-ESI-MS spectrum negative mode (
Fig. S3
) displayed ions at 
m/z
358.7, 359.8, 360.8, corresponding to dimers of HNEt 
3
Br, and at 
m/z
322.7, corresponding to compound 
9
. Fractionation of this reaction mixture yielded 
9
together with HNEt 
3
Br, in a rather low yield, that is partly attributed to the relatively lower stability of both the intermediate (4- methoxyindole-3-amine (
14)
) and the desired product 
9
.

(

-thiazolo[5,4-b]indol-2-yl)cysteine (

remained unchanged in control solutions for the duration of the experiment. However, because no metabolic products of this transformation were detected, it is likely that multiple products were formed in low concentration. Metabolite

(

employing the radial mycelial grown assay described in the experimental. The antifungal activity was measured at 0.50, 0.25, 0.010 and 0.050 mM; the results indicated that 
5
displayed significantly lower growth inhibitory activity than rapalexin 
A
(
1

A
(

3. Discussion and conclusion
</title>
         <p>
Our previous work has shown that rapalexin 
A
(
1
) displays resistance to metabolism by two host-selective crucifer pathogens (
<tp:taxon-name>
L. maculans
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. brassicicola
</tp:taxon-name>
), a necessary attribute for effective plant protection (

). To understand further this resistance to metabolism, we investigated the transformation of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) by three 
<tp:taxon-name>
Colletotrichum
species
</tp:taxon-name>
having different host-ranges, 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
, a broad host range pathogen that infects various plant families, 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsian
</tp:taxon-name>
um a crucifer pathogen and a model fungus for studying fungal pathogenicity and plant immune responses, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. 
lentis
</tp:taxon-name>
,
a host-selective pathogen of lentils. Both 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
were able to transform rapalexin 
A
(
1
) to two previously undescribed metabolites: 
N
-acetyl-S-(8-methoxy-4H-thiazolo[5,4-b] indol-2-yl)cysteine (
5
) and 4-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxy-1 

H

-indol-3-yl)-2- thioxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (
9
). These compounds possess unique structures and in particular, thiazoloindole 
5
is the first member of the previously unknow heterocyclic system 1,4-dihydro-2 

H

-thiazolo [5,4- 
b
]indole-2-thione (
6
/ 
6a
). Although the chemical structure of metabolite 
5
suggested that it could result from 
S
-conjugation of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) with 
N
-acetyl-L-Cys, our results indicate that formation of metabolites 
5
and 
9
is likely to result from 
S
-conjugation of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) with L-Cys (only experiments using L-Cys increased production of 
5
and 
9
). Furthermore, it is well-known that biological ITC– 
S
-Cys conjugates result from reactions of electrophilic ITCs with glutathione (GSH), which in general are catalyzed by glutathione transferases (GSTs) (

). Hence, integration of this knowledge with our results, leads us to propose one common intermediate and two divergent pathways for the transformation of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) by 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. 10
). In both pathways 
A
and 
B
, the thiol group of GSH adds to the electrophilic ITC carbon of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) to yield an intermediate that is successively hydrolyzed to release first L-Glu and then Gly to yield the L-Cys-conjugate 
18
. Next, in pathway 
A
, intermediate 
18
undergoes acetylation to produce the 
N
- acetyl-L-Cys metabolite 
19
that is oxidatively cyclized via potential intermediate 
19a
to yield metabolite 
5
. This oxidative cyclization to form a thiazolo-indole ring appears to be the first report of such a biological reaction (
Fig. 10
). In the parallel pathway 
B
, intermediate 
18
is first transaminated to 
10
that undergoes cyclization to yield 
9
. It is not clear if cyclization of 
10
to 
9
is enzymatic or spontaneous. Regardless, these results indicate that pathway 
A
is more efficient at getting rid of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) by detoxification, as 
9
, the product of pathway 
B
, decomposes spontaneously to yield back intact rapalexin 
A
(
1
) (
Fig. 10
).
</p>
         <p>
Overall, our metabolism experiments suggest that 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
follows mainly pathway 
A
, hence we infer that this pathogen detoxifies rapalexin 
A
(
1
) more efficiently than 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
(mainly pathway 
B
), although rapalexin 
A
is not detected in either case after 48 h. Rapalexin 
A
is produced in various 
<tp:taxon-name>
Brassica
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
and other crucifers (

), but is unlikely to be produced by most of the plant spp. that host 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
. For this reason and based on related work (reviewed in 

), it was expected that detoxification of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) by a crucifer pathogen (
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
) would be different from a generalist pathogen 

(
<tp:taxon-name>C. dematium</tp:taxon-name>

). Yet, our results demonstrate the formation of identical products, hence it is suggested that the enzymes mediating rapalexin 
A
detoxification in both 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
are house-keeping enzymes involved in the detoxification of ITCs (and perhaps other electrophilic xenobiotics). Alternatively, 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
could produce selective enzyme(s) involved in rapalexin 
A
detoxification, similar to another host-selective fungal spp. (e.g. brassinin and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. maculans
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. brassicicola
</tp:taxon-name>
). In addition, it is pertinent to point out that these results are consistent with the fact that 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
are phylogenetically close species (located in adjacent clades), whereas 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. lentis
</tp:taxon-name>
is located in a more distant clade (

).
</p>
         <p>
Numerous studies have reported the importance of ITCs from crucifer vegetables in human diets due to their anticarcinogenic activity, including induction of carcinogen-detoxifying enzymes (

; 

; 

; 

). The transformations of ITCs catalyzed by GSTs have been investigated mostly in mammals and insects (

). In mammalian systems, 
S
-conjugations of ITCs with GSH are catalyzed by GSTs and the 
S
-conjugated adducts are metabolized via the mercapturic acid pathway, i.e. 
N
-acetyl-L-Cys- 
S
-conjugates (

; 

). Similarly, GSTs were shown to be involved in the metabolism and detoxification of ITCs in insects (

; 

; 

). Importantly, three ITC-inducible GSTs were reported to be essential for full virulence of 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. brassicicola
</tp:taxon-name>
, a host-selective phytopathogen of crucifers (

). Furthermore, our bioinformatics search of the genome of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
strain IMI 349063 for GSTs indicated that none of the 35 gene sequences corresponding to GSTs (

) have high homology to the 28 GST sequences of 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. brassicicola
</tp:taxon-name>
. Hence, our results together with the low GSTs homology (&lt;80%) and the fact that 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. brassicicola
</tp:taxon-name>
is unable to metabolize the ITC rapalexin 
A
(
1
) (

), lead us to propose that the GSTs of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
have substrate ranges different from the GSTs involved in virulence traits of 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. brassicicola
</tp:taxon-name>
and that the GSTs of 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. brassicicola
</tp:taxon-name>
are likely to be substrate specific (e.g. benzyl and allyl ITC substrates).
</p>
         <p>
It is noteworthy that both 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. dematium
</tp:taxon-name>
were able to detoxify rapalexin 
A
(
1
) using a pathway common to mammals and insects (
S
-conjugation with L-Cys and glutathione). Hence, given the availability of the genome sequences of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
, this fungus could be a useful model to uncover genes involved in the detoxification pathways of ITCs and other xenobiotics. Although 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. lentis
</tp:taxon-name>
was not able to metabolize rapalexin 
A
(
1
), this is not surprising considering its narrow host range (lentils) and that lentils belong to a species phylogenetically distant from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Brassica
spp.
</tp:taxon-name>
This interpretation is consistent with our previous work showing that phytoalexin detoxifying enzymes isolated from host-selective fungi displayed a narrow substrate range, whereas a detoxifying enzyme from a broad host range species had a broader substrate range (

). Considering the strong inhibitory activity of rapalexin 
A
(
1
) against several phytopathogenic fungal species, including 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 

<tp:taxon-name>C. dematium</tp:taxon-name>
,

and resistance to metabolism by 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. maculans
</tp:taxon-name>
and 

<tp:taxon-name>A. brassicicola</tp:taxon-name>
,

increasing its production in specific crucifer crops could increase resistance to some fungal pathogens. In this context, it would be valuable to establish the role of the GSTs of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. higginsianum
</tp:taxon-name>
in causing virulence in crucifer species, similar to work carried out with 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. brassicicola
(
Calmes et al., 2015
)
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>Finally, it appears appropriate to emphasize that the investigation of phytoalexin detoxification reactions can assist in understanding the interactions of plants with their pathogens and lead the development of associated disease protection strategies.</p>
