; 

), antimalarial (

), antifouling (

, 

), antimicrobial (

; 

), antifungal (

), and anthelmintic activities (

). Interestingly, the members of nitrogenous diterpenes, kalihinane diterpenoids were mainly isolated from the

Acanthella
</tp:taxon-name>
genus, such as Kalihinol A, first example reported in 1984 from Apra Harbor 
Guam
(

, 

; 

). Since the later, a number of derivatives have been isolated from the genus (

; 

, 

). These kalihinane diterpenoids composed of 
cis-
or 
trans-
decalin mother nuclei with either tetrahydropyran or tetrahydrofuran ring and substituted with nitrogenous residues.

In our previous study, we had reported the isolation of seven unreported diterpenes kalihioxepanes A-G from the sponge 
<tp:taxon-name>
Acanthella cavernosa
Dendy (Dictyonellidae)
</tp:taxon-name>
collected in 2012 (

). In the further course of our project on discovering bioactive compounds from the marine sponges of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Acanthella
</tp:taxon-name>
, eight unreported 
α
-acyloxy amide substituted kalihinane diterpenes, named kalihiacyloxyamides A-H (

         <p>
Kalihiacyloxyamide A (

) was isolated as a colorless bulk crystal (MeOH). A molecular formula of C 
25
H 
41
ClN

was established by the

[M + H] 
+
ion peak at 
m/z
469.2817 in
the HRESIMS and supported by NMR data (
Tables 1
and 
3
), indicating six degrees of unsaturation. The ESIMS of 
1
showed a cluster of isotopic [M +H] 
+
ion peaks at 
m/z
469 and 
471 in
a ratio of 3:1, revealed the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule. The 
1
H NMR spectrum in CDCl 
3
showed the presence of seven methyl [
δ
H
1.19 (3H, s), 1.33 (3H, s), 1.35 (6H, s), 1.41 (3H, s), and 1.42 (6H, s)], an isonitrile-bearing methine [
δ
H
4.57 (1H, brs)] and a chlorine-bearing methine [
δ
H
3.76 (1H, dd, 
J
=12 Hz, 4.8 Hz)]. The 
13
C NMR spectra of 
1
displayed 25 carbon resonances for one amide carbon (
δ
C
175.5), one isonitrile (
δ
C
156.7) (

; 

), seven methyls, six methylenes, five methines, and five non-protonated carbons accounted for three unsaturation. In particular, the 1D NMR spectra of 

1
in

CDCl 
3
contained resonances for a chlorine-bearing tertiary carbon (
δ
H
3.76/ 
δ
C
64.5, C-14), an isonitrile-bearing tertiary carbon (
δ
H
4.57/ 
δ
C
64.3, C-5), an amide-bearing non-protonated carbon (
δ
C
55.4, C-10), four oxygen-bearing non-protonated carbons (

δ
C
77.3, C-11; 
δ

3
-20/C-1, C-9, and C-10, H-5/C-1, C-6, and NC, and NH/C-1, C-10, and C-20 indicated the presence of a decalin moiety (
Fig. 2
). The HMBC correlations from the geminal methyls (H 
3
-16 and H 
3
-17) to C-14 and C-15, and from H 
3
-18 to C-7, C-11, and C-12, COSY correlations of H 
2
-12/H 
2
-13/H-14 and carbon resonances at 
δ
C
76.0 (C-15) and 77.3 (C-11) revealed the presence of a tetrahydropyran ring in 
1
accounted for the remaining unsaturation and connectivity of the two moieties between C-12 and C-7 through the non-protonated carbon C-11. An isobutyl amide group (Substituent a), attached to the decalin ring at C-10, was established by HMBC correlations from the geminal methyls (H 
3
-3 
′
and H 
3
-4 
′
) to C-1 
′
and C-2

and from NH [

The relative and absolute configuration of 
1
was established based on the NOESY (
Fig. 3
) and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The NOESY correlations of NH/H-1 and H-1/H-7 indicated that these protons were on the same face of the decalin ring and arbitrarily assigned 
β
-orientations. The 
α
-orientations of H-5 and H-6 was determined by the NOESY correlations of H 
3
-20/H-6 and H-6/H-5. In addition, the carbon resonances at 
δ
C
41.6 (C-1), 36.6 (C-6), 36.7 (C-9), and 18.9 (C-20) in 
1
further confirmed the 
trans
fusion of the decalin ring (

; 

; 

). Inspection of the literature data on kalihinols with a Cl-bearing pyran ring indicated that the values of carbon resonance for C-12 is characteristic for determination of the stereochemistry of Cl-14, namely owing to γ- 
gauche
effect, ~28–33 and ~37–40 for 
axial
-Cl and 
equatorial
-Cl, respectively (

; 

; 

; 

). The chlorine atom in 
1
was determined to be equatorial by the carbon chemical shifts at 
δ
C
38.3 (C-12). Finally, the absolute configuration of 
1
was unambiguously determined as 1 
S
, 4

, 5 
R
, 6 
S
, 7 
S
, 10

α
radiation (

Analysis of the 1D and 2D NMR data revealed that 
2
possessed the same carbon skeleton as 
1
(
Tables 1
and 
3
). A significant difference between 
1
and 
2
was found in the chemical shift of C-12 (
δ
C
29.1 in
2
instead of 
δ
C
38.3 in
1
), which was caused by the γ- 
gauche
effect, indicating an 
axial
orientation of Cl-14 (

; 

; 

; 

). The chemical shifts of C-1 to C-10 and NOESY correlations of NH/H-1, H-1/H-7, H 
3
-20/H-6, and H-6/H-5 indicated the relative configuration of the decalin ring in 
2
was the same as 
1
. The relative configurations of C-7 and C- 
11 in
2
were determined as 
S
* and 
R
*, respectively, from NOESY correlations of H 
3
-18/H-6, H 
3
-18/H-8b, and H-8a/H-12, as shown in the Newman projection (
Fig. 3
).
</p>
         <p>
According to literature (

), the CD spectra of kalihinols is mainly determined by the C-4 and C-5 configuration of them. Thus, the experimental ECD spectra match of 
2
with 
1
(
Fig. 5
) assign the absolute configurations of 
2
as 1 
S
, 4 
R
, 5 
R
, 6 
S
, 7 
S
, 10 
S
, 11

</p>
         <p>
The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra of 
3
and 
1
were comparable except for a marked difference in the substituent unit that 
3
has one more iso-amyl ester unit than 
1
(
Tables 1
and 
3
). The COSY correlations of H 
2
-6’/H- 7’/(H 
3
-8 
′
and H 
3
-9 
′
) and the HMBC correlations of (H-7 
′
and H 
2
-6 
′
)/C-5 
′
, C-8 
′
and C-9 
′
supported the assignment of kalihiacyloxyamide C as 
3
(
Fig. 2
). The location of the iso-amyl ester unit was assigned to be at C-2 
′
by single crystal X-ray diffraction using Cu K 
α
radiation (
Fig. 4
), and the absolute structure of kalihiacyloxyamide C (
3
) was unambiguously determined to be 1 
S
, 4 
R
, 5 
R
, 6 
S
, 7 
S
, 10 
S
, 11 
R
, and 14 
S
.
</p>
         <p>
The carbon skeleton of kalihiacyloxyamide D (
4
) was readily assignable as the same as 
3
by HSQC, HMBC, and COSY correlations. In particular, the carbon resonances of the decalin ring in 
4
were almost superimposable on those of 
3
(
Table 3
), suggesting the same stereostructure of the decalin ring for both 
3
and 
4
. Differences were observed the signals of C-12 for which the carbon resonance at 
δ
C
38.3 (C-12) in 
3
compared to 
δ
C
29.0 in 
4
, and indicating an 
axial
orientation of Cl-14 (

; 

; 

; 

). The relative configurations of C-7 and C- 
11 in
4
were determined as 
S
* and 
R
*, respectively, from NOESY correlations of H 
3
-18/H-6, H 
3
-18/H-8b, and H-8a/H-12 (
Fig. 4
). Finally, the absolute configuration of 
4
was determined as 1 
S
, 4 
R
, 5 
R
, 6 
S
, 7 
S
, 10 
S
, 11 
R
, and 14 
R
by comparison with the same experimental ECD spectra of 
1
, 
3
(
Fig. 5
) (

).
</p>
         <p>
The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR data of compounds 
5
and 
6
were similar to compounds 
3
and 
4
(
Tables 1–3
), respectively, suggested they were structural analogs, in which an iso-amyl ester group in 
3
and 
4
was replaced by a phenethyl ester group in 
5
and 
6
. The phenethyl ester group was determined by a COSY correlation of H-8’/H-9’/H-10 
′
and HMBC correlations of H 
2
-6’/C-5 
′
, C-7 
′
, and C-8 
′
, H-9’/C-7 
′
and H-10’/C- 8’ (
Fig. 2
). The relative configurations of 
5
and 
6
were established by observation of NOESY correlations of NH/H-1, H-1/H-7, H 
3
-20/H-6, H- 6/H-5, H 
3
-18/H-6, H 
3
-18/H-8b, and H-8a/H-12 (
Fig. 3
) and the carbon chemical shifts at 
δ
C
38.3 (C-12) in 
5
and 29.1 (C-12) in 
6
which were found to be the same with 
3
and 
4
(

; 

; 

; 

). The absolute configuration of 
5
and 
6
was determined as 1
