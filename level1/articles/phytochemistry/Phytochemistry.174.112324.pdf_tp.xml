ent
-junceic acid. Their structures were determined by a combination of MS, NMR spectroscopy, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. The anti-virulence activity of the isolated compounds against 
<tp:taxon-name>

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Liverworts are the ancestors of all land plants and are rich sources of mono-, sesqui- and diterpenoids and aromatic compounds, many of which exhibit noteworthy biological activities, such as allergic contact dermatitis inhibitory activity, cytotoxicity, antimicrobial and antifungal activity, insect antifeedant activity, and antioxidative properties (

; 

,b; 

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Heteroscyphus
</tp:taxon-name>
is a widespread genus (

; Blackstock and 

; 

), members of which harbour many 
types
of chemical constituents. Previous chemical investigations identified the constituents of the liverwort 
<tp:taxon-name>
Heteroscyphus coalitus
(Hook.) Schiffner (Geocalycaceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
, including clerodane, 3,4- secohalimane and halimane 
type
diterpenoids (

); aromadendrane, germacrane, calamenane, and guaiane 
type
sesquiterpenoids (

, 

; 

); and a dihydroisocoumarin derivative (

). In addition, a number of compounds, including 
ent
-spiroclerodane, clerodane diterpenoids; cadinane 
type
sesquiterpenoids; and macrocyclic bisbibenzyls (

, 

; 

) have been obtained from the liverwort 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. planus
</tp:taxon-name>
, a member of the same genus.
</p>
         <p>
The results of our previous studies on natural products with antifungal activities showed that many terpenes isolated from Chinese liverworts were active against efflux pump-deficient 
<tp:taxon-name>
Candida albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
strains (

), as potential efflux pump substrates (PEPSs) (

). Moreover, targeting 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
virulence factors, including those involved in filamentation, adhesion, and biofilm formation, is an alternative means of curing fungal infections (

; 

). The chemical investigation of Chinese liverwort 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. coalitus
</tp:taxon-name>
, collected in Wuyan Ling National Nature Reserve, 
Zhejiang Province
, 
China
, led to the discovery of 15 bioactive terpenoids, including 14 previously undescribed terpenoids (
1–14
), the isolation, structural elucidation and anti-virulence activity evaluation of which are described in this study.

possessed a harziane tetracyclic diterpene skeleton (

), which was reported as a unique diterpene isolated from

(

). Thus, this was the first time that a harziane tetracyclic diterpene has been separated from plants, especially from liverworts. The NOE experimental results (

) showed correlations of both H-5 and H-12 
α
to H-14, suggesting that these protons were co-facial and regarded as

β
orientation of H-10 was supported by the correlation from H-10 to H-12

H NMR data (

H
0.94 (s), 1.11 (d,

comparison of the 1D NMR data (

(

, except for the absence of the hydroxy group at C- 
15 in
3
and the existence of a methoxy group in 
4
. Slight variation in the chemical shifts at C-3, C-4, C-10, and –OMe and the NOE correlations of H-10/H-6

demonstrated that 
4
consisted of two C-15 epimers. The mixture 
5
was also determined to be a pair of C-15 epimers, and the only difference between 
4
and 
5
was that the methoxy group in 
4
was replaced by an ethoxy group in 
5
. Therefore 
5
was named as heteroscyphsic acid E. Here, the deduction of the absolute configuration of mixture 
4
was used as an example. We adopted ECD calculation method to calculate these two epimers and mixed them at a 1:1 ratio to get the ECD spectrum of the mixture, which was compared with the experimental one (

), and the results were shown in 
Fig. 5
. HPLC analysis was used to support that 
4
and 
5
were produced by

         <p>
Heteroscyphsic acid F (
6
) was given the same molecular formula as 
3
based on the NMR and HRESIMS data. The 1D NMR results (
Tables 2
and 
5
) exhibited similar chemical shifts to those presented in compound 
3
. The typical downfield shift of C-13 (
δ
C

169.7), as well as the upfield shift of C-14 (
δC
117.3), proved that there was a 16-hydroxy-but-13-en-15,16-olide moiety in 
6
, thus differing in this respect from 
2–5
. The differences in chemical shifts were relevant to the electron shielding effect of the conjugated carbonyl group on the 
β
-carbon (

). The relative configuration of the decalin moiety was established by NOESY correlations from both H 
3
-19 and H 
3
-17 to H-7 
β
; H-10 to H-11 
α
, and H-11 
β
, which were similar to those of

2
. The 1D NMR spectra of 
8
closely resembled those of 15-hydroxycleroda-3, (13

). The – 
C

CH

OH moiety linked to C-12 was supported by the HMBC correlations from the H-16 (

δ
C

33.6), C-13 (
δ
C

139.8), C-14 (

supported the presence of an 
E
-double bond between C-13 and C-14, and the 
1
H–

H correlations observed from the NOESY spectrum confirmed the relative configuration of 
8
, which was the same as that of 
2
. The observed experimental ECD spectrum (Fig.

8
was a congener of 
2
but an enantiomer of 15-hydroxycleroda-3, (13

was named as (13

Heteroscyphsic acid I (

. The HMBC spectrum displayed a cross-peak caused by a methyl (
δ
H

E
-double bond between C-13 and C-14 and the relative configuration of 
9
were considered to be identical to that of the above compounds according to the NOE results, and their experimental ECD curves were extremely similar. Therefore, the structure of

Heteroscyphin

Figs. 2

H–

H COSY spectra (
Fig. 2
), compound 
10
was deduced to be a labdane diterpene that was closely related to a known labda-7,12 
Z
,14-triene (

) except for the presence of a carbonyl group at C-6 (
δ
C

205.6) and a carboxyl group at C-19 (
δ
C

176.3), which was supported by the HMBC correlations from H-5 to C-6 and from both H 
2
-3 and H 
3
-18 to C-19, respectively. The molecular formula also proved the existence of the carboxyl group. NOE correlations (
Fig. 3
) from H-5 to H 
3
-18, H-1 
α
, and H-3 
α
, and from H-9 to H-1 
α
indicated that these protons were co-facial and 
α
-oriented. The 
β
-orientation of H 
3
-20 was determined by the correlation between H 
3
-20 and H-3 
β
. Moreover, the NOE experiments suggested that the sp 
2
carbon (Δ 
12
) was 
E
-configuration due to the correlations of H 
3
-16 with 
trans-
H-15b (

in the IR spectrum was attributed to a hydroxy group. The 1D NMR (
Tables 4

resembled that of compound

, except that the carboxyl group in

was reduced twice to become a –

were highly similar to those of 
10
, except that the double bond between C-7 (
δ
C

12
(Fig.

13
was identified as an analogue of

according to the 1D NMR data (

closely resembled those of

Since hypha have long been considered to be a major factor affecting fungal virulence, we investigated the effect of all undescribed compounds on the hyphal growth of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
wild-type strain SC5314 and the efflux pump deficient strain DSY 
654 in
vitro by microphotography, with fluconazole (FLC) used as a positive control (

) (
Table S1
). Compound 
13
could restrict the formation of hyphae by 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
DSY
</tp:taxon-name>
654 within 6 h at the low concentration of 4 
μ
g/ml (
Fig. 6A
) but showed no activity against SC5314. Thus, compound 
13
was selected for further investigation of its inhibitory effect toward virulence factors. Furthermore, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of undescribed compounds with an 80% reduction (MIC 
80
) were also evaluated (

During the process of

2.5. qPCR results
</title>
         <p>
To uncover the underlying molecular basis for the inhibited hyphal growth and cell adhesion caused by compound

, a qPCR analysis was performed to assess the transcription levels of genes associated with hyphal growth and cell adhesion in 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
when treated with compound 
13
. The mRNA levels of selected genes were examined, namely,

TEC1
, 
NRG1
, 
UME6
, 
ALS3
,

ECE1
. As indicated in 
Fig. 6F
, the transcriptional levels of three genes encoding adhesins, namely, 
ALS3
, 
HWP1
, and 
ECE1
, were decreased after 6 h in cells treated with 
13
. Furthermore, the expression of genes associated with the 
<tp:taxon-name>Ras</tp:taxon-name>
1-cAMP-Efg1 pathway was altered to varying extents. 
PDE2
, encoding phosphodiesterase, was upregulated in the presence of 
13
, which suggested a decrease in the intracellular cAMP content, and this abnormal change in the cAMP level would block this pathway, and impair the virulence consequently. In addition, the expression of two important transcriptional factors, Nrg1 and Ume6, was observed to dramatically change when cells were treated with 
13
. Several lines of evidence have confirmed that the expression of most hyphal-specific genes depended on 
UME6
expression, and Nrg1p and Ume6p act in a negative feedback loop to control gene expression during hyphal elongation. Thus, the upregulation of 
NRG1
and the downregulation of 
UME6
both contribute to the inhibition of mycelial growth. These results suggest that compound 
13
affected the 
<tp:taxon-name>Ras</tp:taxon-name>
1-cAMP-Efg1 pathway, 
NRG1
and 
UME6
to retard the yeast-to-hyphae transition.

3. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
In this study, fourteen previously undescribed compounds were isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. coalitus
</tp:taxon-name>
, including a rare harziane diterpene, eight 
ent
- clerodane-type diterpenoid acids, four labdane diterpenoids, and one guaiane sesquiterpene, as well as one known 
ent
-clerodane diterpenoid. Clerodane diterpenoids and guaiane sesquiterpenoids are common terpenoids of 
<tp:taxon-name>
H. coalitus
</tp:taxon-name>
according to the references (

, 

; 

; 

), but the harziane and labdane diterpenoids are isolated from this species for the first time. Compounds 
1–14
were evaluated for anti-virulence activities against 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
SC
</tp:taxon-name>
5314 and 
DSY
654, and nine compounds exhibited anti-filamentous activity against 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
DSY
</tp:taxon-name>
654 to various degrees but were ineffective against 
SC
5314. The different sensitivities of these nine compounds to the two strains resulted from their inability to be intracellularly retained in the wild-type strain due to their efflux by efflux pumps. Further investigations of heteroscyphin D (
13
) demonstrated that it possessed superior ability to inhibit the hyphal and biofilm formation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
DSY
</tp:taxon-name>
654. In addition, the adhesion ability of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
DSY
</tp:taxon-name>
654 toward biological substrates was also restrained by heteroscyphin D (
13
), suggesting its potential antifungal activity in vivo. Many natural products have been reported to display activity against 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
from previous studies (

; 

; 

), and the inhibition of virulence factors could reduce the ability of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
to cause infection. Thus, the identification of terpenoids with potential anti-virulence activity could enrich the drug library for developing novel leads against 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. albicans
</tp:taxon-name>
infection.
