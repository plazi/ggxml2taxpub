The results of the first investigation on secondary metabolites occurring in intact and damaged fruiting bodies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Russula nobilis
</tp:taxon-name>
growing in Europe, are reported. Intact mushrooms contain fatty acid esters of velutinal, while three new sesquiterpenoids, russulanobilines A‚ÄìC, along with eight known ones were isolated from extracts of injured fruiting bodies. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectral data, molecular modeling, and 
13
C 
NMR
spectra calculation. This pattern of sesquiterpenes constitutes a new variant of a chemical defense machinery which protects mushrooms against predators, parasites, and microorganisms.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
About 750 species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Russula
</tp:taxon-name>
mushrooms are reported to grow worldwide under different trees, with which they 
<tp:taxon-name>form ecologically</tp:taxon-name>
important ectomycorrhizae (

). These fungi share several morphological features with the species 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lactarius
</tp:taxon-name>
, with which they 
<tp:taxon-name>form the</tp:taxon-name>
family of 
<tp:taxon-name>Russulaceae</tp:taxon-name>
. However, in contrast to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lactarius
</tp:taxon-name>
fruiting bodies which exude a latex-like milk when they are bruised, the lactiferous hyphal system, present also in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Russula
</tp:taxon-name>
mushrooms, has become inactive during the evolution of these species and hence no latex is produced. Depending on the species, the flesh of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Russula
</tp:taxon-name>
mushrooms has a permanent mild taste or a taste changing from mild to acrid‚Äìbitter, in the course of a few seconds to minutes, thus providing important information about each species taxonomy and edibility.
</p>
         <p>
Sesquiterpenes of different 
types
are the most characteristic secondary metabolites occurring in 
<tp:taxon-name>Russulaceae</tp:taxon-name>
(

; 

; 

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lactarius
</tp:taxon-name>
sesquiterpenoids show a higher variety of structures, although this finding may depend on the less number of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Russula
species
</tp:taxon-name>
investigated so far. In fact, with the notable exemptions
</p>
         <p>
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. lepida
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. amarissima
(
Clericuzio et al., 2012
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, producing aristolane and nardosinane sesquiterpenes, all the other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Russula
species
</tp:taxon-name>
investigated so far afforded only sesquiterpenes of the protoilludane‚Äìmarasmane‚Äìlactarane cascade (

; 

; 

). These are, indeed, the most common sesquiterpenes also isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lactarius
</tp:taxon-name>
. Intact cells of most 
<tp:taxon-name>Russulaceae</tp:taxon-name>
contain biologically inactive and tasteless fatty acid esters of a single sesquiterpene alcohol (

; 

; 

). However, when tissues are damaged, these precursors are enzymatically transformed, in a time varying from seconds to hours, into a variety of ‚Äò‚Äòsecond generation‚Äô‚Äô metabolites, which may be either tasteless or bitter‚Äìacrid, depending on the structures. It has been suggested that this rather intriguing biochemical machinery, giving rise to different patterns of bitter‚Äìpungent sesquiterpenes in injured fruiting bodies (

; 

; 

), forms a chemical defense system, which protects the fruiting bodies of 
<tp:taxon-name>Russulaceae</tp:taxon-name>
against parasites, microorganisms, and predators (

In continuation of our multi-year investigation on the chemical constituents of wild European 
<tp:taxon-name>Russulaceae</tp:taxon-name>
, herein we report our findings on sesquiterpenes isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Russula nobilis
Velen.
</tp:taxon-name>
(syn. 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. mairei
Singer
</tp:taxon-name>
), for which no phytochemical data exist in the literature. This mushroom grows in northern 
Italy
in late summer‚Äìautumn in mixed conifer and broad-leaved woods, in particular under beeches. It is considered inedible for the strongly acrid‚Äìpeppery taste which develops rapidly on the tongue and the severe gastrointestinal disorders caused by ingestion of raw fruiting bodies.

A complete phytochemical investigation of any 
<tp:taxon-name>Russulaceae</tp:taxon-name>
species requires the analysis of secondary metabolites occurring in intact as well as in damaged fruiting bodies since, as we have repeatedly stressed in previous papers, dramatic differences very often exist between the two contents (

; 

; 

). To this purpose, extraction of a few or even one fresh intact fruiting body usually affords enough material for compound identification by NMR or HPLC analysis. However, protic solvents, such as EtOH or MeOH, must cautiously be excluded for extraction, to avoid the formation of artefacts by degradation of original metabolites (

; 

; 

). Therefore, the soundness of results on metabolites isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lactarius
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Russula
</tp:taxon-name>
fruiting bodies extracted with alcoholic solvents have to be considered with suspicion. Indeed, it appears that, even recently, some authors do not pay enough attention to this critical issue of the mushroom chemistry.

In this study, one intact specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. nobilis
</tp:taxon-name>
was soaked in 
CH
2
Cl 
2
at RT. After about 10 min, the solution was removed by decantation, rapidly dried with Na 
2
SO 
4
, and evaporated to dryness 
in vacuo
. The 
1
H NMR spectrum of the residue clearly indicated the predominant presence of velutinal stearate 
1
(

), accompanied by other unsaturated fatty acid esters. Exposure of the residue to 1 mM NaOEt in EtOH at RT afforded free (+)-velutinal 
2
(

) and a mixture of fatty acid ethyl esters. They were determined, by GC‚ÄìMS analysis, as ethyl stearate (73%), oleate (9.5%), linoleate (7.5%), palmitate (7%), and other (&lt;1% each) unidentified ethyl esters.

2.2. Sesquiterpenes in damaged fruiting bodies of 
<tp:taxon-name>R. nobilis</tp:taxon-name>
         </tp:mixed-nomenclature>
         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="description">
            <p>
To study the complex patterns of secondary metabolites enzymatically formed in injured fruiting bodies, freshly collected undamaged specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. nobilis
</tp:taxon-name>
were finely ground at RT without adding any solvent, then left at RT in the air; subsequently, samples of the mush were extracted with 
CH
2
Cl 
2
at different times after injury and extracts were analyzed by TLC. Following this procedure, we observed a continuous change in the patterns of metabolites extracted in the first 30 min. Thus, to identify the compound(s) responsible for the pungency of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. nobilis
</tp:taxon-name>
to the human tongue, extraction of the mush had to be done within 30 s after crushing fruiting bodies. Separation of the extract on a RP-18 column afforded the antimicrobial dialdehyde (
‚Äî
)-velleral 
3
, followed by unchanged velutinal esters. Velleral 
3
is one of the acrid sesquiterpene dialdehydes responsible for the pungency of several 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lactarius
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Russula
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, being formed by enzymatic conversion of velutinal esters, such as the stearate (+) 
‚Äî
1
(
Sterner et al., 1985
; 
Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
). Notably, velleral 
3
was rapidly metabolized in damaged specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. nobilis
</tp:taxon-name>
, being almost undetectable in an extract made 1 min after injury, whereas a significant amount of stearate 
1
was still present. On the other hand, a TLC of an extract of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. nobilis
</tp:taxon-name>
made 20 min after mincing fruiting bodies indicated the absence of dialdehyde 
3
as well as stearate 
1
; in their place, different more polar compounds were detected as intensely colored red‚Äìblue‚Äìgreen spots by staining silica gel plates with the sulphovanillin reagent. The extract was then partitioned between hexane and MeOH‚ÄìH 
2
O (9:1), and the components of the polar layer were subsequently separated by multiple chromatographic separations on silica gel and RP-18 columns, to give several oxygenated sesquiterpenes, namely: the known furanolactaranes furandiols (+)

(
Nozoe et al., 1971

Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
) and (+) 
‚Äî

(
Daniewski et al., 1993

Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
), conjugated anhydrolactarorufin A

Daniewski et al., 1984
; 
Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
), and lactarorufin A (+) 
‚Äî

(
Daniewski and Kocor, 1971

Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
); the 8,9-seco-5-lactaranolides blennin C 

(

(
Vidari et al., 1976

(
Pang et al., 1992
; 
Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
); three new lactarane sesquiterpenoids, 
12‚Äì14
, named russulanobilines A‚ÄìC.
</p>
            <p>
NMR data indicated the structure of conjugated anhydrolactarorufin A for compound 
7a
, which was reported to occur in several 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lactarius
</tp:taxon-name>
species (
Daniewski et al., 1984
; 
Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
); however, no physical or spectral data of an isolated sample of this sesquiterpene alcohol have been published so far (
Vidari and Vita-Finzi, 1995
; 
Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
; 
Clericuzio et al., 2008
). Therefore, we report now the spectroscopic data of compound 
7a
, along with its absolute configuration. In addition to three singlets attributable to the three characteristic methyl groups of the lactarane skeleton, one of which was located on a double bond (

Œ¥H

1.93, Me-12), the 
1
H NMR spectrum showed these characteristic resonances for structure 
7a
: an isolated olefinic proton at 

Œ¥H

5.93 assigned to H-4, an AB system collapsed at 

Œ¥H

4.85 attributable to H 
2
-13, one proton doublet (
J
= 10.8 Hz) at 

Œ¥H

4.44 assignable to H-8, 
trans
to H-9, two multiplets at 
Œ¥H
2.78 and at 

Œ¥H

2.30 attributed to H-2 and H-9, respectively; a triplet (
J
= 12.5 Hz) at 

Œ¥H

1.44 along with a coupled double-doublet (
J
= 12.5 and 6.2 Hz) at 

Œ¥H

2.02, assigned to H 
2
-1; a double-doublet (
J
= 14.0 and 7.2 Hz) at 

Œ¥H

1.73, along with a coupled double-doublet (
J
= 14.0 and 2.2 Hz) at 

Œ¥H

1.88, assignable to H 
2
-10. The 
13
C NMR spectrum (
Table 1
) was fully consistent with structure 
7a
. Moreover 
7a
was converted by standard acetylation conditions to 
7b
, which was identical, including the optical rotation, with the dehydration product of the very well-known (+)-lactarorufin A - 
8
(
Daniewski and Kocor, 1970
; 
Daniewski et al., 1976
).
</p>
            <p>
As to the new compounds 
12‚Äì14
, biogenetic considerations and the presence of three characteristic methyl signals in the NMR spectra, two of which geminal to a quaternary sp 
3
carbon (C-11) and the third one bonded to a methine (C-3), clearly suggested they were lactarane derivatives (
Vidari and Vita-Finzi, 1995
; 
Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
; 
Clericuzio et al., 2008
). Moreover, a strong band at about 
1740‚Äì1770 cm
‚Äî
1

in the IR spectra and the signal for an ester carbonyl group at 

Œ¥C

170‚Äì175 ppm in the 
13
C NMR spectra indicated that all the three compounds were unsaturated ∆≥- lactones.
</p>
            <p>
The structure of russulanobiline A 
12
was derived by comparison with that of vellerolactone 
11
(
Froborg and Magnusson, 1978
; 
Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
). In fact, in analogy with compound 
11
, the 
1
H NMR spectrum of 
12
showed a collapsed AB system at 

Œ¥H

4.82 for the H 
2
-13, which was allylically coupled (
J
= 1.3 Hz) with H-8 (

Œ¥H

5.75); moreover, the 
1
H‚Äì 
1
H COSY spectrum indicated the entire proton spin system extending from H-4 to H 
2
-1 through H- 3 and H-2, with H-3 being also coupled to Me-12, as for compound 
11
. One tertiary OH group was located at the quaternary sp 
3
carbon C-9 of 
12
, which resonated at 

Œ¥C

83.3 (s). In accordance with this position of the OH group, in the 
1
H NMR spectrum of 
12
H 
2
-10 gave rise to an isolated AB system (

JAB

= 13.2 Hz) centered at 

Œ¥H

1.80; and the signal for H-8 (

Œ¥H

5.75) showed no vicinal couplings; moreover, due to the electronegativity of the vicinal OH group, H-8 was shifted downfield in comparison with the corresponding signal (

Œ¥H

5.61) of 9-deoxy-lactone 
11
(
Magnusson and Thor√©n, 1973
). In addition, in the 
1
H NMR spectrum of compound 

12
in

CD 
2
Cl 
2
, the doublet for H 
3
-12 (

Œ¥H

1.31) experienced a downfield shift of 0.19 ppm in comparison with the corresponding signal for the 9-deoxy derivative 
11
(
Magnusson and Thor√©n, 1973
), and the shift was even larger (0.33 ppm) in C 
5
D 

5
N.

Similarly, the signals for H-2 and 
Hoi-
10 of russulanobiline A 
12
experienced solvent-induced deshielding effects of 0.15 and 0.16 ppm, respectively, in C 
5
D 
5
N relative to CD 
2-
Cl 
2
. These solvent shifts (
Demarco et al., 1968
) strongly suggested the 
cis
-stereochemistry of H 
3
-12, H-2 and 9-OH. The HMBC spectrum of 
12
(

) confirmed the connectivity of carbon atoms, while the vicinal coupling constants of H-2 and H-3, and NOESY correlations (

) were fully consistent with the geometry of the calculated most stable conformer (&gt;99%) (

) of russulanobiline A 
12
.

The COSY spectrum of russulanobiline B 
13
showed four different proton spin systems, namely: (i) an isolated AB system (

JAB

= 17.4 Hz) centered at 

Œ¥H

4.91, assigned to H 
2
-5; (ii) a broad singlet at 

Œ¥H

6.12, allylically coupled (
J
ca.1 Hz) to 
HŒ≤-
10 (

Œ¥H

2.45), attributed to H-8; (iii) an extended spin system encompassing from H-4 at 

Œ¥H

4.34 to 
Hoi-
1 at 

Œ¥H

1.77 and 
HŒ≤-
1 at 

Œ¥H

1.51, through H-3 centered at 

Œ¥H

1.86 and H-2 centered at 

Œ¥H

2.83, with H-3 being also coupled to Me-12 (
J
= 7.2 Hz); iv) a broad AB system (

JAB

= 17.3 Hz) centered at 

Œ¥H

2.40, assigned to H 
2
-10. The signal of 
HŒ≤-
10 at 

Œ¥H

2.45 also showed two long range couplings (
J
ca.1 Hz) with H-8 at 

Œ¥H

6.12 and H-2 at 

Œ¥H

2.83, while 
Hoi-
10 at 

Œ¥H

2.35 also exhibited a W-type coupling with 
Hoi-
1 at 

Œ¥H

1.77. The 
13
C NMR spectrum confirmed the presence of an oxygenated methine (C-4) at 

Œ¥C

71.2, and a ∆≥- lactone carbonyl group (C-13) at 

Œ¥C

174.8, cross-conjugated with a 1,3-diene system formed by a tetrasubstituted olefin [

Œ¥C

124.4 (s, C-7) and 155.4 (s, C-6)] and a trisubstituted double bond [

Œ¥C

110.5 (d, C-8) and 160.4 (s, C-9)]. The small value of 
J
3,4
=1.8 Hz indicated that H-4 was 
cis
to H-3, while the large value of 
J
2,3
=9.5 Hz supported a 
trans
quasi-diaxial orientation of H-2 and H-3. In accordance with modeling studies (
vide infra
), in the minimum energy conformation 
13a
(

), the OH-4 and Me-3 groups were thus pseudo-axially and pseudo-equatorially oriented, respectively, on the central cycloheptadiene ring. The HMBC spectrum (

) confirmed signal assignments and structure 
13
, while the NOESY spectrum (

) supported its relative stereochemistry. In addition, a NOESY cross peak (

) between the oxygenated proton H-4 and 
HŒ≤-
5 of compound 
13
confirmed the position of the lactone methylene group at C-5 and, as a consequence, the carbonyl group at C-13.
</p>
            <p>
Inspection of the NMR spectra of russulanobiline C- 
14
clearly indicated the close structural relationship with compound 
13
; however, the majority of the 
13
C NMR resonances were splitted into two signals due to the presence of two C-5 epimers (
vide infra
). Actually, the compound contained: (i) a lactone carbonyl group (

Œ¥C
169.7s
), cross-conjugated with a 1,3-diene moiety (

Œ¥C
144.5s
/ 
144.4s
, 
135.2s
/ 
135.1s
, 112.8d/112.3d,

170.9s
) comprising the C 
6
‚ÄìC 
7
‚ÄìC 
8
‚ÄìC 
9
carbon sequence; (ii) a vinylic proton at C-8 (

Œ¥H

6.43/6.39, br s) allylically coupled to 
HŒ≤-
10 (

Œ¥H

2.56), which formed a broad AB system (

JAB

= 17.2 Hz) with 
Hoi-
10 (

Œ¥H

2.50); (iii) a proton spin system extending from H 
2
-1 to H 
3
-12 through H-2 and H- 3. Moreover, the presence, in the 
13
C 
NMR
spectrum of 
14
, of a signal (

Œ¥C

198.3s/198.1s) assignable to an unsaturated carbonyl group and the absence of signals attributable to H-4/C-4, clearly indicated the presence of a ketone at C-4. This assignment was confirmed by the 
HMBC
cross-peak correlation (

) between H 
3
-12 (

Œ¥H

1.12) and the ketone carbonyl carbon. Accordingly, compared to the corresponding signal of alcohol 
13
, proton H- 
3 in
russulanobiline C lacked the vicinal coupling constant with H-4 and it was significantly shifted downfield from 

Œ¥H

1.86 to 

Œ¥H

2.75, due to the oi- position of the carbonyl group. In addition, two singlets for an acetal proton at 

Œ¥H

6.46/ 
6.37 in
the 
1
H 
NMR
spectrum and two doublets for an acetal carbon at 

Œ¥C

97.1/97.0 in the 
13
C 
NMR
spectrum of russulanobiline C, suggested that compound 
14
contained a ∆≥ -hydroxybutenolide moiety. Thirteen pairs of peaks with similar height and chemical shift values in the 
13
C 
NMR
spectrum indicated that russulanobiline C was constituted by two epimers, 
14oi
and 
14∆•
, at the carbinol center of the ∆≥- hydroxybutenolide unit, in a ratio of ca. 1:1. The fast equilibrium between the two epimers made the chromatographic separation of the mixture impossible. 
HMBC
(

) and 
NOESY
correlations (

) supported the gross structure of russulanobiline C, including its relative stereochemistry; however, assignment of the 
NMR
resonances to each of the two anomers was impossible.
</p>
            <p>
The sole 2D 
NMR
data did not allow us to make a firm distinction between the alternative regioisomeric structures 
14oi/14∆•
and 

15oi/ 
15∆•

. Since a crystal suitable for X-ray of russulanobiline C was not available, we envisaged the possibility to distinguish the two regioisomers by comparing the experimental 
13
C 
NMR
resonances of russulanobiline C with the chemical shifts calculated for the most populated modeled conformers of 
14oi/14∆•
and 
15oi/15∆•
(
Table 1
). To confirm the validity of the method, the related lactone russulanobiline B (
13
) was also modeled and the calculated 
13
C NMR signals were compared with the experimental spectrum (
Table 1
).

            <p>
All the degrees of conformational freedom were considered for the structures 
13
, 
14oi/14∆•,
and 
15oi/15∆•
, in particular the various possible conformations of cyclopentane ring and the orientation of the methyl groups H 
3
-14 and H 
3
-15. Each structure showed two mainly populated conformations 
13a
and 
13b
, 
14oia
and 
14oib
, 
14∆•a
and 
14∆•b
, 
15oia
and 
15oib
, 
15∆•a
and 
15∆•b
(

), respectively, corresponding to two different geometries of the cyclopentane ring, characterized by the torsional angles 
∆Æ
1
(C11 
AC

AC
2 
AC
3) and 
∆Æ
2
(C11 
AC
10 
AC
9 
AC
8) (

). The conformer carrying the pseudoequatorially oriented H 
3
-14 group was largely favored for all compounds. On the other hand, the conjugated diene system conferred a high rigidity to the central seven-membered ring on which the equatorial orientation of the H 
3
-12 group was highly preferred. Subsequently, the 
13
C 
NMR
chemical shifts were calculated for the most populated conformer of each structure, namely for 
13a
, 
14oia
, 
14∆•a
, 
15oia
, and 
15∆•a
, using two-step spin‚Äìspin coupling calculation (
Deng et al., 2006
) and considering CD 
2
Cl 
2
as the solvent and TMS as the reference standard.
</p>
            <p>
The computed carbon resonances for the modeled structures are reported in 
Table 1
, compared with the experimental data of russulanobilines B and C. The good correspondence between the experimentally determined 
13
C 
NMR
resonances of russulanobiline B and the calculated chemical shifts for structure 
13
validated the method. Of particular importance was the close similarity between the experimental and computed chemical shifts of the conjugated diene system C-6/C-7/C-8/C-9. On the other hand, the comparison of the experimental resonances of the C-6/C-7/C-8/C-9 diene unit in russulanobiline C and the calculated chemical shifts of the same carbons for the regioisomeric structures 
14oi/14∆•
and 
15oi/15∆•
, clearly showed a much better correspondence with structures 

14oi/ 
14∆•

.
</p>
            <p>
In conclusion, on the basis of the modeling studies and 
13
C NMR chemical shift calculations, we confidently assigned structure 
14
, as a mixture of C-5 anomers, to russulanobiline C.

2.4. Absolute configuration of isolated sesquiterpenes
</p>
            <p>
The absolute configuration of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Russulaceae</tp:taxon-name>
sesquiterpenes derived from velutinal esters of 
type
1
is based on that of (+)-isov-elleral 
16
, which was established by an enantioselective total synthesis (
Bergman et al., 1990
). In fact, stereochemically controlled intercorrelations (
Vidari and Vita-Finzi, 1995
; 
Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
) and correlations also with (+)-isovelleral 
16
demonstrated that the marasmane and lactarane sesquiterpenes formed in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lactarius
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Russula
</tp:taxon-name>
damaged fruiting bodies belong to the same enantiomeric series as that of their biosynthetic precursor 
1
. Plausible mechanisms have also been suggested to explain the characteristic stereochemistry of different sesquiterpenes enzymatically derived from velutinal esters in injured 
<tp:taxon-name>Russulaceae</tp:taxon-name>
fruiting bodies (
De Bernardi et al., 1993
; 
Hansson et al., 1993
). The co-occurrence of new sesquiterpenes 
12‚Äì14
with stereodefined compounds 
3‚Äì10
, and their common origin from ester 

1
in

injured fruiting bodies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. nobilis
</tp:taxon-name>
, indicated the absolute configuration shown in the formulae. This homochiral stereochemistry of compounds 
1‚Äì14
was confirmed by the conversion of 5-lactar-anolide 
7a
to conjugated anhydrolactarorufin 
<tp:taxon-name>A acetate</tp:taxon-name>
(
‚Äî
) 
‚Äî
7b
, identical with the compound obtained from (+)-lactarorufin A 
8
(
Daniewski et al., 1976
). Moreover, the absolute configuration of russulanobiline B (
13
) was further supported by CD measurement. In fact, Gawronski et al. have discovered a simple CD method for assigning the absolute configuration to an allylic alcohol in a ring fused to a 2(5 
H
)-furanone ring (
Gawronski et al., 1996
). The proposed helicity rule was also demonstrated by the Cotton effects of opposite signs determined for the diastereomeric (+)-lactaroru-fin A 
8
and (
‚Äî
)-8- 
epi
-lactarorufin A (
17
) which have opposite configuration at C-8 (
Daniewski and Kocor, 1971
). Russulanobiline B (
13
), similarly to (
‚Äî
)-8- 
epi
-lactarorufin A (
17
), showed negative sign of the n 
+
œÄ 

‚ÅÑ

transition Cotton effect at 
255 nm
. Therefore, on the basis of the helicity rule for the HO‚ÄìC‚ÄìC 
@
C‚ÄìCO bond system (
Gawronski et al., 1996
), the (

R

)-configuration at C-8 of compound 
13
was confirmed, and hence its absolute stereochemistry.

3. Conclusions
</p>
            <p>
Our findings on the contents of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. nobilis
</tp:taxon-name>
confirm that there is no clear-cut chemical separation between the majority of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Russula
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lactarius
species
</tp:taxon-name>
as far as the content of sesquiterpene metabolites in undamaged fruiting bodies is concerned. In fact, intact fruiting bodies of most bitter or pungent 
<tp:taxon-name>Russulaceae</tp:taxon-name>
species contain the marasmane sesquiterpene velutinal in the form of tasteless fatty acid esters, such as 
1
(
Vidari and Vita-Finzi, 1995
; 
Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
; 
Clericuzio et al., 2008
). However, the pattern of sesquiterpenes formed upon an injury to fruiting bodies is usually dramatically different from species to species (
Vidari and Vita-Finzi, 1995
; 
Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
; 
Clericuzio et al., 2008
), and such characteristic differences are chemotaxonomically important. A further example is given by the compounds isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. nobilis
</tp:taxon-name>
, which nicely characterize this mushroom with respect to the other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Russula
species
</tp:taxon-name>
investigated so far (
Clericuzio et al., 2008
; 
Clericuzio et al., 2012
; 
Yaoita et al., 2012
; 
Gilardoni et al., 2014
). This diversity very likely reflects the existence of various enzymatic systems at work in each mushroom species, which control multi-step rearrangements of the original pentacyclic velutinal skeleton into other structures and modulate the oxidation state at specific carbon positions. Thus, lactaronobilines 
12‚Äì14
likely derive from oxidations of velleral (
‚Äî
) 
‚Äî
3
which, in damaged fruiting bodies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. nobilis
</tp:taxon-name>
, is enzymatically formed in a few seconds from velutinal esters of 
type
1
. Indeed, regiospecific oxidation of the two carbonyl groups in velleral 
3
may lead to the 
two types
of lactarane lactones found in 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. nobilis
</tp:taxon-name>
, having the carbonyl group either at C-5 (5-lactaranolides), such as in compounds 
6‚Äì12
or at C- 13 (13-lactaranolides), such as in 
13
and 
14
. Alternatively, hydroxylactones 
13
and 
14
may derive from regiospecific oxidation of furans, such as furandiol (+) 
‚Äî
5
(
Vidari and Vita-Finzi, 1995
; 
Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
; 
Clericuzio et al., 2008
).
</p>
            <p>
5-Lactaranolides are much more widespread than 13-lactaranolides in 
<tp:taxon-name>Russulaceae</tp:taxon-name>
. Actually, compounds 
13
and 
14
are the first examples of 13-lactaranolides isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Russula
</tp:taxon-name>
fruiting bodies.
</p>
            <p>
The pungent velleral 
3
and the bitter lactarorufins 
7a
and 
8
are thus responsible, at least in part, for the unpalatable taste of the fruiting bodies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. nobilis
</tp:taxon-name>
, that quickly develops on the lips and tongue of a person who, unaware of its rather peculiar chemistry, bites the flesh of this mushroom. Actually, we believe that the complex patterns of sesquiterpenes formed at different times in the fruiting bodies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. nobilis
</tp:taxon-name>
constitute a chemical defense system against microorganisms, parasites and predators (
Sterner et al., 1985
). Given the wide range of its biological activities (
Vidari and Vita-Finzi, 1995
) and its formation from tasteless ester 

1
in

a few seconds after injury to mushroom tissues, the dialdehyde velleral 
3
is likely to be the main component of the deterrence machinery in 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. nobilis
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
The existence of a chemical defense system in higher mushrooms is not an oddity. Indeed, like plants, fungi have evolved multivaried defense strategies in order to protect themselves against feeding mammals, including humans, insects, and parasites. So far, two different 
types
of chemical defense mechanisms widely occur in higher mushrooms (
Spiteller, 2008
). A group of fungi, e.g. toxic 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amanita
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, use secondary metabolites, e.g. amanitins, that are present permanently in their bioactive form in the mushrooms. Other mushrooms, like the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Russula
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lactarius
species
</tp:taxon-name>
have elaborated a binary weapon system, namely wound-induced mechanisms relying on the enzymatic conversion of inactive precursors to the active agents, which occurs only transiently upon activation by an injury. It is interesting to note that 
<tp:taxon-name>Russulaceae</tp:taxon-name>
species have evolved, as components of their ammunition systems, not only sesquiterpenes belonging to the marasmane‚Äìlactarane cascade (
Daniewski and Vidari, 1999
), like those described in this paper, but also guaiane, farnesane, drimane, caryophyllane, and other classes of terpenoids, depending on the species (
Vidari and Vita-Finzi, 1995
; 
Sterner and Anke, 1995
). Even mixed phenolic/terpenoid metabolites are present in the chemical defense machinery of a few 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lactarius
species
</tp:taxon-name>
(
De Bernardi et al., 1992
; 
Takahashi et al., 1993
). Contrary to the constitutive or wound-activated chemical defense mechanisms, so far little is known about the presence in higher mushrooms of an induced defense mechanism, that involves the activation of genes and an induction of the 
de novo
biosynthesis of defense compounds. In striking contrast, induced chemical defense is widespread in plants (
Spiteller, 2008
) and this may represent a significant metabolic advantage for living organisms and an important evolutionary marker.
