1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Medicinal mushrooms of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma
</tp:taxon-name>
have been used for many 
types
of health products. 
Lanostane
triterpenoids have been considered one of the key ingredients of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma lucidum
</tp:taxon-name>
, a popular traditional 
Chinese
medicine known as 
Lingzhi
, and related species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma lucidum
</tp:taxon-name>
complex (

). A number of lanostanes and modified lanostanes have been isolated from these species (Baby et al., 2015; 

), and a broad range of their biological activities linked to the health-improving properties of the medicinal mushroom have been reported (

). 
Recently
, we conducted artificial fruiting body cultivation of various 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma
species
</tp:taxon-name>
and their chemical investigations as a strategy for structural diversification of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma
</tp:taxon-name>
lanostanoids (

, 

, 

). 
We
report here the results of the chemical investigation of a 
Lingzhi
–like 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma
species
</tp:taxon-name>
collected in 
Northern
Thailand
, which was identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma sichuanense
J.D. Zhao &amp; X.Q. Zhang (Ganodermataceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
after performing the chemical studies. 
This
species is considered one of the members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma lucidum
</tp:taxon-name>
complex. 
Three
undescribed lanostane triterpenoids (
1–3
) (
Fig. 1
), together with twenty-one known lanostanes (
4–24
) (

Fig. 
S
1

), were isolated from the cultivated fruiting bodies. The isolated compounds were tested for antitubercular and antimalarial activities and cytotoxicity to noncancerous Vero cells. We also report here the determination of the C-25 absolute configuration of ganoderic acid A (
4
) and structurally close analogs by using the phenylglycine methyl ester (PGME) method (

).

2. Results and discussion
</title>
         <p>
The molecular formula of compound 
1
was determined by HRESIMS and 
13
C NMR as C 
33
H 
48
O 
7
. The 
1
H and 
13
C NMR, DEPT, and HSQC data for 
1
supported the presence of three ketones, a carboxyl carbon, a tetrasubstituted olefin, a ketal carbon, two oxygenated methines, four quaternary carbons, four methines, seven methylenes, and nine methyl groups (
Table 1
). The NMR data were similar to those of the well-known cometabolite ganoderic acid A (
4
) (

); however, compound 
1
additionally possessed a ketal carbon (
δ
C
102.1) and two singlet methyl groups. The lanostane C 
30
skeleton was proven to be the same as ganoderic acid A by analysis of COSY and HMBC spectra (
Fig. 2
). Thus, the locations of the three ketones at C-3, C-11, and C-23 were revealed by the HMBC correlations from H 
2
-1, H 
2
-2, H 
3
-28, and H 
3
-29 to C-3 (
δ
C
217.1), from H 
2
-12 to C-11 (
δ
C
199.6), and from H 
2
-22 and H 
2
-24 to C-23 (
δ
C
208.5), respectively. The presence of a terminal carboxylic acid was demonstrated by the HMBC correlations from 
Ha-
24, 
Hb-
24, H-25, and H 
3
-27 to the carbonyl carbon (
δ
C
180.6, C-26). The presence of an acetonide that links 7β- OH and 15α- OH of ganoderic acid A was revealed by the HMBC correlations from H-7 (
δ
H
4.58), H-15 (
δ
H
4.53), and singlet methyl protons H 
3
-1 
ʹ
(
δ
H
1.45) and H 
3
-3 
ʹ
(
δ
H
1.37) to the ketal carbon (C-2 
ʹ
). The relative configuration of compound 
1
was elucidated to be the same as ganoderic acid A on the basis of the NOESY correlations (
Fig. 3
). Correlations between H 
3
-19/ 
Hβ-
6, 
Hα-
6/H-7, and H-7/H 
3
-30 demonstrated a 
trans
AB-ring junction and an α- orientation of H-7. The relative configuration of C-13/C-14/C-15/C-17/C-20 was deduced from the NOESY correlations between H 
3
-30/ 
Hα-
12, H 
3
-30/H-17, H 
3
-18/ 
Hβ-
12, H 
3
-18/H-15, H 
3
-18/H-20, and 
Hβ-
12/H 
3
-21. NOESY correlations of H-7/H 
3
-1 
ʹ
and H-15/H 
3
-3 
ʹ
were consistent with the 
trans
relation of H-7 (α) and H-15 (β). The structure of compound 
1
was confirmed by chemical correlation to ganoderic acid A (
4
). Compound 
4
was converted to 
1
by treatment with 
p
-TsOH‧H 
2
O in 2,2-dimethoxypropane. Consequently, compound 
1
was identified as the acetonide derivative of ganoderic acid A. In the present study, the mushroom material was extracted with 
CH
2
Cl 
2
and MeOH; however, acetone was used for silica gel column chromatography (see Experimental). Therefore, the possibility that compound 
1
was an isolation artifact resulting from acetonide formation from 
4
is not ruled out.

The remaining question was the absolute configuration of C-25. Ganoderic acid A (
4
) is one of the major lanostane constituents in the medicinal mushroom Lingzhi (
<tp:taxon-name>
G. lucidum
</tp:taxon-name>
), and it is the first member of a large compound group with the trivial name. Therefore, it has been recognized as a symbolic 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma
</tp:taxon-name>
lanostanoid. The structure of the C-20–C-27 side chain, possessing a C-23 ketone and a C-26 carboxylic acid, is one of the common features in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma
</tp:taxon-name>
lanostanoids. The absolute configurations of C-25 have not been determined for most of these compounds. Since the C-25 chiral carbon is isolated from the main part of the molecule, assignment of its configuration, relative to the tetracyclic ring and C-20, by NMR techniques is difficult. Additionally, the ECD calculation method would not be suitable for determining the relative configuration, while it is very useful for confirming the absolute configuration of the lanostane skeleton. There have been a few examples of the configuration of C-25 being determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis, and both 24 
S
- and 25 
R
-isomers have been reported (

; 

; 

). It is generally difficult to obtain crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis for this group of compounds. For ganoderic acid A (
4
), most literature and web information (e.g., in catalogs as a biochemical reagent) do not show or indicate the 25 
R
configuration in the depicted chemical structure. We were unable to find literature that describes the determination of the C-25 configuration of ganoderic acid A, except for a recent 
US
patent document that claimed to have a method for the determination of the configuration of ganoderic acid A by X-ray crystallographic analysis (Hsieh, 2019). However, the patent shows a 25 
R
-isomer in the ORTEP figure, but the 25 
S
-isomer is depicted as the presented chemical structure. More confusingly, the 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectroscopic data (measured in CDCl 
3
) were apparently different from those reported in the original isolation report (

). NMR spectroscopic data (measured in CDCl 
3
) of compound 
4
isolated in the present study from 
<tp:taxon-name>
G. sichuanense
</tp:taxon-name>
were consistent with those of the original paper. The relative configuration, except for C-25, was confirmed by our own analysis of the 2D NMR spectroscopic data (similar to the structure elucidation of 
1
as described above), which also led to the full assignments of protons and carbons (
Table S1
).
</p>
         <p>
Very recently, we reported the isolation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma
</tp:taxon-name>
lanostanoids, ganoweberianic acids and ganoweberianones possessing the same 
type
of side chain as ganoderic acid A (

) and determined the 25 
S
configuration for the most abundant compound, ganoweberianic acid A, by using the PGME method (

). Therefore, this method was also applied to ganoderic acid A (
4
). The Δ 
δ
-values (
δ
(S)
– 
δ
(R))
obtained from the (
S
)- and (
R
)-PGME amide derivatives 
25a
and 
25b
, respectively, indicated the 25 
R
configuration of compound 
4
(
Fig. 4
). Consequently, acetonide derivative 
1
is also assigned as a 25 
R
-isomer. The methyl ester of 
1
, named methyl ganoderate A acetonide, was previously isolated together with methyl ganoderate A (ganoderic acid A methyl ester) from 
<tp:taxon-name>
G. lucidum
</tp:taxon-name>
, wherein the configuration of C-25 was not reported (

).
</p>
         <p>
In this study, eight other lanostanoids possessing the same C-20–C-27 side chain and close structure of the tetracyclic ring with ganoderic acid A (
4
) were isolated: ganoderic acid B (
5
) (

), ganoderic acid B8 (
6
) (

), ganoderic acid C1 (
7
) (

), ganoderic acid C2 (
8
) (

), ganoderic acid J (
9
) (

), ganoderic acid K (
10
) (

), ganolucidic acid A (
11
) (

), and ganolucidic acid C (
12
) (

). To further confirm the C-25 configuration of these compounds, two other major lanostane constituents, 
8

for PGME amide derivatives 
26a

26b
and 
27a

(

) defined the 25 
R
configuration of both 
8
and 
11
, respectively. Each of 
4–12
was isolated as a single diastereomer (not as a mixture of C-25 epimers), as confirmed by their NMR spectra. Therefore, it should be safe to conclude that all of them possess the 25 
R
configuration.

Compound 
2
had the molecular formula C 
30
H 
44
O 
6
as determined by HRESIMS. The NMR spectroscopic data of 
2
suggested a lanostane skeleton, and its planar structure was deduced from the COSY and HMBC data (
Fig. 2
). The presence of an α,β- unsaturated carboxylic acid in the side chain was indicated by the HMBC correlations from H-24 and H 
3
-27 to the carboxyl carbon (
δ
C
171.8, C-26). The 24 
E
configuration was deduced from the NOESY correlation between 
Hb-
23 (
δ
H
2,26) and H 
3
-27 and the absence of the cross-peak for H-24/H 
3
-27. The location of a conjugated ketone was revealed by the HMBC correlations from 
Hα-
12 and 
Hβ-
12 to the ketone carbon (
δ
C
200.3, C-11), from 
Hα-
1, H-7, and H 
3
- 19 to an olefinic carbon (
δ
C
139.9, C-9), and from H-7 and H 
3
-30 to a downfield olefinic carbon (
δ
C
160.1, C-8). The presence of a C-3 ketone was evident from the HMBC correlations from 
Hα-
1, 
Hβ-
1, 
Hα-
2, 
Hβ-
2, H 
3
-28, and H 
3
-29 to the ketone carbon (
δ
C
218.1, C-3). Two secondary alcohols were assigned to the C-7 and C-22 positions on the basis of the COSY correlations. An equatorial (β) orientation of H-7 was indicated by its small coupling constant values (resonated as a broad singlet) and its NOESY correlations with 
Hα-
6, 
Hβ-
6, 
Hβ-
15, and H 
3
-18 (weak). The configuration of C-22 was determined by the modified Mosher’ s method (

). Compound 
2
was converted to its methyl ester and then acylated with Mosher reagents to obtain (
S
)- and (
R
)-MTPA esters 
28a
and 
28b
, respectively (
Fig. 5
). The Δ 
δ
-values indicated the 7 
R
, 22 
S
-configuration of compound 
2
, which also confirmed the absolute configuration of the lanostane core, as depicted. In this analysis, only the Δ 
δ
-value for H 
3
-30 (+0.05 ppm) was inconsistent with the rule of the modified Mosher’ s method with regard to the discussion of the configuration of C-7. Both H 
3
-30 methyl protons were significantly upfield shifted (
28a
, 
δ
H
0.72; 
28b
, 
δ
H
0.67) when compared with that for 
2
(
δ
H
1.29). Therefore, this unusual upfield shift was not due to the shielding effect of the phenyl group of 7α- O-MTPA. This can be explained by the much larger shielding effect of H 
3
-30 by the carbonyl group of 7α- O-MTPA because of the close placement of the carbonyl π- face to 
CH
3
-30 and the rigid conformation of the ester. Thus, the Δ 
δ
-value for H 
3
-30 could be treated as an exception. Consequently, compound 
2
was identified as (22 
S
,24 
E
)-7α,22-dihydroxy-3,11-dioxolanosta-8, 24-dien-26-oic acid.
</p>
         <p>
The molecular formula of compound 
3
was determined by HRESIMS to be C 
30
H 
48
O 
4
. The NMR spectra revealed the presence of a ketone, an oxymethine, and two hydroxymethyl groups. The location of the ketone at C-3 was evident from the HMBC correlations from 
Hβ-
2, H 
3
-28, and H 
3
-29 to the ketone carbon (
δ
C
217.5). The presence of a secondary alcohol at C-7 was revealed by the HMBC correlations from H-5 and 
Hα-
6 to the oxymethine carbon (C-7) and from H-7 to C-5, C-8, and C-9. The oxymethine proton (H-7) resonated as a broad singlet with a narrow peak width, which indicated small coupling constant values and its equatorial (β) orientation. This was further confirmed by the NOESY correlations of H-7 with both 
Hα-
6 and 
Hβ-
6 and a weak correlation with H 
3
-18. Two hydroxymethyl groups were located at terminal positions (C-26 and C-27) of the C-20–C-27 side chain, which was demonstrated by the HMBC correlations from H 
2
-26 to C-24, C-25, and C-27 and from H 
2
-27 to C-24, C-25, and C-26. Therefore, compound 
3
was identified as 3-oxo-7α,26,27-trihydroxylanosta-8,24-diene.

Other known lanostane triterpenoids not mentioned above (

We searched for antitubercular and antimalarial drug lead compounds from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma
</tp:taxon-name>
(Isaka et al., 2013, 2017, 2020a). Undescribed compounds 
1–3
and selected known lanostanoids (
4
, 
6
, 
8
, 
11
, and 
13–15
) were tested for activities against 
<tp:taxon-name>
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
</tp:taxon-name>
H37Ra and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Plasmodium falciparum
</tp:taxon-name>
K1 (multidrug-resistant strain) and cytotoxicity to nonmalignant Vero cells (African green monkey kidney fibroblasts). Most importantly, ganoderiol F (
15
) exhibited potent antitubercular activity with an MIC value of 0.781 μg/ml (
Table 2
). Other 26,27-diol-type compounds, 
3
and ganoderiol B (
14
), also showed moderate antitubercular activity (MIC 6.25 μg/ml). We previously reported the antitubercular activities of mycelium-associated 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma
</tp:taxon-name>
lanostanoids and proposed their structure-activity relationships (Isaka et al., 2017). It should be noted that the side chain structures of lanostanes 
3
, 
14
, and 
15
, bearing 26,27-diol, are different from those of mycelium-associated antitubercular lanostanes, which possess (
E
)-α, β- unsaturated carboxylic acids (same as 
2
and 
13
). On the other hand, only ganolucidic acid E (
13
) showed antimalarial activity with an IC 
50
value of 7.2 μg/ml. Compounds 
14
and 
15
showed weak cytotoxicity.

3. Conclusions
</p>
         <p>
The present results further demonstrate the structural diversity and significance of the biological activities of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma
</tp:taxon-name>
lanostanoids. The 25 
R
configuration of ganoderic acid A and its derivatives were determined by using the PGME method. Taken together with our recent successful results for a 25 
S
-isomer (ganoweberianic acid A) (

), it can be concluded that Kusumi’ s PGME method performs well for the determination of the absolute configuration at C-25 of major structural groups of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ganoderma
</tp:taxon-name>
lanostanoids possessing the same or similar side chain as ganoderic acid A. Potent antitubercular activity of ganoderiol F is noteworthy.

. The mycelia were grown on PDA agar at 25 
◦
C for 15 days. Then, a 1 × 
1 cm
fungal colony was cut from the agar plate and transferred into a glass bottle containing sterile millet (7 × 
17 cm
). After incubation at 25 
◦
C for 14 days, spawn was used as the inoculum for cultivation in 120 substrate bags. Each plastic bag contained ca. 
1 kg
of substrate consisting of 92.5% (w/w) sawdust, 4.6% (w/w) rice bran, 1.8% (w/w) calcium sulfate, 0.9% calcium oxide, and 0.2% (w/w) magnesium sulfate (purchased from the Arunyik Mushroom Center). The substrate bags were incubated in a cultivation house at 27–30 
◦
C for 21 days for mycelial growth; then, the bags were opened. It required an additional 64 days at 27–30 
◦
C for induction and growth of fruiting bodies. Fruiting bodies of suitable size (
5–15 cm
stalk long) were obtained from all substrate bags and then harvested for further analysis.

4.6. Preparation of (S)- and (R)-PGME amides of ganoderic acid C2 and ganolucidic acid A
</title>
         <p>
To a solution of ganoderic acid C2 (
8
, 
2.6 mg
, 0.005 mmol), (
S
)- PGME‧HCl (
2.1 mg
, 0.01 mmol), and DMAP (
1.5 mg
, 0.012 mmol) in 
CH
2
Cl 
2
(0.4 ml) was added a solution of EDC‧HCl (ca. 
2 mg
, ca. 0.01 mmol) in 
CH
2
Cl 
2
(0.2 ml), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 40 min. The solution was diluted with EtOAc (6 ml) and washed successively with 1 M HCl (2 ml, three times) and saturated aqueous NaHCO 
3
(2 ml). The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain (
S
)-PGME amide 
26a
(
2.9 mg
). Similarly, PGME amides 
26b
(
3.1 mg
), 
27a
(3.0 mg), and 
27b
(3.0 mg) were prepared. The purities of these crude reaction products were sufficient for 
1
H NMR (CDCl 
3
, 500 MHz) spectroscopic analysis. Partial assignments of protons, including those of the C-20–C-27 side chain, were achieved by analysis of the COSY data.
