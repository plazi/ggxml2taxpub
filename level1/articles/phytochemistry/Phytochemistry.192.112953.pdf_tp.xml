Cyanobacteria are an ancient clade of photosynthetic prokaryotes, whose worldwide occurrence, especially in water, presents health hazards to humans and animals due to the production of a range of toxins (cyanotoxins). These include the sometimes co-occurring, non-encoded diaminoacid neurotoxins 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid (2,4-DAB) and its structural analogue β- N-methylaminoalanine (BMAA). Knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway for 2,4-DAB, and its role in cyanobacteria, is lacking. The aspartate 4-phosphate pathway is a known route of 2,4- DAB biosynthesis in other bacteria and in some plant species. Another pathway to 2,4-DAB has been described in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lathyrus
species.
</tp:taxon-name>
Here, we use bioinformatics analyses to investigate hypotheses concerning 2,4-DAB biosynthesis in cyanobacteria. We assessed the presence or absence of each enzyme in candidate biosynthesis routes, the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway and a pathway to 2,4-DAB derived from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), in 130 cyanobacterial genomes using sequence alignment, profile hidden Markov models, substrate specificity/ active site identification and the reconstruction of gene phylogenies. In the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway, for the 18 species encoding diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase, the co-localisation of genes encoding the transaminase with the downstream decarboxylase or ectoine synthase – often within hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (
NRPS
)-polyketide synthases (PKS) clusters, NRPS-independent siderophore (NIS) clusters and incomplete ectoine clusters – is compatible with the hypothesis that some cyanobacteria use the aspartate 4- phosphate pathway for 2,4-DAB production. Through this route, in cyanobacteria, 2,4-DAB may be functionally associated with environmental iron-scavenging, via the production of siderophores of the schizokinen/synechobactin 
type
and of some polyamines. In the pathway to 2,4-DAB derived from SAM, eight cyanobacterial species encode homologs of SAM-dependent 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl transferases. Other enzymes in this pathway have not yet been purified or sequenced. Ultimately, the biosynthesis of 2,4-DAB appears to be either restricted to some cyanobacterial species, or there may be multiple and additional routes, and roles, for the synthesis of this neurotoxin.

1. Introduction

         <p>
The non-encoded diaminoacid neurotoxin 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid (2,4-DAB) (syn: 2,4-diaminobutyric acid; α,γ- diaminobutyric acid; γ- aminobutyrine) (
Fig. 1
) was first discovered in acid hydrolysates of polymyxin antibiotics (Catch and Jones, 1948). It is widely distributed and occurs in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria (

), in the seeds of leguminous plants (Bell, 1962; 

) and as a homopolymer in

). These

neurotoxins have also been found to be co-distributed in some cyanobacterial species (Al-Sammak et al., 2014; Ros´en and Hellen¨as, 2008), but may also occur alone (Krüger et al., 2010; 

).
</p>
         <p>
The biosynthetic pathway to 2,4-DAB is well documented in other bacteria (

; 

) and in the legume 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lathyrus sylvestris
(
Nigam and Ressler, 1966
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, but it has not been established in cyanobacteria. Also, the extent of 2,4-DAB biosynthesis among cyanobacteria has not been widely determined.
</p>
         <p>
There are at least four factors contributing to the lack of knowledge concerning the presence of 2,4-DAB in cyanobacteria: (i) the biosynthetic pathway(s) in cyanobacteria are unknown; (ii) some early analytical techniques to analyse cyanobacterial extracts for the presence of 2,4-DAB and its analogues have lacked sensitivity and specificity (Cohen, 2012; Faassen et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2013; 

; Ros´en et al., 2016); (iii) whilst adequate analytical methods can unambiguously assign 2,4-DAB biosynthesis to a monocyanobacterial axenic culture, ambiguity can arise regarding toxin origin when non-axenic cyanobacterial environmental samples and laboratory cultures, and mixtures of cyanobacterial species/strains are examined; (iv) the facultative expression of 2,4-DAB biosynthesis means that lack of evidence for this toxin is not evidence of its absence under all conditions. Some of these problems are beginning to be resolved. For example, although a consensual standard method of sample preparation and analytical techniques for the identification of 2,4-DAB and BMAA has been lacking, it is now widely agreed that tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the best currently available tool for the correct identification and quantification of these neurotoxins, as it relies on four identification criteria, whilst resolving structural isomers, improving detection limits and reducing background interference (Faassen et al., 2016; Faassen, 2017; 

).
</p>
         <p>
The environmental and toxicological monitoring of cyanobacterial mass populations, for example by microscopy and by chemical, immunological, toxicological and remote sensing methods (

), is being successfully complemented by molecular genetic methods (Kurmayer et al., 2017; 

). The latter include the targeting of genes involved in the biosynthesis of specific cyanotoxins by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods (Humbert, 2017; Kurmayer et al., 2017). The contribution of molecular genetic methods to the early detection of cyanobacteria with the potential for the production of 2,4-DAB and its isomers, would similarly contribute to the overall risk management of the production of these neurotoxins. To enable this, knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway(s) for 2,4-DAB formation, with gene identification is necessary. These needs are addressed here by our bioinformatics study to test hypotheses concerning the biosynthetic pathway or pathways for 2,4-DAB in cyanobacteria.
</p>
         <p>
As suggested by 

, a possible route for the biosynthesis of 2,4-DAB is through the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway (
Fig. 2
). This pathway is utilised by bacteria, fungi and higher plants to produce four encoded amino acids; methionine, threonine, isoleucine and lysine, at various branchpoints (Jander and Joshi, 2010). The pathway starts at aspartate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1), which catalyses a reversible transamination between glutamate and oxaloacetate to yield aspartate and 2-oxo-glutarate (Jansonius and Vincent, 1987). Aspartate then serves as substrate for aspartate kinase (EC 2.7.2.4), which catalyses the formation of aspartate 4-phosphate. Aspartate 4-semialdehyde is then synthesised from aspartate 4-phosphate via the action of aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.11) (Jander and Joshi, 2010). These three enzymes are widespread in prokaryotes and are essential for their viability (Cohen, 1987; 

).

</p>
         <p>
An additional branch-point from this pathway at aspartate 4-semialdehyde begins with diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.76), which catalyses the biosynthesis of 2,4-DAB. 2,4-DAB has been described as a precursor for the biosynthesis of 1,3-diaminopropane (Ikai and Yamamoto, 1997; 

) (
Fig. 3
), and the compatible solutes ectoine and hydroxyectoine (

; 

) (
Fig. 2
). In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Acinetobacter baumannii
</tp:taxon-name>
, 2,4-DAB is also biosynthesised by the activity of diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase, utilising aspartate 4-semialdehyde as substrate (Ikai and Yamamoto, 1997). This diaminoacid is subject to decarboxylation by the activity of 2,4-DAB decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.86) to yield 1,3-diaminopropane (

, 

). Transaminases can exhibit multiple substrate specificity, and the substrate for the 2,4-DAB transaminase may differ. In a species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Xanthomonas
</tp:taxon-name>
, 2,4-DAB has been shown to be synthesised by a transaminase for 2,4-DAB, diaminobutanoate-pyruvate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.46), which uses pyruvate, instead of 2-oxo-glutarate, as the oxo-acid (

). In organisms that produce the hydrogenated pyrimidine derivative ectoine, an 
ect
operon is usually found, encompassing the genes 
ectB
(encoding diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase), 
ectA
(encoding 2,4-diaminobutanoate acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.178) and 
ectC
(encoding ectoine synthase, EC 4.2.1.108). EctC can be regarded as a marker enzyme for ectoine-producers (

). The route to ectoine biosynthesis was elucidated by 

in cell-free extracts of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ectothiorhodospira halochloris
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Halomonas elongata
</tp:taxon-name>
. It begins with the transamination of aspartate 4-semialdehyde, catalysed by diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase (enzyme 4, 
Fig. 2
), to yield 2,4-DAB, which serves as substrate for diaminobutanoate acetyltransferase (enzyme 5, 
Fig. 2
) to produce 

N
4
-

acetyl-2,4-diaminobutanoic acid. Ectoine synthase (enzyme 6, 
Fig. 2
) catalyses the ring closure reaction, leading to the end product, ectoine. A fraction of the organisms that encode the ectoine operon are capable of producing 5-hydroxyectoine through a position- and stereo-specific hydroxylation of ectoine, via the activity of ectoine hydroxylase (
ectD,
EC 1.14.11.55) (Bursy et al., 2007). Although compatible solutes are known in many cyanobacteria (Kl¨ahn and Hagemann, 2011), ectoine and hydroxyectoine have not been identified in these organisms (

). Until this present investigation, no genetic investigations have attempted to establish whether the biosynthesis of 2, 4-DAB in cyanobacteria occurs through the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway.
</p>
         <p>
In prokaryotes, toxicity-related genes are often found within specialised metabolite clusters (secondary metabolite clusters), which are synthesised by a process external to the default ribosomal system, via a non-ribosomal synthetic mechanism (
NRPS
) (Jones et al., 2010), which involves a multienzyme complex (

). Compounds that, unlike peptides, do not contain nitrogen, may be biosynthesised by similar enzyme assemblies, named polyketide synthetases (PKS) (

), and others can be synthesised through hybrid 
NRPS
/PKS complexes (Fisch, 2013). Many classes of cyanotoxins, including cylindrospermopsins, saxitoxins, nodularins and microcystins are known to be produced via these routes (Kellmann et al., 2008; 

; 

; 

). A third and less widespread category of multienzyme complexes exists in cyanobacteria, namely the NRPS-independent siderophore biosynthesis systems (NIS). NIS clusters are responsible for the production of siderophores, including rhizobactin 1021, schizokinen and synechobactin (Challis, 2005; Årstøl and Hohmann-Marriott, 2019).

1.2. Siderophores
</title>
         <p>
Siderophores are low molecular weight (400–1000 kDa) carrier molecules that function in microbial iron uptake (

). These iron-chelators are usually Fe(III)-specific, and bind Fe(III) with an affinity of the order of 
1030
. Of the compounds that are used as siderophores by cyanobacteria, two - schizokinen and synechobactin - have been shown to be synthesised following the decarboxylation of 2, 4-DAB (Balasubramanian et al., 2006; 

; Årstøl and Hohmann-Marriott, 2019).
</p>
         <p>
The low concentration of iron (picomolar to nanomolar range) in the environment is typically rate-limiting for the growth of cyanobacteria and siderophores are essential to reconcile the profound insolubility of Fe(III) with the vital need of iron in cellular activities (Cunningham and John, 2017; 

). Cyanobacteria have larger iron requirements than non-photosynthetic bacteria (

), as the processes of photosynthesis and, in some species, of 
N
2
fixation, require Fe-containing ferredoxin and nitrogenase, respectively (

). Cyanobacteria capable of producing siderophores under Fe-limiting conditions are probably at a selective advantage in microbial competition, protection from heavy-metal toxicity and bloom formation (

; Årstøl and Hohmann-Marriott, 2019).

</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
strains PCC 7120 and PCC 6411 (Goldman et al., 1983; 

), contains a derivative of 1, 3-diaminopropane (

). Synechobactins, amphiphilic cyanobacterial siderophores from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Synechococcus
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
PCC 7002 (Armstrong and Van Baalen, 1979) are identical in structure to schizokinen, except for the fully saturated fatty acid tail on one of the two α- hydroxamate groups (Ito and Butler, 2005), but also contain the same derivative of 1,3-diaminopropane (

). There is currently no biochemically substantiated biosynthetic pathway established for the cyanobacterial siderophores schizokinen and synechobactin. However, it is known that citrate-based siderophores are produced by NRPS-independent synthases (NIS) in cyanobacteria (Årstøl and Hohmann-Marriott, 2019), and that the two siderophores are structurally similar to other dihydroxamate-type siderophores, such as rhizobactin 1021 (

) and aerobactin (de Lorenzo et al., 1986). 
<tp:taxon-name>
A priori
</tp:taxon-name>
, we hypothesise that cyanobacteria use the same metabolic route. Rhizobactin 1021 is synthesised from the hydroxylation and acetylation of two molecules of 1,3-diaminopropane, which combined with citrate by a NIS synthetase, yields schizokinen (

) (
Fig. 4
).
</p>
         <p>
1.3. Polyamines
</p>
         <p>
Polyamines, polycationic hydrocarbon molecules with multiple amino groups, have important roles in prokaryotic protein synthesis (Igarashi and Kashiwagi, 2000; 

), also contributing to cyanobacterial bloom formation and siderophore production (Keating et al., 2002). Spermidine, a widespread polyamine in all groups of cyanobacteria (Hosoya et al., 2005), can be synthesised from putrescine via two different routes (
Fig. 5
). Putrescine biosynthesis is shared by both pathways and may occur via ornithine, through the action of ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) or via arginine, which serves as the initial substrate for arginine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.19), agmatine iminohydrolase (EC 3.5.3.12) and 

N

-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase (EC 3.5.1.53) (

). The classical pathway begins with the decarboxylation of SAM by S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (
SAMDC
, EC 4.1.1.50). The decarboxylated SAM and putrescine serve as substrates for the biosynthesis of spermidine, in a reaction catalysed by spermidine synthase (
SPDS
, EC 2.5.1.16) (

; 

). In the alternative pathway, carboxyspermidine dehydrogenase (
CASDH
, EC 1.5.1.43) catalyses the reaction between aspartate 4-semialdehyde and putrescine that leads to carboxyspermidine, which is then decarboxylated by carboxyspermidine decarboxylase (
CASDC
, EC 4.1.1.96) to yield spermidine (Hanfrey et al., 2011; 

). In organisms encoding diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase and diaminobutanoate decarboxylase, 1,3-diaminopropane is produced and can serve as a substrate for 
CASDH
, yielding carboxynorspermidine, which in turn is used by 
CASDC
to produce norspermidine (

; 

). Both the putative and alternative pathways for spermidine biosynthesis have been described in cyanobacteria (

). In these species, the route to norspermidine via the alternative pathway could represent another physiological role for the production of 2,4-DAB via the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway.

1.4. The biosynthesis of 2,4-DAB derived from SAM and other pathways to 2,4-DAB
</p>
         <p>
There is another known mechanism to 2,4-DAB biosynthesis. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lathyrus
species
</tp:taxon-name>
, isoxazolinones are used for the biosynthesis of both 2,3- diaminopropanoic acid (2,3-DAP) and 2,4-DAB. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pisum sativum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lathyrus sativus
</tp:taxon-name>
seedlings, β-(isoxazolin-5-on-2-yl)-alanine (BIA) was shown to be synthesised from 
O
-acetyl-L-serine (OAS) and isoxazolin-5- one by cysteine synthase (EC 2.5.1.47). 2,3-DAP can be released after enzymatic cleavage of BIA (Ikegami et al., 1991). In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lathyrus odoratus
</tp:taxon-name>
seedlings, 2-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)-isoxazolin-5-one (
ACI
), the higher homolog of BIA, is present and causes neurotoxic symptoms similar to 2, 4-DAB in experimental animals (

). This amino acid was shown to be synthesised from SAM and isoxazolin-5-one (Callebaut and Lambein, 1977; Ikegami et al., 1993). A suitable route to 2,4-DAB would be through enzymatic transfer of the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl moiety from SAM to an intermediate, which could be cleaved to yield 2,4-DAB (Ikegami and Murakoshi, 1994) (
Fig. 6
). Although the transferase from

2,4-DAB could be also formed non-enzymatically. In the protein gliadin, the neurotoxin is formed chemically from glutamine following Hoffman degradation (

1.5. Our contribution
</title>
         <p>In this study, we use bioinformatics tools to investigate hypotheses concerning 2,4-DAB biosynthesis in cyanobacteria through the assessment of the presence or absence of each enzyme in the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway and a pathway to 2,4-DAB derived from SAM, across 130 cyanobacterial genomes. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the biosynthesis of 2,4-DAB through the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway occurs but is limited to a subset of species. We highlight its potential physiological roles in siderophore and polyamine biosynthesis. We also suggest that 2,4-DAB production from SAM may be possible in some cyanobacterial species, however in-depth analyses are hindered, as candidate enzymes and intermediates participating in this pathway are lacking. Ultimately, the biosynthesis of 2,4-DAB appears to be either restricted to some cyanobacterial species, or there may be multiple and additional routes, and roles, for the synthesis of this neurotoxin.</p>

2.1. Cyanobacterial species encoding enzymes in the aspartate 4- 
phosphate

pathway

</title>
         <p>
The first three enzymes in the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway (
Fig. 2
), aspartate transaminase, aspartate kinase and aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, are widespread in cyanobacteria. These enzymes are responsible for amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism and, in the few genomes where genetic evidence for one or more of these enzymes was lacking (one instance for aspartate transaminase, five instances for aspartate kinase and four instances for aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase), we propose errors in sequencing, assembly, genome annotation or functional annotation as explanations (Supplementary 
Tables S1-S
3).
</p>
         <p>
Based on knowledge from active site and substrate specificity searches (Supplementary Tables S12-S17), from the 130 cyanobacterial species present in our dataset, diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase is believed to be present in 18 species, out of which only seven also encode diaminobutanoate decarboxylase (
Table 1
). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Xanthomonas
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
encodes a transaminase that uses pyruvate, instead of 2-oxo-glutarate, as the oxo-acid (

). In cyanobacteria a gene for diaminobutanoate-pyruvate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.46) was not found in the genome of any species.
</p>
         <p>
No cyanobacterial genomes appeared to encode diaminobutanoate acetyltransferase or ectoine hydroxylase, and only three species appear to possess the gene coding for ectoine synthase:

, proposed a biosynthetic route to rhizobactin 
1021 in
the symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sinorhizobium meliloti
</tp:taxon-name>
, where schizokinen was indicated as the preceding compound to rhizobactin 1021. Since schizokinen is an intermediary product of the siderophore rhizobactin 1021, it is possible that these siderophores share an enzymatic pathway (Årstøl and Hohmann-Marriott, 2019). The biosynthesis of synechobactin is probably an extension of the pathway to schizokinen (Årstøl and Hohmann-Marriott, 2019). Evidence supporting these statements has been provided in cyanobacteria: 

identified a cluster of genes in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Anabaena
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
PCC 7120 homologous to the biosynthesis-genes for rhizobactin 1021 and Balasubramanian et al. (2006) identified the siderophore characteristic IucABC-family proteins in an eight-gene operon, in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Synechococcus
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
PCC 7002.
</p>
         <p>
There are eight genes involved in the regulation, biosynthesis and transport of rhizobactin 1021 from 1,3-diaminopropane (

). The genes 
rhbA
, 
rhbB
, 
rhbC
, 
rhbD
, 
rhbE
and 
rhbF
are part of a single operon and function in the biosynthesis of the siderophore. The product of 
rhbA
and 
rhbB
shows similarity to the proteins diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase and diaminobutanoate decarboxylase (involved in 1,3-diaminopropane synthesis), whilst the products of 
rhbC
, 
rhbD
, 
rhbF
and 
rhbE
are homologous to the iron uptake chelate domains IucA, IucB, IucC and IucD, involved in the production of aerobactin (

). These genes are characteristic of siderophore clusters (i.e. NIS biosynthesis pathways contain at least one enzyme with conserved N-terminal iron uptake chelate domains (Årstøl and Hohmann-Marriott, 2019)), and all characterised NIS clusters known to date encode either one or the two homologous synthetases IucA/IucC (de Lorenzo et al., 1986; de Lorenzo and Neilands, 1986). These synthetases define the NIS pathway and are present in the siderophore clusters of three cyanobacterial species in the dataset (
Fig. 8
), which we propose are able to synthesise iron chelators of the schizokinen/synechobactin 
type
. Additional proteins, such as (GNAT family) N-acetyltransferase, lysine 6-monooxygenase, α/β hydrolase and transport proteins (e.g. iron-siderophore ABC transporter substrate-binding protein, ABC transporter ATP-binding protein, MFS transporter, and the TonB-dependent receptor) found in the cyanobacterial NIS clusters of 
Fig. 8
, also have similar functional annotations to the proteins in the NIS clusters of other species (Challis, 2005; 

).
</p>
         <p>
The synthesis of rhizobactin 1021 is similar to that of aerobactin (Årstøl and Hohmann-Marriott, 2019). Both iron-chelators are citrate-based hydroxamate siderophores with similar structures, differing only in the presence of a fatty acid moiety in rhizobactin 1021 and an additional carboxylic acid moiety and two saturated carbon atoms in each of the symmetrical arms of aerobactin (

). It has been argued that, if aerobactin was derived from the same substrate as rhizobactin 1021 (i.e. 1,3-diaminopropane instead of lysine), the resulting product would have the same structure as rhizobactin 1021 (

). Given this, 

proposed that 1, 3-diaminopropane is incorporated into rhizobactin 1021 by steps similar to those involved in the biosynthesis of aerobactin. However, since there is no evidence in the literature for the production of these siderophores in cyanobacteria, we hypothesise that the enzymes used for the biosynthesis of schizokinen/synechobactin in cyanobacteria also correspond to those used for the biosynthesis of aerobactin and rhizobactin 1021.
</p>
         <p>
The co-localisation of the 2,4-DAB transaminase and decarboxylase with the IucA/IucC synthetase genes, inside an NIS cluster, suggests that these enzymes provide the catalysis to 
<tp:taxon-name>form siderophores</tp:taxon-name>
of the schizokinen/synechobactin 
type
(Årstøl and Hohmann-Marriott, 2019). Hence, we propose that, in some cyanobacteria, 2,4-DAB can be biosynthesised through the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway, which is likely to play a physiological role in environmental iron-scavenging.
</p>
         <p>
Since hydroxamate siderophores have the capability of complexing with metals in addition to iron (i.e. copper, uranium) (

; 

), additional physiological roles of 2, 4-DAB as an antimicrobial agent (

) or in the detoxification of heavy metals (Årstøl and Hohmann-Marriott, 2019), respectively, may exist.

29413 were both derived from axenic cultures, and therefore, based on our genomic analyses, it seems probable that these species are able to synthesise 2,4-DAB through the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway, possibly as a by-product of the production of siderophores of the schizokinen/synechobactin 
type
. Although

</p>
         <p>Since no cyanobacterial species in the dataset encode a gene for diaminobutanoate-pyruvate transaminase, the synthesis of 2,4-DAB, where present in cyanobacteria, appears to occur via a 2,4-DAB transaminase that uses 2-oxo-glutarate, and not pyruvate, as the oxo-acid. However, the possibility of uncharacterised diaminobutanoate-pyruvate transaminase enzymes, non-homologous to those that are known, cannot be disregarded. Without further knowledge of the relevant metabolite pool sizes in cyanobacteria, particularly of pyruvate, and the kinetic properties of the transaminase, the possibility of 2,4-DAB biosynthesis in cyanobacteria via diaminobutanoate-pyruvate transaminase cannot be excluded.</p>

2.3. Co-localisation of 2,4-DAB transaminase within hybrid 
NRPS
/PKS

</title>
         <p>
and unanswered questions
</p>
         <p>
Many siderophores are polypeptides that are biosynthesised by members of the 
NRPS
multienzyme family (Challis, 2005). These siderophores are different in structure from schizokinen (Jeanjean et al., 2008). Eleven species of cyanobacteria were found to encode 2,4-DAB transaminase within hybrid 
NRPS
/PKS clusters. The product of these specialised metabolite clusters and the role played by 2,4-DAB transaminase is unknown. However, some similarity to pyoverdine clusters was found (Supplementary Table S4), possibly suggesting still unknown/uncharacterised siderophore pathways in cyanobacteria.
</p>
         <p>
Although siderophores of the schizokinen 
type
have been described in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Anabaena
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
(Armstrong and Van Baalen, 1979;

<tp:taxon-name>
Anabaena cylindrica
PCC
</tp:taxon-name>
7122. This is suggestive of a different pathway to siderophore production (i.e. not via the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway) and/or a yet-uncharacterised siderophore in this species. Our results are compatible with those of Goldman et al. (1983), who showed that 
<tp:taxon-name>

Gloeobacter violaceus

7421 was shown to encode both 2,4-DAB transaminase and decarboxylase, via adjacent genes on the genome, but not within a specialised metabolite cluster. Given that in cyanobacteria, siderophores were found to be produced in all but the most early-branching clades (Årstøl and Hohmann-Marriott, 2019), this finding may point to potentially additional and unknown physiological roles for the production of 2,4-DAB; for example, to enable this species to synthesise siderophores from 1,3-diaminopropane via a yet uncharacterised route; or to circumvent the loss of key genes essential for the production of iron chelators of the schizokinen/synechobactin 
type
in this species.

2.4. An incomplete ectoine cluster as supporting evidence for the use of the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway for the production of 2,4-DAB in cyanobacteria

01 is the only one that also possesses diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase. The genes coding for these enzymes appear adjacent on the genome and are predicted to be co-localised within an ectoine cluster (
Fig. 8
).
</p>
         <p>The fact that the genes for diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase and ectoine synthase appear adjacent on the genome of this species is compatible with our hypothesis that cyanobacteria use the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway for the production of 2,4-DAB from aspartate-4-semialdehyde.</p>
         <p>
Our results are supported by the findings of Czech et al. (2018) and 

, who showed that, when present in cyanobacteria, ectoine synthase genes appear alone (i.e. as orphan genes), and not as part of complete ectoine clusters. It is currently not clear whether the solitary ectoine synthases are remnants of previously intact ectoine biosynthetic routes, whether they were recruited by existent genes in the ectoine pathway, whether they rely on an environmental provision of substrate to ectoine synthesis, or whether they have evolved new enzymatic functions, while possibly still retaining the capability of converting

acetyl-2,4-diaminobutanoic acid to ectoine (Czech et al., 2018;

         <p>
The cyanobacterium

. In resemblance to what occurs in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pseudomonas syringae
</tp:taxon-name>
pv. syringae B728a (Kurz et al., 2010), we speculate that the diatom could provide the cyanobacterial symbiont with the substrate for the synthesis of ectoine. Genome-driven investigations of compatible solutes in the plant pathogen 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pseudomonas syringae
</tp:taxon-name>
pv. Syringae B728a indicated that this bacterium does not produce ectoine naturally under laboratory conditions (i.e. as it lacks the 
ectAB
genes), but when surface-sterilised leaves of its host plant 
<tp:taxon-name>
Syringa vulgaris
</tp:taxon-name>
were subjected to osmotic stress, ectoine production was observed (Kurz et al., 2010). The clustering of cyanobacteria in the phylogenomic studies of Czech et al. (2018) suggest that, when present, ectoine synthases in these species are probably catalytically competent.

2.5. Polyamine biosynthesis in cyanobacteria and additional potential physiological roles of 2,4-DAB
</p>
         <p>
The co-localisation of the 2,4-DAB transaminase with CASDH and CASDC could indicate another physiological role for the biosynthesis of 2,4-DAB in cyanobacteria: that of polyamine (e.g. spermidine and norspermidine) biosynthesis (
Fig. 5
).

), and are only adjacent in the genome of the latter.
</p>
         <p>
The presence, in a species, of diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase and diaminobutanoate decarboxylase with CASDH and CASDC is indicative of the ability to produce norspermidine through the alternative pathway for polyamine biosynthesis (

) (
Fig. 5
). However, the gene pair CASDH/CASDC was not found to be adjacent to, nor included in the same specialised metabolite cluster of diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase in any cyanobacterial species in the dataset. This suggests that, in cyanobacteria, the alternative pathway for polyamine biosynthesis is largely used for spermidine biosynthesis rather than norspermidine production, consistent with the findings of 

.
</p>
         <p>
However, in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Tolypothrix bouteillei
VB
</tp:taxon-name>
521301, the enzymes participating in the synthesis of spermidine via the classical pathway, SAMDC and SPDS, appear co-localised with diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase, within the same hybrid NRPS/PKS cluster (
Fig. 9
). We suggest that, in some cyanobacteria, spermidine synthesis may be linked to 2,4-DAB production, which is itself associated with the biosynthesis of yet unknown specialised metabolites, probably siderophores (i.e. the product of the NRPS/PKS cluster is currently undetermined). This would not be unprecedented as, in addition to their core physiological roles (e. g. in cell proliferation, growth and development), polyamines have been shown to be involved in microbial swarming (

), biofilm formation (

; 

) and siderophore production (Brickman and Armstrong, 1996; Griffiths et al., 1984; 

).

2.6. The route to 2,4-DAB derived from SAM: cyanobacterial species
encoding homologs of SAM-dependent 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl transferase and unanswered questions

</title>
         <p>
In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lathyrus odoratus
, ACI
</tp:taxon-name>
was shown to be synthesised from isoxazolin-5-one and SAM (Ikegami et al., 1993). The enzymatic cleavage of 
ACI
is a possible route to 2,4-DAB (Ikegami and Murakoshi, 1994) (
Fig. 6
). Bioinformatics analysis of the feasibility of this pathway in cyanobacteria is hindered as the transferase catalysing the donation of the four-carbon chain of methionine from SAM to isoxazolin-5-one has not been purified, and an enzyme capable of cleaving this complex is currently unknown. Additionally, there are no reports of isoxazolinones having been found in cyanobacteria (

), and so other candidate acceptors would be needed to test this hypothesis.
</p>
         <p>
However, SAM-dependent 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl transferases, shown to catalyse the transfer reaction from SAM, have been described (

; 

; 

), which enabled the search for homologous enzymes in cyanobacterial genomes. Homologs of SAM-dependent 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl transferase proteins, encompassing a methyltransferase fold (Fauman et al., 1999; 

) with a conserved SAM-binding pocket, were found in eight cyanobacterial species in the dataset:

Complexes resulting from the transfer of the four-carbon chain of methionine from SAM to DAG have been described in bacteria (

), plants and fungi (

), and are involved in the replacement of membrane phospholipids with non-phosphorus lipids, when phosphate becomes limited in the environment (Benning et al., 1995; Geiger et al., 1999).

         <p>Cyanobacterial species encoding SAM-dependent transferases are candidates for 2,4-DAB production derived from SAM. The purification and characterisation of the enzymes in this pathway and their specificity, as well as knowledge regarding possible acceptors for the transfer reaction are needed to further analyse the possibility of 2,4-DAB production in cyanobacteria through this route.</p>

2.7. Comparison between bioinformatics results and the analytical
chemistry data from the literature
</title>
         <p>
In an attempt to support our bioinformatics findings with analytical data from the literature, we compared our results with those of 13 studies where evidence for 2,4-DAB- or 2,4-DAB- and BMAA-producing cyanobacteria was provided (Supplementary Table S5). A scenario where a particular species is shown to encode the necessary genes needed for the biosynthesis of 2,4-DAB, and is proven to produce the same compound via analytical studies, serves as a strong indicator that this species is a 2,4-DAB-producer. On the other hand, a species that lacks the genes responsible for 2,4-DAB production, but is shown by analytical studies to produce the neurotoxin could be indicative of a false-positive result derived from a failed analytical method (especially probable if non-axenic cultures and/or low-specificity methods were employed), or suggests the existence of other, still undescribed routes to the biosynthesis of 2,4-DAB. All studies used variations of MS/MS for 2,4-DAB/BMAA identification and quantification, however only four analyses were derived from axenic cultures. Our 130 cyanobacterial species dataset and the compilation from the literature overlapped in six species: 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aphanizomenon flos-aquae

<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
and 

<tp:taxon-name>Synechococcus elongatus</tp:taxon-name>
.

All species, apart from the latter, do not appear to have genes coding for 2,4-DAB transaminase, 2,4-DAB decarboxylase, and ectoine genes. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Synechococcus elongatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, derived from an axenic culture, has a gene coding for 2,4-DAB decarboxylase, which is not included in a specialised metabolite cluster, and is lacking a gene for 2,4- DAB transaminase. This observation may suggest different routes for 2,4-DAB biosynthesis, or that there are unknown 2,4-DAB transaminase enzymes, non-homologous to those that have been characterised. The scarce amount of analytical studies using axenic cultures of clearly defined cyanobacterial species (most studies only include the cyanobacterial genus) does not allow for further comparisons.

3. Summary and conclusions
</title>
         <p>We have provided an initial bioinformatics insight into potential pathways of 2,4-DAB biosynthesis in cyanobacteria, which can lead to future experimental investigations.</p>
         <p>
The bioinformatics results point towards 2,4-DAB biosynthesis in some cyanobacterial species via the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway. In some cyanobacteria, the enzymes 2,4-DAB transaminase/decarboxylase are co-localised within NIS clusters, suggesting a functional association with siderophore biosynthesis. The fact that 2,4-DAB transaminase is found adjacent to an 
ectC
gene in one cyanobacterial species serves as supporting evidence that cyanobacteria can produce 2,4-DAB via the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway, where it can serve as a substrate for either 1,3-diaminopropane or ectoine synthesis.
</p>
         <p>
Due to the occurrence of 2,4-DAB transaminase/decarboxylase within hybrid 
NRPS
/PKS clusters, we suggest that 2,4-DAB production may also be associated with polyamine synthesis, which itself is associated with biofilm formation and siderophore production. Species in which these enzymes occur outside specialised metabolite clusters may have developed new and, as yet, unknown physiological roles for 2,4- DAB biosynthesis, or may have lost genes needed for the production of siderophores, ectoine or polyamines.
</p>
         <p>In some cyanobacterial species, 2,4-DAB may be derived from SAM. Further information regarding the enzymes in this pathway, their specificity and possible acceptors is needed to further test this hypothesis.</p>
         <p>Ultimately, the ability to synthesise 2,4-DAB via the aspartate 4- phosphate pathway and the pathway derived from SAM does not appear to be universal among cyanobacteria. This means that either 2,4- DAB is not a widespread neurotoxin in these species, or that there are additional and yet unknown pathways for the synthesis of 2,4-DAB. The presence of NIS clusters is also limited, appearing scattered in the species phylogeny. 2,4-DAB production and the presence of NIS clusters is not linked to specific environments, biochemistry or morphology.</p>

4.1. Phylogenetic reconstruction
</title>
         <p>130 high-quality cyanobacterial genomes and three outgroup genomes (one Proteobacteria, one Actinobacteria, and one Chloroflexi) were selected from RefSeq (Supplementary Material Section S4).</p>
         <p>
The genomes used were sequenced from species cultured under different conditions. The majority (53–54%) of genomes were extracted from species grown in axenic culture, whilst the remaining genomes were derived from species in non-axenic monocyanobacterial cultures (21–22%), or consisted of metagenome-assembled genomes (15–16%). The culture 
types
of the organisms yielding the remaining 8–9% of the genomes are unknown (Supplementary Table S6).
</p>
         <p>
Genome-wide protein sets were compared with BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) and clustered into orthogroups using OrthoFinder (v.2.1.2) (Emms and Kelly, 2015) with a permissive MCL (

) inflation value of 1.1 for species phylogeny reconstruction. This resulted in 9591 orthogroups of two or more sequences each (Supplementary Material Section S5). Multiple sequence alignments were generated for all orthogroups using MAFFT (v.7.307) (Katoh and Standley, 2013). Orthogroups were mapped to pre-defined reliable AMPHORA2 markers for bacteria (

). 29 orthogroups showed no strong evidence of horizontal gene transfer, or systematic deviation from the single maximum likelihood species tree, which was reconstructed from the concatenation of these 29 orthogroups using the LG + C60 + F + R substitution model in IQ-TREE (v.1.6.10) (

) (Supplementary Material Section S6). Branch support was estimated using ultrafast bootstrap with 1000 replicates (Hoang et al., 2017), the tree was rooted between the ingroup and outgroup, and the outgroup was removed. The tree was annotated using the iTOL software (

).

4.2. Profile hidden Markov models
</title>
         <p>
From the protein sequence database at the NCBI (https://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/), amino acid sequences with the same enzyme nomenclature as given in the BRENDA database (Chang et al., 2021) were selected for each enzyme in the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway (
Fig. 2
) and for SAM-dependent 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl transferase (
Fig. 6
). Sequence choice prioritised cyanobacterial proteins and, where absent/scarce, bacterial proteins. The selection of multiple sequences from the same species was avoided. The number of sequences selected for the construction of each profile hidden Markov model (pHMM) ranged from 15 to 62 (Supplementary Table S8), comparable with an average of 22 sequences used for seed alignments in the Pfam database (

). For each enzyme, multiple sequence alignments were generated using MAFFT (v.7.307), with the E-ins-I algorithm, and pHMMs were generated using HMMER (v. 3.1b2) (hmmer. org).
</p>
         <p>
Quality assessments were performed to analyse how accurate the generated pHMMs were at finding homologs, using cytochrome C oxidase subunit III, phycobilisome protein, photosystem II protein and photosystem II reaction centre M protein as positive controls (Supplementary Material Section 
S7.1
).
</p>
         <p>The pHMMs for enzymes in the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway and for SAM-dependent 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl transferase were used to search proteins of the 130 cyanobacterial genomes for homologs using HMM search in the HMMER package, with the default threshold (Evalue ≤ 0.01).</p>

4.4. Substrate specificity and active site identification
</title>
         <p>
In order to differentiate between the enzymes present in the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway (
Fig. 2
) and the pathway to 2,4-DAB from SAM (
Fig. 6
) from homologous enzymes that carry out different functions, active site and substrate specificity searches were conducted for enzymes downstream of- and including diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase, and the SAM-dependent 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl transferase, based on knowledge from the literature, indicated below.
</p>
         <p>
Sequence alignments, including information about strictly conserved sites, residues involved in ligand-binding, pyridoxal 5 
′
-phosphate (PLP)- binding, iron-binding, SAM-binding, and stabilisation of looparchitectures were available for diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase (

), diaminobutanoate acetyltransferase (

), ectoine synthase (

), ectoine hydroxylase (

; 

, 

), SAM-dependent 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl transferase (

; 

), and to some extent for diaminobutanoate decarboxylase (

). No information is currently available regarding the active site of diaminobutanoate-pyruvate transaminase. Where data were available, multiple sequence alignments were constructed for each of these enzymes using MAFFT, which comprised the significant pHMM search hits from the cyanobacterial species in the dataset, as well as sequences with known active sites and substrate specificity from the literature, listed above. Multiple alignments were visualised using Jalview (v.2.11.1.0) (

). Amino acid differences between sequences with known active sites and the significant pHMM search hits in cyanobacteria were counted, giving a Hamming distance (Supplementary Tables S12-S17). Low Hamming distance indicates well-conserved sequence at the active site. This serves as supporting evidence that the pHMM search hit in question corresponds to a true enzyme in the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway or in the pathway to 2,4-DAB derived from SAM.

4.5. Gene family phylogeny reconstruction
</title>
         <p>
To further aid in the differentiation between enzymes belonging to the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway (
Fig. 2
) and the pathway to 2,4-DAB from SAM (
Fig. 6
) from homologs with different functions, gene trees were reconstructed for enzymes downstream of- and including diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase, and the SAMdependent 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl transferase, using IQ-TREE with the amino acid substitution model chosen according to BIC at the ModelFinder step (Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017). Branch support was estimated with ultrafast bootstrap for 1000 replicates (Supplementary 
Fig. S3-S
9
). The grouping of sequences with different functional annotations was assessed. For example, in a gene phylogeny, if one sequence is included within a group of sequences with a different and consistent functional annotation, it is plausible to assume that the first sequence may have been mis-annotated and should adopt the annotation of the neighbouring branches.

4.6. Analysis of specialised metabolite clusters
</title>
         <p>AntiSMASH (v.5.1.2) (Blin et al., 2019) was used for the identification and annotation of specialised metabolite clusters in the cyanobacterial species in the dataset. Diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase and diaminobutanoate decarboxylase were checked for their co-localisation within specialised metabolite clusters and their proximity to each other. In species where these enzymes were not inserted in specialised metabolite clusters, the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) (Carver et al., 2005) was used for the localisation of the proteins in the genome, their juxtaposition, and assessment of the neighbouring genes.</p>
