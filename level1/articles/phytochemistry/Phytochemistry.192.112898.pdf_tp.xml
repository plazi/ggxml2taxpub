Lychnophora pinaster
Mart. (Asteraceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
is endemic to the Brazilian Cerrado. It is distributed along the altitudinal gradient of the mountainous ranges of the state of 
Minas Gerais
. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of altitude on the genetic diversity of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
populations and the effects of altitude and climatic factors on essential oil chemical composition. Essential oils from 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
populations from the north (North 01, North 02, and 

North 03, 
700

â859 m) and the Metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte (MhBH 01 and MrBH 02, 
1366â1498 m
) were analyzed. SNP markers from 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
in these regions and Campos das Vertentes (CV 01, CV 02, and CV 03, 
1055â1292 m
) were also analyzed. The main compounds in essential oils were 14-hydroxy-Î±- humulene (North 01 and North 03), cedr-8(15)-en-9-Î±- ol (North 02), 14-acetoxy-Î±- humulene (MrBH 01), and 4-oxo-15-noreudesman-11-ene (MrBH 02). Hierarchical cluster and heatmap analyses showed that the North and MrBH populations included five different groups, indicating the chemical composition of essential oils is distinct in each population. Furthermore, principal component analysis showed that higher altitudes (
1366 m
and 
1498 m
) in the MrBH influence the chemical composition of essential oils, and climatic factors determine the chemical composition in North region. The genetic diversity showed that most alleles are in HardyâWeinberg equilibrium and imply high genetic variation and genetic polymorphisms between populations. Furthermore, the results of Mantel tests (R = 0.3861517; 
p
= 0.04709529; R = 0.9423121; 
p
= 0.02739726) also showed that higher altitude (
&gt;
1360 m
) shapes the genetic diversity at the MrBH. The genetic structure showed that higher altitudes (
&gt;
1360 m
) contribute to the structure of the MrBH populations, but not to North and CV populations. Therefore, the altitudinal ranges of 
Minas Gerais
mountainous ranges determine the higher genetic and chemical diversity of

populations.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
The genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lychnophora
(Asteraceae)
</tp:taxon-name>
includes 35 species, of which 23 are found in different phytophysiognomies in the Brazilian Cerrado. This genus demonstrates wide interspecies morphological variation, including sizes of treelet, shrub, and (rarely) subshrub and presence of slightly branched stem branches, alternate sessile leathery and sheathless leaves, terminal inflorescences, and cypselae with inconspicuous carpopodia (

; 

; 

, 

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lychnophora
</tp:taxon-name>
is a chemically complex genus with great structural diversity of specialized metabolites, such as sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, flavonoids, and sesquiterpene lactones (

).

            <tp:taxon-name>
Lychnophora pinaster
Mart.
</tp:taxon-name>
, known as âarnicaâ and âarnica mineira,â is an endemic species at risk of extinction located in the 

campo 
<tp:taxon-name>rupestre</tp:taxon-name>

of the Brazilian Cerrado of 
Minas Gerais
. The aerial parts are used in traditional medicine in alcoholic preparations to treat inflammation, contusions, sprains, bruises, insect bites, and other injuries (

; 

). Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of compounds in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
with trypanocidal (caffeic acid, isochlorogenic acid, vitexin, isovitexin), antibacterial and anti-inflammatory (Î±- amyrin, quercetin, lupeol, stigmasterol, sitosterol), analgesic and antipyretic (friedelin) actions, corroborating popular use (

; 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Altitude variations control multiple abiotic factors such as rainfall patterns, extreme temperatures, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, soil quality, and vegetation cover (

). These, in turn, change the morphology, physiology, and genetic patterns of plant species (

; 

; 

; 

), leading to local adaptation of isolated populations (

; 

). As a consequence of isolation, different phenotypes are generated among populations (

). Altitudinal variations also alter population genetics, triggering the inbreeding process and leading to strong population structure and local adaptation of species (

; 

; 

), a decline in gene flow, and high intrapopulation variability (

; and 

).

populations collected in the mountain (
600â1250 m
) and coastal (
0â60 m
) regions of 
Italy
contained different chemical compositions: individuals from mountainous regions had significant geraniol, Î±- 
cis/trans
-bergamotene, and Î±- guaiene concentrations, while those from coastal regions had significant nerolidol, 
cis
-Î²- guaiol and 
trans

In
Brazil
, the 
Cerrado
biome is marked by extreme abiotic factors (

; 

), especially in the state of 
Minas Gerais
. 
The
evolution of the 
Cerrado
biome in 
Minas Gerais
contributed to the appearance of many endemic species (

) so that it is possible to find a large number of endemic species associated with mountainous complexes (

; 

). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lychnophora pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
is found in the 

campo 
<tp:taxon-name>rupestre</tp:taxon-name>

located in the mountain ranges (

) with wide variation in altitude (

800â2000 m

), soil, and climate conditions. The altitudinal variation of the mountain ranges of 
Minas Gerais
can function as a geographical barrier for 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
populations, reflected in the diversity and genetic structure of the population and consequent intra- and interpopulation genetic divergences. In addition, the action of climatic factors caused by altitude variations can promote variations in the chemical composition of essential oils as a response mechanism to the xeromorphic and seasonal environment of the 

campo 
<tp:taxon-name>rupestre</tp:taxon-name>

, increasing the chemical diversity of the species. However, little is known about the effects of altitudinal variations on the chemical composition of essential oils and the genetic composition of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of altitude variations on the genetic

populations, as well as altitude and climatic factors on the chemical composition of the speciesâ essential oils.

The yield of essential oils of 

five

pinaster populations varied from 0.05% to 0.18% (
Table 1
), with the highest concentrations found in the North 02 population (0.18 Â± 0.11). The Kendall ranking correlation analysis showed a low correlation between yield and altitude (R =

         <p>
0.026, 
p
= 0.69); hence, the altitude did not influence the production of essential oils of 
<tp:taxon-name>

. Furthermore, the yield presented inter-population variation (

The essential oils of 

five 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>

pinaster populations were characterized by a complex mixture mainly composed of monoterpenes (3.6â20.0%) and sesquiterpenes (3.1â74.7%, 
Table 1
). In total, 46 compounds were identified, accounting for 60.5â91.0% of the constituents of essential oils. Based on linear retention indexes and mass spectra of unidentified compounds, it could be inferred that these compounds are sesquiterpenes. However, the low abundance of these compounds did not allow their isolation, and the 
1
H and 
13
C NMR auxiliary techniques were used for their identification, especially for essential oils of the MrBH02 population.
</p>
         <p>
Essential oils of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
populations contained a high abundance of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (38.5â74.7%). The main constituents were 14-hydroxy-Î±- humulene (North 01 and North 03 populations), cedr-8 (15)-en-9-Î±- ol (North 02 population), 14-acetoxy-Î±- humulene (MrBH 01), and 4-oxo-15-nor-eudesman-11-ene for the MrBH 02 population (
Table 1
).
</p>
         <p>
The predominant chemical constituent of essential oils of the MrBH02 population was identified as norsesquiterpene 4-oxo-15-noreudesman-11-ene based on 1 D (
1
H and 
13
C NMR; DEPT) and 2D (HSQC and HMBC) NMR data. The correlations observed in the HMBC experiment between the hydrogens at Î´ 2.47 and 2.37 (H-6) with carbons at Î´ 214.81 (J-3), 152.91 (J-3), 44.35 (J-2), and 33.84 (J-3) are compatible with 15-nor-eudesman and also justify the carbonyl positioned in C-4. Furthermore, the 15-nor-eudesman-type sesquiterpenoids have been isolated from 
<tp:taxon-name>Asteraceae</tp:taxon-name>
species (

); they are characterized by NMR here for the first time from genus 

<tp:taxon-name>Lychnophora</tp:taxon-name>
.

</p>
         <p>
Although the North 02 and North 03 populations were close (
8 km
apart, 
Table S1
, 
Fig. 1
), the major constituents were divergent. The same pattern was observed for the MrBH 01 and MrBH 02 populations found 
23 km
apart.
</p>
         <p>
The cluster analysis (HCA) showed that the North and MrBH populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
were chemically distinct, generating five groups (
Fig. 2
). Furthermore, the heatmap (
Fig. 3
) generated as a function of the correlation coefficients of the substances from the 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
populations shows that each population contained a group of highly correlated compounds not found in the others. The North 01 population was strongly correlated with 13 compounds, especially Î±- copaen-11-ol, spathulenol, and mirtenal, and in the North 02 population, these compounds were mainly 
cis
-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, cedr-8(15)- en-9-Î±- ol, 14-hydroxy-(
Z
)-caryophyllene, and Î³- curcumen-15- al. The North 03 population strongly correlated with 14 compounds; it was the only population containing 
epi
-longipinanol, sesquiterpenes 2 and 3, and dehydroxy-(
E
)-linalool oxide.
</p>
         <p>
The MrBH 01 population strongly correlated with 19 substances, including geranyl acetate, viridiflorol, tridecanal, and (2 
E
)-tridecenol acetate, detected only in this population. The MrBH 02 population contained 18 compounds, of which sabinene, 
o
-cymene, Î±- thujene, terpinene, and Î±- terpineol were not detected in other populations.

The MrBH altitude varied between 1200 and 
2000 m
(

; Barros and MagalhËaes Jr., 2018). The altitudinal gradient changed the chemical composition and genetic diversity of species (

Our results show that the different regions of

Table S3
) on the chemical composition of essential oils. The chemical composition of essential oils diverged between the MrBH and North populations. Altitude influenced the chemical composition of the MrBH populations (
1366 m
and 
1498 m
), while climatic variables influenced the North populations (
700 m
â 
860 m
). In addition to altitude, the MrBH 01 population was also influenced by daily temperature variation and the MrBH 02 population by rainfall. The MrBH 01 population differed by high relative proportions of Î²- elemene, cumacrene, tridecanal, viridiflorol, geranyl acetate, and 14-acetoxy-Î±- humulene. The MrBH 02 population had a high relative proportion of terpinolene, Î±- thujene, Î²- copaen-4Î±- ol, undecanal, Î±- terpineol, terpinene, limonene, sabinene, and

2.2. Effects of altitude on the genetic variation based on SNP markers
</title>
         <p>
High mountain range altitudes alter the genetic diversity of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
, showing different genetic pools for the sampled populations, implying that altitudes determine the genetic diversity of this species. GBS libraries retained a total of 1,173,904 loci during data processing (demultiplexing and quality of reads). After filtering data, a total of 29,731 loci containing high-quality SNP markers with 91.00 bp were found (S.D. Â± 0.02, 
gstacks
), likely considered an excellent loci number to establish genetic diversity.
</p>
         <p>
Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) results showed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
has inter-population genetic diversity (Table S4). The HardyâWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) analysis performed on each allele per population indicated that most alleles are in equilibrium, confirmed by similar values between Ho and He (Table 02). Allele frequencies are expected to be in HWE, indicating that populations maintain their genetic diversity (

). Therefore, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
populations demonstrated maintenance of their genetic diversity in this study. Furthermore, results showed that all 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
populations have low nucleotide diversity, which implies genetic variation of genetic polymorphisms between populations. These populations undergo fragmentation processes due to the effect of geographical barriers, which has been reported previously for other species (

; 

; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Geographical isolation increases interpopulation diversity, and nucleotide diversity, heterozygosity, and the within-population inbreeding coefficient (FIS) describe population isolation behavior (

; 

). The populations North 01 and 02 and MrBH 02 presented negative inbreeding (FIS) values, indicating that each population is in HWE (

). Although North 03 and MrBH 01 presented positive values of FIS (0.014 Â± 0.02 and 0.007 Â± 0.02, respectively), indicating the possibility of inbreeding (

), inbreeding was not occurring because a majority of alleles followed HWE (results of chi-squared tests; 
Table 2
). Furthermore, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
populations had high allele frequencies (P) values and low nucleotide diversity values (
Table 2
), indicating a higher presence of homozygotes in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
populations. Native populations have a high frequency of homozygotes caused by changes in the landscape, habitat degradation, and other factors that partially impair gene flow (

Medicago citrina

</tp:taxon-name>
, endemic to the western Mediterranean, presents a strong population structure and fragmentation expressed by an overall FST value of 0.386 and high inbreeding values (

). A similar pattern was found for 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
populations. The geographical distance between populations was 
8â571 km
, indicating that mountainous ranges and altitudinal ranges isolate 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
populations.
</p>
         <p>
The first Mantel test, involving all sampled populations, revealed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and altitude (R =0.386; 
p
= 0.047). The second Mantel test utilized only the altitude and FST values of North (
700â900 m
) and MrBH (
&gt;
1350 m
) populations and revealed a strong positive correlation between genetic diversity and altitude (R = 0.942; 
p
= 0.027). In addition to Mantel tests, MrBH populations presented many private alleles (
Table 2
), showing a unique genetic contribution in a population, with implications for species conservation (

).
</p>
         <p>
Populations found at high altitudes (above 
1350 m
) are genetically different from populations found at altitudes below 
1300 m
. The analysis of population structure (
Fig. 6
) shows that MrBH 01 (
1498 m
) and MRBH 02 (
1366 m
) populations were genetically distinct from North populations (
Tables 2
and 
3
), contributing to the genetic divergence of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
. Altitude is one of the geographical factors with the greatest impact on the diversity of native populations, culminating in the appearance of different genetic population patterns (

; 

; 

). Populations found at high altitudes show high genetic diversity (

), increasing their ability to adapt to the biotic and abiotic factors (

), leading to the emergence of local adaptations (GarcÃ­a-FernandezÂ´et al., 2012). The high genetic diversity and structure of MrBH 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
are caused by high altitudes, selecting distinct genetic pools. Altitude variations have been demonstrated to provide a strong population structure leading to distinct genetic pools in species (GarcÃ­a-FernÂ´andez et al., 2012; 

).
</p>
         <p>
Results of the Mantel test performed between genetic matrixes (FST) and geographic distances (
Table S1
) between populations demonstrated a high correlation value (R = 0.8036307, 
p
= 0.0036). PCA performed with neutral and positive sets of SNPs selected by the BayeScan method (
Fig. S1
) and by the PCAdapt method (
Fig. S2
) also show that isolation by distance of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
populations contributes to the genetic diversity of the species. Admixture analyses (
Fig. 5
) showed that regions contain distinct genetic pools, and results of the population structure also corroborate fixation index values (FST, 
Fig. 4
). Mountain ranges in 
Minas Gerais
(

) contribute to the spatial segregation of 

<tp:taxon-name>L. pinaster</tp:taxon-name>
,

promoting isolation by distance of the species. Isolation by distance promotes spatial allelic segregation and alters the presence of alleles among populations (

), enhancing the inter-population genetic diversity. Therefore, mountain ranges geographically isolate 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
located in the North and MrBH regions, increasing the inter-population diversity of this species.
</p>
         <p>
Results show that the genetic diversity of 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
populations corroborates the variation in essential oil chemical compositions. Furthermore, studies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. ericoides
</tp:taxon-name>
indicate high chemical plasticity for this species regarding the location of each population and local environmental events (

), showing that endemic species suffer intense selection pressures due to geography and local climate, as observed for

3. Conclusion
</title>
         <p>
The present study showed that natural 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
populations have high chemical and genetic inter-population diversity according to the altitudinal variation (
700 m
â 
1498 m
). The chemical compositions of essential oils are distinct with differential sesquiterpene production, e. g., major compounds 14-hydroxy-Î±- humulene (North 01 and North 03), cedr-8(15)-en-9-Î±- ol (North 02), 14-acetoxy-Î±- humulene (MrBH 01), and 4-oxo-15-nor-eudesman-11-ene (MrBH 02). Furthermore, climatic factors influence the chemical composition of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
populations from lower (
700 m
, 
819 m
, 
859 m
) and higher (
1366 m
, 
1498 m
) altitudes influence the chemical composition in populations located in the Metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte (MrBH 01, MrBH 02). We highlight that higher altitudes (
&gt;
1360 m
) contribute to the population structure of the MrBH populations, but not to those of North (North 01, North 02, and North 03) or Campos das Vertentes (CV 01, CV 02, and CV 03) populations. Higher altitude also shaped the genetic diversity at MrBH by establishing a differential allele selection between populations.

         <p>
After manual separation of fresh leaves from branches, essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation in a Clevenger apparatus for 2 h after performing pre-tests to optimize the extraction time. The yield of essential oils was calculated on a dry basis. For each sample, three portions of fresh leaves (
1 g
/portion) were taken at the time of extraction and dried in a forced-air oven at 40 
â¦
C to constant weight to calculate leaf moisture. Essential oils were kept in a freezer at 20

         <p>
Demultiplex procedures, construction of RAD 
loci
, discovery, and annotation of SNP markers were conducted via pipeline in STACKS v.2.45 (

; 

; 

). 
Reads
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. 
pinaster
</tp:taxon-name>
samples were first demultiplexed using the 
radtags
software and individualized into different files in the. 
fastq
format based on each sampleâ s barcodes (6â8bp). Several filters were applied in this first stage to select high-quality sample 
reads
: the quality score filter (-q), the filter for eliminating readings with the non-call based function (-c), and the function that prevents the selection of barcodes with more than one 
mismatch
(-r). After this procedure, sequences with a length of 90 bp were selected, and low quality sequences were discarded. The second genotyping stage consisted of constructing an SNP catalog using the 
ustacks
software. In this software, the method for SNP selection was applied because the species does not have a reference genome, followed by the following parameters: maximum allowed distance between stacks (M = 2); maximum allowed distance for secondary alignments (N = 4, M +2); and minimum coverage with three sequences for each RAD locus (m =3). The third step consisted of constructing a common SNP catalog using the 
cstacks
software. During this process, a difference greater than two (2) between the same locus was not allowed to prevent loci from overlapping. In addition, each SNP marker was required to be present in at least 60% of total samples (-r = 0.5), with a minimum frequency restricted to 5% and observed heterozygosity (Ho) limited to a maximum of 75%.

4.5.5. Description of SNPs under positive selection
</title>
         <p>
The Bayesian approach using the BayeScan software v. 2.1 (

; 

) and the PCAdapt model (

; 

) was chosen to identify the presence of SNPs under positive selection. The Bayesian approach can identify the allelic frequency of different populations and indicate which loci are under neutral selection and which are under positive selection according to the geographical distance between populations (

; 

). The model is a logistic regression based on the overall pairwise fixation coefficient (FST) values, capable of dividing the
</p>
         <p>
genotypic effects of neutral loci and loci under positive selection, establishing frequency values for each marker. The second approach to detect SNP markers under positive selection was the PCAdapt method implemented by the 
pcadapt
package using 
R
software (

). This model also uses FST values indicated by SNP markers that make up the population structure and a series of mathematical probabilities. Furthermore, the model indicates which markers are neutral and which are under positive selection (

; 

). The PCAdapt model expresses PCA, showing how SNP markers can promote the selection process in populations under study.
