Two undescribed viomellein derivatives, xanthoelegansin and spiroxanthoelegansin, were isolated together with clavatol, sitosteanone, vioxanthin, xanthomegnin, viomellein, rubrosulphin, rubrosulphin diacetate, viopurpurin, ochratoxin A, ochratoxin A methyl ester, ochratoxin B and ochratoxin β, from cultures of the marine sponge-associated fungus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aspergillus elegans
</tp:taxon-name>
KUFA0015. The structures of the undescribed compounds were established based on an extensive analysis of 1D and 2D 
NMR
spectra as well as HRMS data. The structure of xanthoelegansin and the absolute configuration of its stereogenic carbons were confirmed by X-ray analysis. The change in conformation of xanthoelegansin was interpreted using quantum mechanical theoretical calculation data in combination with the observation of the change of the proton signals of the 1,3-dioxepine ring in 1HNMR spectra at varying temperatures. The mechanisms of the formation of xanthoelegansin and spiroxanthoelegansin from viomellein were proposed. Clavatol, sitosteanone, vioxanthin, xanthomegnin, viomellein, xanthoelegansin, rubrosulphin, rubrosulphin diacetate, ochratoxin A, ochratoxin A methyl ester, ochratoxin B and ochratoxin β were assayed for their antibacterial activity against reference strains and multidrug-resistant isolates from the environment. The tested compounds were also evaluated for their capacity to inhibit biofilm formation in the reference strains.

1. Introduction
</title>
         <p>
Fungi are considered as organisms with extraordinary capacity to produce structurally different classes of specialised metabolites with a myriad of biological/pharmacological activities. This capability may have been evolved as a result of cohabitation with other prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms in the same ecological niches (

). In order to survive and compete with other organisms in such complex ecosystems, fungi need to produce highly bioactive molecules for cell-to-cell communications or inhibiting the growth of antagonistic neighbor microorganisms (

). Among fungi, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aspergillus
</tp:taxon-name>
, with more than 330 species, not only represents some of the most common fungi in the environment (

) but is also capable of biotechnologically producing a vast number of beneficial primary and specialised metabolites (

). Indeed, Xu et al. [

], in their investigation of the antibiotic-producing marine-derived fungi, have suggested that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aspergillus
</tp:taxon-name>
was the dominant genus.

The structures of clavatol (
1
) (

), sitosteanone (
2
) (

), ochratoxin A (
9a
) (

), ochratoxin A methyl ester (
9b
) (

) and ochratoxin B (
9c
) (

) (
Fig. 1
) were elucidated by analysis of their 1D and 2D 
NMR
spectra and HRMS data as well as by comparison of their spectral data (
Tables S1
, S 
2
, S8, S9, S10 and 
Figures S1-S
4
) with those reported in the literature. Although rubrosulphin (
8a
) (

), rubrosulphin diacetate (
8b
) (

) and viopurpurin (
8c
) (

) have been described previously, only the 
1
H and 
13
C 
NMR
data of the methyl ether of rubrosulphin (
8a
) and viopurpurin (
8c
) (

; 

), and the 
1
H 
NMR
data of rubrosulphin diacetate (
8b
) (

) were reported. Therefore, we herein report complete 
1
H and 
13
C data, assigned by 2D correlations, of 
8a
, 
8b
and 
8c
(
Tables S5-S

Compound

1
H and 
13
C 
NMR
data and 2D 
NMR
correlations (
Table 1
and 
Figures S5-S
9) (

). Since 
3
was obtained as a suitable crystal, the X-ray analysis was carried out. The ORTEP view of 
3
(
Fig. 2
) shows clearly that the absolute configuration of both C-3 and C-3’ is 
R
. Moreover, the ORTEP view of 
3
(
Fig. 2
) also shows that 
3
exists as 
M, R, R
-atropisomer in a crystalline form.
</p>
         <p>
However, the 
1
H and 
13
C 
NMR
spectra (
Table 1
, 
Figures S5
and S 
6
) of 
3
displayed the signals of OH-9 and OH-10 as two pairs of doublets of very close chemical shift values at 
δH
9.708 (
J
= 1.1 Hz)/9.701 (
J
= 1.1 Hz), and at 
δH
13.806 (
J
= 1.1 Hz)/13.803 (
J
= 1.1 Hz), respectively, whereas OMe-7 also appeared as two singlets at 
δH
3.845 and 3.843, indicating that 
3
existed in equilibrium of two atropisomers in a solution. This was supported by the fact that C-1/C-1 
′
appear as two signals at 
δC
171.60 and 171.56. According to 

, the 
1
H 
NMR
spectra of 
P, R, R
-vioxanthin and 
M, R, R
-vioxanthin were identical whereas the 
13
C 
NMR
spectra exhibited small differences in chemical shift values for the carbonyl carbon of the pyranone ring (C-1 and C-1 
′
) being 
δC
171.57 in
P, R, R
- and 
δC
171.61 in
M, R, R
-atropisomers, respectively. As the 
13
C 
NMR
spectrum of 
3
(
Figure S6
) exhibited two signals of C-1/C-1’ at 
δC
171.56 and 171.60, respectively, it was suggested that 
3
exists in equilibrium of two atropisomers in the CDCl 
3
solution (
Fig. 3
).
</p>
         <p>
The 
13
C 
NMR
data (
Table 3S
and Figure S11) of 
4
were compatible with those reported for xanthomegnin by 

. However, contrary to the 15 carbon signals reported by Hofel ¨and Roser ¨ (1978), the 
13
C 
NMR
spectrum of 
4
, obtained in CDCl 
3
at 75 MHz (
Table 3S
, Figure S11), exhibited pairs of signals, with close chemical shift values, of some carbons, 
i. e.
for C-3/C-3 
′
, C-4/C-4 
′
, C-4a/C-4’a, C-5a/C-5’a, C-6/C-6 
′
, C-8/C-8’a, C-9/C-9’a, C-10/C-10’a, C-10a/C-10’a and Me-3/Me-3’. Similarly, the 
1
H 
NMR
spectrum in CDCl 
3
at 300 MHz (
Table 3S
; Figure S10) exhibited a pair of singlets at 
δH
13. 17 (lower intensity) and 13.19 (higher intensity) of the hydroxyl group at C-10, a pair of singlets at 
δH
4.164 (higher intensity) and 4.157 (lower intensity) for the methoxyl group, and a pair of methyl doublets at 
δH
1.55 (
J
= 6.2 Hz, lower intensity) and 1.57 (
J
= 6.2 Hz, higher intensity). Since xanthomegnin is a dimer of two identical monomers, these pairs of 
1
H and 
13
C signals also suggested that it exists as a mixture of 
M
and 
P
atropisomers in a solution. However, it is not possible to identify which proton and carbon signals belong to the 
P
or 
M
isomers.

Compound 
5
was identified as viomellein based on the analysis of its 1D and 2D 
NMR
spectra (
Table 3
, Figures S15-S19) and its (+)-HRESIMS 
m/z
561.1389 (M + H) 
+
(calcd for C 
30
H 
25
O 
11
, 561.1397)(Figure S73). Instead of showing only one signal for each carbon as previously reported by 

, the 
13
C 
NMR
spectrum, obtained in CDCl 
3
at 75 MHz (
Table 2
, Figure S16), exhibited pairs of signals for a majority of carbons. Similarly, the 
1
H 
NMR
spectrum (
Table 2
, Figure S15) showed a pair of signals for Me-3, Me-3 
′
, OMe-7 
′
, OH-9, OH-10 and OH-10’. This implies that 
5
also exists in equilibrium of 
P
and 
M
atropisomers in CDCl 
3
solution. However, in a crystalline form, it exists only as 
M
atropisomer as shown in the ORTEP diagram in 
Fig. 4
.

(calculated for C

H 
23
O 
11
, 559.1240)(Figure S74), indicating twenty degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands for hydroxyl (
3445 cm

), conjugated ketone carbonyl (1732, 
1717 cm
1
), olefin (
1649 cm
1
), aromatic (1559, 
1541 cm

) and ether (

) groups. The general features of the 
1
H and 
13
C 
NMR
spectra of 
6
(
Table 3
, Figures S20 and S21) resembled those of 
5
with some small differences. The 
1
H 
NMR
spectrum in CDCl 
3
(
Table 3
, Figure S20) displayed two pairs of singlets of hydrogen-bonded hydroxyls at 
δH
13.034
/ 
13.017
and 
δH
12.962
/ 
12.933
, three singlets of aromatic protons at 
δH
7.56, 6.98 and 6.95, three doublets (all integrated for two protons) from higher to lower intensity at 
δH
6.08 (
J
= 4.6 Hz), 6.02 (
J
= 4.6 Hz) and 5.98 (
J
= 4.6 Hz), two multiplets at 
δH
4.78 (1H) and 4.71 (1H), a methoxyl singlet at 
δH
3.89 (3H), two overlapped multiplets at 
δH
2.98 and 3.05 (4H), and two methyl doublets at 
δH
1.56 (
J
= 6.0 Hz) and 1.57 (
J
= 6.0 Hz), respectively. The 
13
C 
NMR
spectrum (
Table 3
, Figure S21) displayed several pairs of signals which, in combination with DEPTs and HSQC (Figure S24) spectra, can be categorized as two ketone carbonyls at 
δC
186.0 (C-9 
′
) and 179.0 (C-6 
′
), conjugated ester carbonyls at 
δC
170.99/ 170.88 (C-1), 163.4 (C-1 
′
), five non-protonated oxygen-bearing sp 
2
at 
δC
163.07/162.98 (C-10), 162.58/162.52 (C-10

),158.61/158.57 (C-7), 157.49/157.41 (C-9), 153.42/153.31 (C-7 
′
), eleven non-protonated sp 
2
at 
δC
147.76/147.54 (C-4’a), 141.12/141.08 (C-5a), 136.00/135.87 (C- 4a), 134.82/134.51 (C-5’a), 129.33/129.18 (C-8 
′
), 116.3 (C-10’a), 116.2 (C-9’a), 115.89/115.81 (C-8), 112.0 (C-9a), 101.8 (C-10a), three protonated sp 
2
at 
δC
116.6 (C-5 
′
), 115.36/115.27 (C-5), 104.15/104.11 (C-6), two oxymethine sp 
3
at 
δC
75.99/75.91 (C-3) and 74.74/74.64 (C- 3 
′
), one oxymethylene sp 
3
at 
δC
105.41/105.27 (C-11), two methylene sp 
3
at 
δC
35.1 (C-4) and 36.12/35.86 (C-4 
′
), and two methyl carbons at 
δC
20.65/20.60 (Me-3) and 20.79 (Me-3 
′
). The obvious difference between the structures of 
5
and 
6
is the presence of two methoxy and three phenolic hydroxyl groups in the former and one methoxy and two phenolic hydroxyl groups, in addition to the dioxymethylene group (
δC
105.41/105.27; 
δH
6.08, d, 
J
= 4.6 Hz) in the latter. Moreover, the presence of another two doublets at 
δH
6.02 (
J
= 4.6 Hz) and 
δH
5.98 (
J
= 4.6 Hz) in 
6
also was unprecedented in the naphthopyranone fungal pigments. The HMBC spectrum (
Table 3
, Figure S25) exhibited correlations from the singlet at 
δH
6.95 (H-6) and the singlet at 
δH
3.89 (OMe- 7) to the carbon signals at 
δH
158.61/158.57 (C-7) whereas the doublet at 
δH
6.08 (
J
= 4.6 Hz) showed cross peaks to C-7 and the carbons at 
δC
157.49/157.41 (C-9). The NOESY spectrum (Figure S23) also showed correlation from H-6 to OMe-7. Taking the proton and carbon chemical shift values of the methylene group and the HMBC correlations into consideration, a dioxymethylene bridge was placed between C-7 
′
and C- 9.

         <p>
Since the 
NMR
spectra of 
6
show signal doubling on most of its nuclei (Figures S20, S21, S26, S31), it was hypothesized that this was due to the presence of slow conformational equilibria at the 
NMR
time scale. Notably, the H-11 diastereotopic geminal protons exhibit a somewhat unexpected signal pattern that was explained by proposing slow exchange between the two conformations of the central ring. Experimental evidence for the exchange process came from 
1
H 
NMR
spectra of 
6
, in DMSO 
‑d
6
, at varying temperatures (Figures S26-S30). As shown in 
Fig. 6
for H 
2
-11, we observed that all doubled signals progressively broaden and begin to get closer as the temperature is increased, indicating the presence of slow exchange between conformations that progresses to a faster exchange regime with temperature.
</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>
Quantum mechanical theoretical data were also calculated in an attempt to obtain further explanations for the experimental 
NMR
observations and further insight on the phenomenon. A representative collection (2 kcal/mole Gibbs energy window, 298 K) of the most stable conformational models of 
6
(
R
, 
R
-configuration) was used to predict the relative abundance of its conformers and the resulting 
1
H 
NMR
spectrum. It was found that the most stable conformers of 
6
can be organized in two groups, G1 and G2, corresponding to the two conformations of the central ring. These two conformational groups are well represented by the leftmost and rightmost models in 
Fig. 6
, where the transition state (TS) model for G1/G2 conversion is presented in the middle.
</p>
         <p>
The calculated populations are about 59% for the conformational group G1 and 41% for the conformational group G2. This allows the assignment of H-11 signals to G1 and G2 groups since the integral of the doublet at 
ca.
6.00 ppm (labeled G1/ 
Hb
, 54%) is slightly bigger than the integral of the doublet at 
ca.
5.95 ppm (labeled G2/ 
Ha
, 46%), respectively. The simulated 
NMR
spectrum assisted in assigning 
Ha
and 
Hb
to the 
NMR
signals because the calculated chemical shift value of the proton that is spatially nearer the quinone ring (top parts of the models in 
Fig. 7
) is consistently slightly higher than that calculated for its geminal neighbor, hence the assignments are presented in 
Fig. 7
.
</p>
         <p>
The calculated Gibbs energy for the transition state (TS) model is higher than average G1’s by 21.5 kcal/mole and average G2’s by about 21.3 kcal/mole. These activation energies enable to calculate the average first order rate constants

= 0.006 Hz. This value is much smaller than the frequency difference between 
Ha
signals (
ΔG1/Ha and G2/Ha
~30 Hz) and between 
Hb
signals (
ΔG1/Hb and G2/Hb
~ 50 Hz) which clearly explains why 
6
exhibits slow exchange in the 
NMR
spectra at room temperature. Theoretical and experimental data (extrapolating from spectra in 
Fig. 6
) suggest that temperature would probably have to be raised above 100 
◦
C to start observing fast exchange (no signal doubling) in the 
NMR
spectra. The predicted first order half-life for G1/G2 conversion is ln(2) 

/ 

kexchange

= 115 s, which means effective conformational equilibrium at room temperature is expected to be reached within 15 min if starting from only one of the central ring conformations, G1 or G2.
</p>
         <p>
The experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectrum of 
6
was measured but no signals were detected. This is probably the case of extremely low absorption differences between left and right polarized light since the concentration values and the acquisition parameters used for 
6
typically give strong ECD spectra for other chiral organic molecules.
</p>
         <p>
Compound 
6
can be hypothesized to be derived from viomellein (
5
) by a mechanism analogous to the formation of methylenedioxy group of the benzene ring of many natural products (

) as shown in 
Scheme 1
. Since the X-ray analysis of viomellein (
5
) revealed that the predominant atropisomer is 
M, R, R
(
Fig. 5
), a nucleophilic attack of the oxymethylidene group, formed by oxidation at the methoxy group on C-7 
′
, by the phenolic hydroxyl group on C-9 resulted in a formation of a 1,3-dioxepine ring, connecting the two monomers through C-8/C-8 
′
and C-9/C-7’. Since 
6
has never been reported previously, it was named xanthoelegansin. Compound 
6
is the first analogue of naphthopyranone dimers possessing a 1,3-dioxepine ring.

(calculated for C

H 
22
O 
11
, 559.1240) (Figure S75), indicating 20 degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands for hydroxyl (

), olefin (
1606 cm

H and 
13
C

spectra of 
7
(

6.
The 
1
H 
NMR
spectrum, at 500 MHz, of 
7
(

δH

δH
12.760

12.752
(one proton), characteristic of hydrogen-bonded phenolic groups, three singlets of aromatic protons at

δH
1.54 (

J

6
, the 
13
C 
NMR
of 
7
(
Table 4
, Figure S33) showed several pairs of carbon signals, with different intensity, indicating the presence of two major conformers. In conjunction with DEPT, HSQC (Figure S35) and HMBC (Figure S36) spectra, the 
13
C 
NMR
spectrum of 
7
exhibited, besides signals of a conjugated ketone carbonyl at 
δC
197.0 (only observed in the HMBC spectrum), two carbonyls of a 1,4-naphthoquinone at 
δC
183.5 and 
δC

carbons at

3
at 
δC

3
at 
δC
36.07 and 35.94/35.80 and two methyl carbons at 
δC
20.6 and 20.7. That 
7
contains the same 6- methyl-2-pyrano-1,4-naphthoquinone portion as that of 
5
and 
6
was substantiated by the presence of C-6’ (
δC
176.59/176.53) and C-9’ (
δC

δH

CH

δH
1.55, d,

= 6.2 Hz). This was corroborated by HMBC correlations (
Table 4
, 
Fig. 8
and S36) from H-5 
′
to C-4 
′
, 6 
′
and the carbon signals at 
δC
115.56/115.49 (C-9’a) and 117.58/117.76 (C-10’a), and from OH-10 
′
to C-9’a, C-10’a, and the carbon signals at 
δC
162.77/ 162.70 (C-10 
′
). That another portion of the molecule contains a 6,7- disubstituted 8-hydroxyisochromone moiety was corroborated by the presence of a singlet of the aromatic proton at 
δH
6.58 (H-5/ 
δC
116.9), a singlet of the hydrogen-bonded phenolic hydroxyl at 
δH
13.07 (OH-10), a multiplet of an oxymethine proton at

4.68 (H-3/

δC
36.07) and a methyl doublet at 
δH
1.54, 
J
= 6.2 Hz (Me-3/ 
δC
20.6). This was confirmed by HMBC correlations (
Table 4
, 
Fig. 8

, C-8 to C-11 and C-11 to C-7

7
was proposed as shown in

Compound 
7
can be hypothesized to be derived from viomellein (
5
) by a mechanism similar to that proposed for the formation of the 1,3- dioxepine ring in 
6
. Oxidation of the methoxy group on C-7 
′
of viomellein (
5
), followed by nucleophilic addition by a carbanion at C-8, formed by keto-enol tautomerization, of the oxymethylidene group resulted in a formation of the spiropyran ring as shown in 
Scheme 2
. Based on these assumptions, a nucleophilc attack of the oxymethylidene group on C-7’ by the C-8 carbanion would generate the 
S
configuration on C-6. Literature search revealed that 
7
has never been previously isolated, thus it was named spiroxanthoelegansin.

Several studies have demonstrated that cytochrome P450 enzymes mediated a formation of a methylenedioxy bridge in plant specialised metabolites (

; 

). To the best of our knowledge, there is no study concerning the characterization of cytochrome P450 responsible for a methylenedioxy bridge formation in fungi. This might be due to the fact that most of fungal specialised metabolites normally do not possess a methylenedioxy group. On the other hand, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are abundant in fungi and play diverse and pivotal roles in versatile metabolism and fungal adaptation to specific ecological niches (

). Therefore, the formation of the 1,3-dioxepine ring in 
6
and the spiropyran ring in 
7
could be mediated by cytochrome P450 proteins present in the strain KUFA0015 of 

<tp:taxon-name>A. elegans</tp:taxon-name>

data, COSY, HSQC and HMBC correlations (Table S11; Figures S67-S71) of

allowed to identify it as ochratoxin β. Although ochratoxin β was previously obtained by synthesis as well as by hydrolysis of ochratoxin B (

), there is no report of its

and other physical data in any literature. Recently, 

, in their work on genome sequencing of 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. ochraceus
</tp:taxon-name>
to study ochratoxin A biosynthetic pathway, have hypothesized that ochratoxin β is produced by 7-methylmellein by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (OtaC). Combination of ochratoxin β with L-β- phenylalanine, catalyzed by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (OtaB), resulted in a formation of ochratoxin B. However, it is not possible to prove if ochratoxin β (
10
), isolated in this work, was produced by the fungus or by hydrolysis of ochratoxin B (
9c
) which was co-isolated in this work. Based on the biogenetic consideration, the absolute configuration of C-3 of 
10
must be the same as that of

The antimicrobial activity of 
1–10
against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria was evaluated by a disc diffusion method as well as by determination of their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against several reference strains as well as environmental and clinical multidrug-resistant isolates. In the disc diffusion assay, there was a halo of growth inhibition for all Gram-positive strains exposed to

</p>
         <p>
Their MBC values were equal to or two-fold higher than their MIC values, indicating a bactericidal effect. Compound

also exhibited a bactericidal effect, and its MIC values were 4–8 μg/mL for

</tp:taxon-name>
B3/10, as it is higher than 16 μg/mL, the highest concentration that could be essayed in order to keep in-test concentrations of DMSO below 1%. Compound 
7
displayed MIC values between 8 and 16 μg/mL for all Gram-positive strains, however, it was not possible to determine its MBC values in the range of concentrations tested (higher than 64 μg/mL), suggesting that this compound has a bacteriostatic effect. The MIC values for 
4
were between 16 and 32 μg/mL for all Gram-positive strains, however, its MBC values could not be determined since the highest concentration tested was 32 μg/mL to keep in-test concentrations of DMSO below 1%. None of the compounds were active against Gram-negative bacteria.

The ability of 
1–10
to prevent biofilm formation was evaluated on all three reference strains by measuring a total biomass. Compounds that showed a statistically significant reduction (one sample

ATCC 29212 and 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. aureus
</tp:taxon-name>
ATCC 29213, while keeping in-test concentrations of DMSO below 1%. For all others, since it was not possible to determine their MIC values, the highest concentration tested in previous assays was assessed. Despite no antibacterial activity was shown in the range of concentrations tested, 
1
, 
2
and 
10
were able to significantly inhibit biofilm formation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. coli
</tp:taxon-name>
ATCC 25922 whereas 
10
also inhibited biofilm production by 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
ATCC 29213. Similarly, 
8b
showed an inhibition of biofilm formation by 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. faecalis
</tp:taxon-name>
ATCC 29212. Interestingly, the compounds possessing antibacterial activity, 

i. e.
3

, 
4
, 
5
and 
9b
, almost completely inhibited biofilm formation by 
<tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
reference strains at MIC and 2xMIC. Moreover, 
4
and 
9b
also displayed significant inhibition at ½ MIC.
</p>
         <p>
In terms of antibacterial activity, 
3
is the most promising compound showing a potent activity against all Gram-positive reference and multidrug-resistant strains tested. These results call for a more in-depth study of this compound including the mechanisms underlying its antibacterial activity.

Single crystals were mounted on cryoloops using paratone. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 290 K with a Gemini PX Ultra equipped with 
CuKα
radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å). The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 and refined with SHELXL-97 (

). Non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were either placed at their idealized positions using appropriate HFIX instructions in SHELXL and included in subsequent refinement cycles or were directly found from difference Fourier maps and were refined freely with isotropic displacement parameters.

The effect of the tested compounds on bacterial biofilm formation was evaluated by quantification of total biomass, using the crystal violet method, as previously described (

A control with appropriate concentration of DMSO as well as a negative control (TSB alone) was included. Sterile 96-well flat-bottomed untreated polystyrene microtiter plates were used.

570 nm
in a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific Multiskan® EX, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,

4. Conclusions
</title>
         <p>
Two undescribed viomellein derivatives, xanthoelegansin (
6
) and spiroxanthoelegansin (
7
) were isolated, together with previously reported naphthopyranone fungal pigments vioxanthin (
3
), xanthomegnin (
4
), viomellein (
5
), rubrosulphin (
8a
), rubrosulphin diacetate (
8b
), viopurpurin (
8c
), and other specialised metabolites including clavatol (
1
), sitosteanone (
2
), ochratoxin A (
9a
), ochratoxin A methyl ester (
9b
), ochratoxin B (
9c
) and ochratoxin β (
10
), from the marine-derived fungus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aspergillus elegans
</tp:taxon-name>
strain KUFA0015, which was obtained from the marine sponge 
<tp:taxon-name>
Monanchora unguiculata
</tp:taxon-name>
. The structures and absolute configurations of the stereogenic carbons of 
3
, 
5
and 
6
were confirmed by X-ray analysis. The presence of a 1,3-dioxepine ring in 
6
and a spiropyran ring in 
7
are unprecedented among the previously reported naphthopyranone fungal pigments. Moreover, the conformational change of the 1,3-dioxepine ring in 
6
was interpreted by the observation of the 
1
HNMR spectra in DMSO 
‑d
6
at varying temperatures together with the calculated quantum mechanical theoretical data. The mechanisms of the formation of the 1,3-dioxepine ring in 
6
and the spiropyran ring in 
7
, from 
5
, were proposed. Although 
3
, 
4, 5
and 
9b
displayed a halo of growth inhibition for all the Gram-positive strains, 
3
is the most promising compound showing a potent activity against all Gram-positive reference and multidrug-resistant strains tested. Moreover, 
3
, 
4
, 
5
and 
9b
were found to almost completely inhibit biofilm formation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. faecalis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. aureus
</tp:taxon-name>
reference strains at MIC and 2xMIC concentrations. Therefore, naphthopyranone fungal pigments can be considered as a group of specialised metabolites with high potential for further development as arsenal against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
