         <p>Abstract.
In the Pacific Ocean, the taxonomy of the family 
<tp:taxon-name>
Zosimeidae 
Seifried, 2003</tp:taxon-name>
is poorly understood and to date only five species of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime
Boeck, 1873
</tp:taxon-name>
are known. During oceanographic cruises exploring the species diversity of harpacticoids, two undescribed zosimeid copepods were sampled from shallow Korean waters and the deep northwestern Pacific. A detailed morphological examination has led us to propose two new genera, 
<tp:taxon-name>Heterozosime</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
for the Korean zosimeid 
<tp:taxon-name>H

            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Acritozosime</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
for the deep-sea zosimeid 
<tp:taxon-name>A. spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
Both new genera exhibit a distinctive feature in that the first thoracic leg has a two-segmented exopod, in contrast to the three-segmented exopod of this leg in all known zosimeid genera. Furthermore, 
<tp:taxon-name>Acritozosime</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
can also be discriminated from other genera by the two-segmented endopod in second to fourth thoracic legs and the reduced setal armatures of the second exopodal segment of antenna, the first endopodal segment of first to third thoracic legs and the third exopodal segment in second to fourth thoracic legs. A comparison of the fundamental structures of appendages suggests that 
<tp:taxon-name>A. spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
experienced a unique evolutionary history within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>

         <p>
In a revision of the phylogeny of 
<tp:taxon-name>Harpacticoida Sars, 1903</tp:taxon-name>
, 
Seifried (2003)
removed three genera (
<tp:taxon-name>Peresime
Dinet, 1974
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudozosime
T. Scott, 1912
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime
Boeck, 1873
</tp:taxon-name>
) from the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae Lang, 1944</tp:taxon-name>
and combined them into a new family, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Zosimeidae 
Seifried, 2003</tp:taxon-name>
. The monophyly of the family is supported by many autapomorphies, e.g., the mandibular palp exhibits a small one-segmented exopod, a stenopodial maxilliped and a unique fifth leg in both sexes (
Seifried 2003
; 
Koller &amp; George 2011
). Most of the 25 known species have been recorded from the Atlantic Ocean, but their geographical distribution is wide and it is estimated that the species diversity is high (
Koller &amp; George 2011
; 
Kim &amp; Lee 2019
). Zosimeid copepods are found in sedimentary environments in both shallow and deep waters; only 
<tp:taxon-name>Z
. 
mediterranea
Lang, 1948
</tp:taxon-name>
was described from an algal assemblage (
Seifried 2004
). In harpacticoid communities of deep-sea regions (abyssal and hadal areas), the taxon is occasionally very abundant and species-rich (e.g., 

Kitahashi 
et al
. 2013

; 

George 
et al
. 2014

; 
Pointner 2017
; 

Schmidt 
et al
. 2019

).
</p>
         <p>
In the Pacific Ocean, only five named species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
are known: 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime pacificaFiers, 1991</tp:taxon-name>
(ranging from the littoral region to the deep sea of the Santa Maria Basin) (
Fiers 1991
), 
<tp:taxon-name>Z

and 
<tp:taxon-name>Z

(all from littoral regions of the Southern Sea, 
Korea
) (

Kim 
et al
. 2016

; 
Kim &amp; Lee 2019
). However, many undescribed oceanic species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudozosime</tp:taxon-name>
have been reported in certain ecological studies (e.g., 

Shimanaga 
et al
. 2004

; 

Kitahashi 
et al
. 2013

; 

Schmidt 
et al
. 2018

, 
2019
). As emphasized by 
Koller &amp; George (2011)
, the low number of known species is attributable to the lack of taxonomic studies, not species scarcity.
</p>
         <p>
When taxonomically studying harpacticoid copepods from shallow waters off the Korean Peninsula and the deep Pacific Ocean, we found two new taxa closely related to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
. All zosimeid copepods have a first thoracic leg with a three-segmented exopod; this ramus is two-segmented in our two new taxa, thus not meeting any known zosimeid genera. We here describe these two new taxa and discuss their taxonomic positions within the family.

Two new zosimeid genera were found in sediment samples collected from shallow waters of the Southern Sea of 
Korea
and in deep waters in the northwestern Pacific (

, 
Table 1
) during oceanographic cruises aboard the research vessels 
EARDO
, 
ONNURI
and 
ISABU
. Samples were collected using a Smith-McIntyre grab, a multiple corer, and a box corer, and were freshwater-sieved through a 50-μm pore-diameter net, and immediately fixed in 10% formalin. We extracted meiofaunal organisms from sediment by the centrifugal method using Ludox HS-40 
®
solution (
Burgess 2001
) in the laboratory. Zosimeid copepods were examined under a stereo microscope (Leica M165C, 
Germany
) and temporarily mounted on slides to allow morphological examinations seeking new taxa. All line drawings were prepared using a drawing tube attached to a differential interference contrast microscope (Leica DM2500, 
Germany
). After examination, the dissected parts of the 
type
series were mounted (in lactophenol solution) on H-S slides (

Shirayama 
et al
. 1993

) and stored in the Marine Biodiversity Institute of 
Korea
(
MABIK
), Seocheon, 
Korea
and the Marine Interstitial fauna Resources Bank (MInRB) of the 
Korea
Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST), 
Busan
, 
Korea
. The morphological terminology is adopted from 
Huys &amp; Boxshall (1991)
. Scale bars are in micrometers.

            <p>Etymology</p>
            <p>
The generic name is a combination of the Greek ‘ 
heteros
’ (‘different’) and the name of the 
type
genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime</tp:taxon-name>
. This reflects the close relationship with 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime</tp:taxon-name>
, but recognizes the significant difference in the P1 exopod segmentation.

            <p>Etymology</p>

The species epithet reflects the Latin adjective ‘ 
<tp:taxon-name>tenuis</tp:taxon-name>
’ (‘thin’ or ‘weak’), referring to the very small seta on the distal margin of P4 enp-3.

HABITUS (

). Subcylindrical, slightly depressed dorsoventrally, tapering posteriorly, with inconspicuous distinction between prosome and urosome. Rostrum (

) large, triangular, fused with cephalothorax basally; anterior tip bifid, with 2 long sensilla; anterior half ornamented with fine setules laterally. Cephalothorax large, with almost parallel lateral margins in dorsal aspect. Second to fourth free pedigerous somites tapering posteriorly. Urosome (

, 

) comprising P5 bearing-somite, genital double-somite, 3 free abdominal somites, more slender than prosome, tapering posteriorly; urosomites except for penultimate and anal somites with ventrolateral pleural extensions bearing sensillum distally. Genital double-somite (

,

5 in
both sexes, which are identical with autapomorphies given by

typica
-group of 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime</tp:taxon-name>
, as defined by 

Kim 
et al
. (2016)

, on the basis of certain features such as the mandibular endopod with four setae; the maxillulary free endopod with six elements; the outer spines of the P1 exopod with gradually increasing outer spinules toward the distal end; the typical female P5 with a deep incision between the exopod and endopodal lobe and a well-developed cylindrical outer setophore; and the outermost seta of the P5 exopod displaced by a small peduncle toward the surface in both sexes. However, it is identified by a two-segmented exopod in the P1. All known zosimeid copepods exhibit constant P1 segmentation with a three-segmented exopod.

            <p>
The two-segmented exopod in P1 is not common within the

A 
paratype
female specimen (
MABIK
CR00247791) exhibits two abnormal conditions in the P4 enp-1 and P5 exopod. The right leg of the P4 lacks an inner seta on the proximal endopodal segment (

, arrowhead) and the left leg of the P5 has four setae on the exopod (

, arrowhead). These setal abnormalities were not detected in other examined specimens.
</p>
            <p>Remarks</p>
            <p>
Interestingly, this new species exhibits several characteristics intermediate between those of the families 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
. Detailed morphological examination revealed that certain characteristics of the antenna and maxilliped resemble those of idyanthid copepods. The antenna of 
<tp:taxon-name>Acritozosime spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
shares the presence of two elements on the proximal exopodal segment with the idyanthid genera 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthe
Sars, 1909
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella
Sars, 1905
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyellopsis
Lang, 1948
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>NematovoraxBröhldick, 2005</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella
Sars, 1909
</tp:taxon-name>
(all known zosimeid copepods have only one seta); and the distal endopodal segment bears seven elements as in members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
(zosimeid species have at most six setae). The maxilliped of 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
resembles those of idyanthid copepods in the presence of a joint between the syncoxa and basis and the presence of two setae on the syncoxa (members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
have no setae on that segment, except for 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime eliasiPointner, 2017</tp:taxon-name>
having one seta). However, this new taxon also seems to have a close affinity with the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
as shown by the following features: (1) the female antennules are short, robust and armed with stout tri-spinulose setae; this is not the case in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
other than 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella</tp:taxon-name>
; (2) the distal endopodal segment of the antenna has a lateral armature composed of three elements (vs four setae in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (3) the mandibular endopod has only one lateral seta (vs 2–3 setae as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthe</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (4) the mandibular exopod is one-segmented, with four setae (vs two-segmented, with four setae on proximal segment and two setae on the distal one as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Styracothorax</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (5) the maxillular exopod is smaller than the endopod (vs longer than the endopod as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyellopsis</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (6) all endites on the maxillary syncoxa are displaced toward the anterior half (vs the praecoxal endite is displaced toward the proximal half as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (7) the maxilliped has a small and almost square endopod bearing four non-geniculate elements (vs with geniculate setae or strong claws as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthe</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Meteorina</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Styracothorax</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (8) the P1 enp-1 is almost square (vs elongate and broadened at the level of the inner element in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); and (9) the shape of the female P5 is similar to that of 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime bathybia
Bodin, 1968
</tp:taxon-name>
, although the number of setae on the exopod differs.
</p>
            <p>Seifried (2003)
listed four significant autapomorphies of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
: (1) the mandibular exopod has a long proximal segment bearing four setae and a small distal segment bearing two setae; (2) the maxillulary exopod is elongate; (3) the P1 enp-1 is elongated and broadened at the level of the inner seta; and (4) the proximal outer seta on the female P5 exopod is inserted near the basis. 
<tp:taxon-name>Acritozosime spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
does not share these characteristics. Instead, this new species exhibits several autapomorphies of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
in the antennary endopod, mandibular both rami, maxillulary exopod, maxillary syncoxa, maxillipedal endopod and P1 endopod as mentioned above (characters 
2–8 in
the previous paragraph). Therefore, we suggest that an allocation of 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
is more reasonable; the organism retains certain plesiomorphic conditions (at least in the antenna and maxilliped) of Idyanthidimorpha, as noted above. Within the Idyanthidimorpha, the sexual dimorphism of the male P2 is a clue to the taxonomic position of the harpacticoids (Moura &amp; Martínez Arbizu 2004; 
Bröhldick 2005
). Unfortunately, we could not confirm this character state because we lacked males of the new species.
</p>
            <p>
Within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
, the most conspicuous characters of 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
are the reduced segmentation and setal armature of the thoracic legs. The new species shares the two-segmented endopod in the thoracic legs with 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudozosime</tp:taxon-name>
, but differs from it by the reduced setal armature; the inner element of the proximal endopodal segment is lost in P1–P3; the distal exopodal segment in P2–P4 has two outer spines instead of three. All zosimeid copepods have one or two inner setae on the distal endopodal segment of P1, while these are lacking in 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
            </p>
            <p>
This new species is also characterized by the following unambiguous features: (1) the loss of abexopodal elements on the proximal endopodal segment of the antenna (present in other zosimeid genera); (2) the lack of an epipodal element on the coxa of the maxillule (present in other zosimeid genera); and (3) the caudal seta 
V
is notably elongated, being at least 80% of the total body length.

            <p>Diagnosis</p>
            <p>Body subcylindrical, with inconspicuous distinction between prosome and urosome; urosomites except penultimate and anal somites with pleural extensions; genital somite and first abdominal somite fused ventrally in female, forming genital double-somite. Penultimate somite with pseudoperculum comprising several projections. Rostrum undefined at base, with 1 pair of long sensilla distally, ornamented with lateral setules. Caudal rami elongate, longer than length of anal somite. Antennule robust, 6-segmented, with ae on second and distal segments, respectively. Antennary exopod 3-segmented; setal armature, from proximal: 1.1.4. Mandibular palp well-developed, with 3 setae on basis; exopod 1-segmented, with 3 setae; endopod 1-segmented, with 4 setae. Maxillular coxa with epipodite represented by 1 seta; exopod 1-segmented, with 3 setae; endopod 1-segmented, with 6 setae. Maxillary syncoxa with 3 endites; endopod 2-segmented. Maxilliped stenopodial, with 1 stout element on basis distally; endopod small, 1-segmented, with 4 setae. P1 with 2-segmented exopod and endopod, P2–P4 with 3-segmented exopod and endopod; exp-3 with 2 outer spines. Female P5 exopod fused to baseoendopod basally, with deep incision between exopod and endopodal lobe; exopod with 3 marginal setae and 1 surface seta. P6 represented by 3 setae.</p>

            <p>Etymology</p>
            <p>
The generic name is a combination of the Greek ‘ 
heteros
’ (‘different’) and the name of the 
type
genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime</tp:taxon-name>
. This reflects the close relationship with 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime</tp:taxon-name>
, but recognizes the significant difference in the P1 exopod segmentation.

The species epithet reflects the Latin adjective ‘

’ (‘thin’ or ‘weak’), referring to the very small seta on the distal margin of P4 enp-3.

               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
on account of morphological features of the antenna, mouthpart appendages, P1 and P 
5 in
both sexes, which are identical with autapomorphies given by 
Seifried (2003)
. Significantly, this new species is morphologically similar to the 
typica
-group of 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime</tp:taxon-name>
, as defined by 

Kim 
et al
. (2016)

, on the basis of certain features such as the mandibular endopod with four setae; the maxillulary free endopod with six elements; the outer spines of the P1 exopod with gradually increasing outer spinules toward the distal end; the typical female P5 with a deep incision between the exopod and endopodal lobe and a well-developed cylindrical outer setophore; and the outermost seta of the P5 exopod displaced by a small peduncle toward the surface in both sexes. However, it is identified by a two-segmented exopod in the P1. All known zosimeid copepods exhibit constant P1 segmentation with a three-segmented exopod.
</p>
            <p>
The two-segmented exopod in P1 is not common within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Harpacticoida (
Moura &amp; Martínez Arbizu 2003

</tp:taxon-name>

A 
paratype
female specimen (
MABIK
CR00247791) exhibits two abnormal conditions in the P4 enp-1 and P5 exopod. The right leg of the P4 lacks an inner seta on the proximal endopodal segment (

, arrowhead) and the left leg of the P5 has four setae on the exopod (

, arrowhead). These setal abnormalities were not detected in other examined specimens.
</p>
            <p>Remarks</p>
            <p>
Interestingly, this new species exhibits several characteristics intermediate between those of the families 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
. Detailed morphological examination revealed that certain characteristics of the antenna and maxilliped resemble those of idyanthid copepods. The antenna of 
<tp:taxon-name>Acritozosime spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
shares the presence of two elements on the proximal exopodal segment with the idyanthid genera 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthe
Sars, 1909
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella
Sars, 1905

Lang, 1948
</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>NematovoraxBröhldick, 2005</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella
Sars, 1909
</tp:taxon-name>
(all known zosimeid copepods have only one seta); and the distal endopodal segment bears seven elements as in members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
(zosimeid species have at most six setae). The maxilliped of 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
resembles those of idyanthid copepods in the presence of a joint between the syncoxa and basis and the presence of two setae on the syncoxa (members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
have no setae on that segment, except for 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime eliasiPointner, 2017</tp:taxon-name>
having one seta). However, this new taxon also seems to have a close affinity with the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
as shown by the following features: (1) the female antennules are short, robust and armed with stout tri-spinulose setae; this is not the case in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
other than 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella</tp:taxon-name>
; (2) the distal endopodal segment of the antenna has a lateral armature composed of three elements (vs four setae in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (3) the mandibular endopod has only one lateral seta (vs 2–3 setae as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthe</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (4) the mandibular exopod is one-segmented, with four setae (vs two-segmented, with four setae on proximal segment and two setae on the distal one as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Styracothorax</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (5) the maxillular exopod is smaller than the endopod (vs longer than the endopod as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyellopsis</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (6) all endites on the maxillary syncoxa are displaced toward the anterior half (vs the praecoxal endite is displaced toward the proximal half as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (7) the maxilliped has a small and almost square endopod bearing four non-geniculate elements (vs with geniculate setae or strong claws as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthe</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Meteorina</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Styracothorax</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (8) the P1 enp-1 is almost square (vs elongate and broadened at the level of the inner element in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); and (9) the shape of the female P5 is similar to that of 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime bathybia
Bodin, 1968
</tp:taxon-name>
, although the number of setae on the exopod differs.
</p>
            <p>Seifried (2003)
listed four significant autapomorphies of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
: (1) the mandibular exopod has a long proximal segment bearing four setae and a small distal segment bearing two setae; (2) the maxillulary exopod is elongate; (3) the P1 enp-1 is elongated and broadened at the level of the inner seta; and (4) the proximal outer seta on the female P5 exopod is inserted near the basis. 
<tp:taxon-name>Acritozosime spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
does not share these characteristics. Instead, this new species exhibits several autapomorphies of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
in the antennary endopod, mandibular both rami, maxillulary exopod, maxillary syncoxa, maxillipedal endopod and P1 endopod as mentioned above (characters 
2–8 in
the previous paragraph). Therefore, we suggest that an allocation of 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
is more reasonable; the organism retains certain plesiomorphic conditions (at least in the antenna and maxilliped) of Idyanthidimorpha, as noted above. Within the Idyanthidimorpha, the sexual dimorphism of the male P2 is a clue to the taxonomic position of the harpacticoids (Moura &amp; Martínez Arbizu 2004; 
Bröhldick 2005
). Unfortunately, we could not confirm this character state because we lacked males of the new species.
</p>
            <p>
Within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
, the most conspicuous characters of 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
are the reduced segmentation and setal armature of the thoracic legs. The new species shares the two-segmented endopod in the thoracic legs with 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudozosime</tp:taxon-name>
, but differs from it by the reduced setal armature; the inner element of the proximal endopodal segment is lost in P1–P3; the distal exopodal segment in P2–P4 has two outer spines instead of three. All zosimeid copepods have one or two inner setae on the distal endopodal segment of P1, while these are lacking in 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
            </p>
            <p>
This new species is also characterized by the following unambiguous features: (1) the loss of abexopodal elements on the proximal endopodal segment of the antenna (present in other zosimeid genera); (2) the lack of an epipodal element on the coxa of the maxillule (present in other zosimeid genera); and (3) the caudal seta 
V
is notably elongated, being at least 80% of the total body length.

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="etymology">
            <p>Etymology</p>
            <p>
The generic name is a combination of the Greek ‘ 
heteros
’ (‘different’) and the name of the 
type
genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime</tp:taxon-name>
. This reflects the close relationship with 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime</tp:taxon-name>
, but recognizes the significant difference in the P1 exopod segmentation.

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="etymology">
            <p>Etymology</p>
            <p>
The species epithet reflects the Latin adjective ‘ 
<tp:taxon-name>tenuis</tp:taxon-name>
’ (‘thin’ or ‘weak’), referring to the very small seta on the distal margin of P4 enp-3.

There is no doubt in allocating

               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
on account of morphological features of the antenna, mouthpart appendages, P1 and P 
5 in
both sexes, which are identical with autapomorphies given by 
Seifried (2003)
. Significantly, this new species is morphologically similar to the 
typica
-group of 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime</tp:taxon-name>
, as defined by 

Kim 
et al
. (2016)

, on the basis of certain features such as the mandibular endopod with four setae; the maxillulary free endopod with six elements; the outer spines of the P1 exopod with gradually increasing outer spinules toward the distal end; the typical female P5 with a deep incision between the exopod and endopodal lobe and a well-developed cylindrical outer setophore; and the outermost seta of the P5 exopod displaced by a small peduncle toward the surface in both sexes. However, it is identified by a two-segmented exopod in the P1. All known zosimeid copepods exhibit constant P1 segmentation with a three-segmented exopod.
</p>
            <p>
The two-segmented exopod in P1 is not common within the

shares the presence of two elements on the proximal exopodal segment with the idyanthid genera 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthe
Sars, 1909
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella

and 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella

</tp:taxon-name>
(all known zosimeid copepods have only one seta); and the distal endopodal segment bears seven elements as in members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
(zosimeid species have at most six setae). The maxilliped of 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
resembles those of idyanthid copepods in the presence of a joint between the syncoxa and basis and the presence of two setae on the syncoxa (members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
have no setae on that segment, except for 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime eliasiPointner, 2017</tp:taxon-name>
having one seta). However, this new taxon also seems to have a close affinity with the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
as shown by the following features: (1) the female antennules are short, robust and armed with stout tri-spinulose setae; this is not the case in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
other than 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella</tp:taxon-name>
; (2) the distal endopodal segment of the antenna has a lateral armature composed of three elements (vs four setae in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (3) the mandibular endopod has only one lateral seta (vs 2–3 setae as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthe</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (4) the mandibular exopod is one-segmented, with four setae (vs two-segmented, with four setae on proximal segment and two setae on the distal one as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Styracothorax</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (5) the maxillular exopod is smaller than the endopod (vs longer than the endopod as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyellopsis</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (6) all endites on the maxillary syncoxa are displaced toward the anterior half (vs the praecoxal endite is displaced toward the proximal half as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (7) the maxilliped has a small and almost square endopod bearing four non-geniculate elements (vs with geniculate setae or strong claws as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthe</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Meteorina</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Styracothorax</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (8) the P1 enp-1 is almost square (vs elongate and broadened at the level of the inner element in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); and (9) the shape of the female P5 is similar to that of 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime bathybia
Bodin, 1968
</tp:taxon-name>
, although the number of setae on the exopod differs.
</p>
            <p>Seifried (2003)
listed four significant autapomorphies of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
: (1) the mandibular exopod has a long proximal segment bearing four setae and a small distal segment bearing two setae; (2) the maxillulary exopod is elongate; (3) the P1 enp-1 is elongated and broadened at the level of the inner seta; and (4) the proximal outer seta on the female P5 exopod is inserted near the basis. 
<tp:taxon-name>Acritozosime spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
does not share these characteristics. Instead, this new species exhibits several autapomorphies of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
in the antennary endopod, mandibular both rami, maxillulary exopod, maxillary syncoxa, maxillipedal endopod and P1 endopod as mentioned above (characters 
2–8 in
the previous paragraph). Therefore, we suggest that an allocation of 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
is more reasonable; the organism retains certain plesiomorphic conditions (at least in the antenna and maxilliped) of Idyanthidimorpha, as noted above. Within the Idyanthidimorpha, the sexual dimorphism of the male P2 is a clue to the taxonomic position of the harpacticoids (Moura &amp; Martínez Arbizu 2004; 
Bröhldick 2005
). Unfortunately, we could not confirm this character state because we lacked males of the new species.
</p>
            <p>
Within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
, the most conspicuous characters of 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
are the reduced segmentation and setal armature of the thoracic legs. The new species shares the two-segmented endopod in the thoracic legs with 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudozosime</tp:taxon-name>
, but differs from it by the reduced setal armature; the inner element of the proximal endopodal segment is lost in P1–P3; the distal exopodal segment in P2–P4 has two outer spines instead of three. All zosimeid copepods have one or two inner setae on the distal endopodal segment of P1, while these are lacking in 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
            </p>
            <p>
This new species is also characterized by the following unambiguous features: (1) the loss of abexopodal elements on the proximal endopodal segment of the antenna (present in other zosimeid genera); (2) the lack of an epipodal element on the coxa of the maxillule (present in other zosimeid genera); and (3) the caudal seta 
V
is notably elongated, being at least 80% of the total body length.

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="etymology">
            <p>Etymology</p>
            <p>
The generic name is a combination of the Greek ‘ 
heteros
’ (‘different’) and the name of the 
type
genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime</tp:taxon-name>
. This reflects the close relationship with 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime</tp:taxon-name>
, but recognizes the significant difference in the P1 exopod segmentation.

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="etymology">
            <p>Etymology</p>
            <p>
The species epithet reflects the Latin adjective ‘ 
<tp:taxon-name>tenuis</tp:taxon-name>
’ (‘thin’ or ‘weak’), referring to the very small seta on the distal margin of P4 enp-3.

on account of morphological features of the antenna, mouthpart appendages, P1 and P 
5 in
both sexes, which are identical with autapomorphies given by

typica
-group of 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime</tp:taxon-name>
, as defined by 

Kim 
et al
. (2016)

, on the basis of certain features such as the mandibular endopod with four setae; the maxillulary free endopod with six elements; the outer spines of the P1 exopod with gradually increasing outer spinules toward the distal end; the typical female P5 with a deep incision between the exopod and endopodal lobe and a well-developed cylindrical outer setophore; and the outermost seta of the P5 exopod displaced by a small peduncle toward the surface in both sexes. However, it is identified by a two-segmented exopod in the P1. All known zosimeid copepods exhibit constant P1 segmentation with a three-segmented exopod.
</p>
            <p>
The two-segmented exopod in P1 is not common within the

A 
paratype
female specimen (
MABIK
CR00247791) exhibits two abnormal conditions in the P4 enp-1 and P5 exopod. The right leg of the P4 lacks an inner seta on the proximal endopodal segment (

            <p>Remarks</p>
            <p>
Interestingly, this new species exhibits several characteristics intermediate between those of the families 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
. Detailed morphological examination revealed that certain characteristics of the antenna and maxilliped resemble those of idyanthid copepods. The antenna of 
<tp:taxon-name>Acritozosime spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
shares the presence of two elements on the proximal exopodal segment with the idyanthid genera 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthe

</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella

and 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella
Sars, 1909
</tp:taxon-name>
(all known zosimeid copepods have only one seta); and the distal endopodal segment bears seven elements as in members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
(zosimeid species have at most six setae). The maxilliped of 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
resembles those of idyanthid copepods in the presence of a joint between the syncoxa and basis and the presence of two setae on the syncoxa (members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
have no setae on that segment, except for 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime eliasiPointner, 2017</tp:taxon-name>
having one seta). However, this new taxon also seems to have a close affinity with the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
as shown by the following features: (1) the female antennules are short, robust and armed with stout tri-spinulose setae; this is not the case in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
other than 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella</tp:taxon-name>
; (2) the distal endopodal segment of the antenna has a lateral armature composed of three elements (vs four setae in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (3) the mandibular endopod has only one lateral seta (vs 2–3 setae as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthe</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (4) the mandibular exopod is one-segmented, with four setae (vs two-segmented, with four setae on proximal segment and two setae on the distal one as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Styracothorax</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Tachidiella</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (5) the maxillular exopod is smaller than the endopod (vs longer than the endopod as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyellopsis</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (6) all endites on the maxillary syncoxa are displaced toward the anterior half (vs the praecoxal endite is displaced toward the proximal half as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (7) the maxilliped has a small and almost square endopod bearing four non-geniculate elements (vs with geniculate setae or strong claws as in 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthe</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyella</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Meteorina</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Styracothorax</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (8) the P1 enp-1 is almost square (vs elongate and broadened at the level of the inner element in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); and (9) the shape of the female P5 is similar to that of 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime bathybia
Bodin, 1968
</tp:taxon-name>
, although the number of setae on the exopod differs.
</p>
            <p>Seifried (2003)
listed four significant autapomorphies of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
: (1) the mandibular exopod has a long proximal segment bearing four setae and a small distal segment bearing two setae; (2) the maxillulary exopod is elongate; (3) the P1 enp-1 is elongated and broadened at the level of the inner seta; and (4) the proximal outer seta on the female P5 exopod is inserted near the basis. 
<tp:taxon-name>Acritozosime spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
does not share these characteristics. Instead, this new species exhibits several autapomorphies of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
in the antennary endopod, mandibular both rami, maxillulary exopod, maxillary syncoxa, maxillipedal endopod and P1 endopod as mentioned above (characters 
2–8 in
the previous paragraph). Therefore, we suggest that an allocation of 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
is more reasonable; the organism retains certain plesiomorphic conditions (at least in the antenna and maxilliped) of Idyanthidimorpha, as noted above. Within the Idyanthidimorpha, the sexual dimorphism of the male P2 is a clue to the taxonomic position of the harpacticoids (Moura &amp; Martínez Arbizu 2004; 
Bröhldick 2005
). Unfortunately, we could not confirm this character state because we lacked males of the new species.
</p>
            <p>
Within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
are the reduced segmentation and setal armature of the thoracic legs. The new species shares the two-segmented endopod in the thoracic legs with 
<tp:taxon-name>Pseudozosime</tp:taxon-name>
, but differs from it by the reduced setal armature; the inner element of the proximal endopodal segment is lost in P1–P3; the distal exopodal segment in P2–P4 has two outer spines instead of three. All zosimeid copepods have one or two inner setae on the distal endopodal segment of P1, while these are lacking in 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
            </p>
            <p>
This new species is also characterized by the following unambiguous features: (1) the loss of abexopodal elements on the proximal endopodal segment of the antenna (present in other zosimeid genera); (2) the lack of an epipodal element on the coxa of the maxillule (present in other zosimeid genera); and (3) the caudal seta 
V
is notably elongated, being at least 80% of the total body length.

Within the family

and 
<tp:taxon-name>Acritozosime</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
, share a robust characteristic of the P1 exopod. In both genera, this ramus consists of only two segments, which is unique to the family and can be regarded as autapomorphies for both genera, supporting the establishment of two genera for 
<tp:taxon-name>H
.

<tp:taxon-name>H

discussed the development of copepodids in 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosime pacificaFiers, 1991</tp:taxon-name>
; this species has a three-segmented P1 exopod as do other zosimeid copepods. During ontogeny, the middle and distal segments of the P1 exopod separated during the transition from copepodid IV stage to 
V
(see 
Fiers 1991
: table II); consequently, the ramus setations were rearranged from 0.223 to 0.1.123. In the case of 
<tp:taxon-name>H
. 
tenuis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
, the adult female armature is similar to that of copepodid IV of 
<tp:taxon-name>Z
. 
pacifica</tp:taxon-name>
, with two inner setae the distal segment. A comparison of the setal positions on the ramus reveals that the two inner setae on the distal segment are homologous to those of 
<tp:taxon-name>Z
. 
pacifica</tp:taxon-name>
, indicating that the two-segmented P1 exopod of 
<tp:taxon-name>H
. 
tenuis</tp:taxon-name>
gen. et nov. is probably derived by suppression of middle/distal exopodal segment separation in copepodid IV. In contrast, the distal segment of this ramus in the adult female of 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
has only one (not two) inner seta(e) proximally. The absence of a distal inner element suggests that either the original third segment of 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
had no inner elements or that a seta has been secondarily lost during ontogeny. This seta is present in all other zosimeid copepods. Thus, it seems that 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
has undergone an evolutionary history that differs from those of other genera. This suggestion is supported by the several unambiguous autapomorphies (the absence of an epipodal element on the maxillular coxa and the absence of inner setae on the P2–P3 enp-1), and retention of certain plesiomorphic states (the antennary exopod features two setae on the proximal segment and the maxillipedal syncoxa contains two elements (see our remarks above on 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
)). As plesiomorphic features of the Idyanthidimorpha are evident in the antenna and maxilliped, this deep-sea species seems to occupy a ground position within the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>Bröhldick (2005)
established the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Nematovorax</tp:taxon-name>
for 
<tp:taxon-name>N
. 
gebkelinaeBröhldick, 2005</tp:taxon-name>
from the deep 
Angola
Basin in the South Atlantic and placed it in the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
. She recognized that the new taxon exhibited several characteristics of both the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
, rendering it difficult to derive its exact taxonomic position within the Idyanthidimorpha. For example, the P1 endopod is twosegmented as in members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
, but the sexual dimorphism of the P2 endopod is identical to that of idyanthid copepods lacking the inner elements of the male P2 enp-3 (
Bröhldick 2005
). Given that three important apomorphies (in the P1 enp-1, P5 exopod and male P2 enp-3) are shared with the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Idyanthidae, 
Bröhldick (2005)</tp:taxon-name>
allocated 
<tp:taxon-name>Nematovorax</tp:taxon-name>
to that taxon. 
Bröhldick (2005)
also examined many undescribed species (e.g., 
<tp:taxon-name>Nematovorax
sp. 1
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Nematovorax
sp. 2
</tp:taxon-name>
) from DIVA 1 samples (obtained in the study area yielding the new 
<tp:taxon-name>Nematovorax</tp:taxon-name>
species); these retained many plesiomorphic conditions (as did 
<tp:taxon-name>N
. 
gebkelinae</tp:taxon-name>
), suggesting that they might be a sister-group of the Idyantidae– 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
. However, 
Bröhldick (2005)
hesitated to erect a new family for 
<tp:taxon-name>N
. 
gebkelinae</tp:taxon-name>
given the absence of certain familial autapomorphies of these taxa. The morphology of female 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
from the northwestern Pacific resembles that of 
<tp:taxon-name>N
. 
gebkelinae</tp:taxon-name>
as follows: (1) the female antennule is short and robust; (2) the proximal exopodal segment of the antenna features two lateral setae; (3) the distal armature of the distal endopodal segment of the antenna consists of seven elements; (4) the armature of the mandibular endopod features one lateral and four distal setae; (5) the maxilliped is jointed between the syncoxa and basis and the syncoxa has two elements; and (6) the single genital slit has one long seta and two minute setae on both sides. We suggest that these morphological similarities may imply that Bröhldick’s assumption is correct; alternatively, convergence may be in play. Nevertheless, using the current taxonomic criteria, we place 
<tp:taxon-name>A
. 
spinesco</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. et sp. nov.</named-content>
in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
based on the absence of the four apomorphies of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
, pending the discovery of many undescribed species related to 
<tp:taxon-name>Nematovorax</tp:taxon-name>
or

            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">gen. nov.</named-content>
