            <tp:taxon-name>Litoria graminea</tp:taxon-name>
is a large green canopy­dwelling frog originally described from a single specimen from an unknown locality in 
Papua New Guinea
. We demonstrate that this species as currently recognised contains at least three distinct taxa. We restrict the name 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
to a population of animals occurring south of New Guinea’s main cordillera and describe two new species of large green arboreal frogs, one from the Kikori River Basin (Southern Highlands and Gulf Province) and one from the Huon Peninsula (Morobe Province). The two new species can be distinguished from each other by differences in iris and sclera colouration, and both can be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>L
. 
graminea</tp:taxon-name>
by their narrower heads, different iris colouration and by their small round (vs elongate) nuptial pads.

Until recently only two species of very large (&gt; 
60 mm
), green and slender arboreal 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>L. infrafrenata</tp:taxon-name>
,

were known from lowland and foothill rainforests of New 
Guinea
. 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria infrafrenata</tp:taxon-name>
is comparatively well known and widely collected because it frequently occurs in close association with humans (

Tyler 
1968
, 

Menzies 
1976
). In contrast 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
is rarely encountered and only a small number of specimens have been collected since its description by 

Boulenger (
1905
)

(

Parker 
1936
, 

Tyler 
1968
, 

Allison 
et al
. 
1998
, 

Richards 
2002
). The rarity of these animals is attributable to their canopydwelling habits. The only other large, uniformly green 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
in lowland New 
Guinea
is 
<tp:taxon-name>L. caerulea</tp:taxon-name>
, a robust species with distinct parotid glands that is found in drier forest habitats of southern and northern New 
Guinea
(

Tyler 
1968
).
</p>
         <p>
Over the last ten years the senior author has collected a number of specimens provisionally referred to 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria graminea</tp:taxon-name>
from widely scattered localities north and south of New Guinea’s central cordillera. Although similar in morphology and vocalisation, consistent differences among populations in iris colouration, eyelid pigmentation and a number of morphological features demonstrate that more than one species is included in these collections (

Richards 
et al
. 
2006
). Here we restrict the name 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria graminea</tp:taxon-name>
to a species of large green 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
occuring south of the central mountains that has a broad head and no pigmentation on the nictitating membrane. We also describe two new species, one from the southern and one from the northern lowlands of 
Papua New Guinea
.

The specimens examined in this study are deposited in the Museum of Natural History London (
BMNH
), the South Australian Museum, Adelaide (
SAMA
), and the Natural Sciences Resource Centre of the University of 
Papua New Guinea
(
UPNG
). Specimens were fixed in 
10
% formalin and stored in 
70
% alcohol. For some specimens tissue samples were taken and stored in 
70
% alcohol. Measurements (to the nearest 
0.1 mm
) were taken with dial calipers and a stereomicroscope fitted with an ocular micrometer, and follow

         <p>
Advertisement calls were recorded with a Sony Pro­Walkman WMD­ 
6
C tape recorder and Sennheiser ME 
66
microphone, and calls were analyzed using the AVISOFT SAS­Lab 
Pro
sound analysis program. Temperatures at about 
2 m
above ground were measured with a Miller &amp; Weber quick­reading thermometer. Members of this complex of frogs call from high (usually&gt; 
20 m
) above the forest floor, and recordings are generally faint and of insufficient quality for detailed analysis. We incorporate call data here only to provide a general indication of vocalization structure.

         <title>Diagnosis of the<tp:taxon-name>Litoria graminea</tp:taxon-name>complex</title>
         <p>
The combination of large size (adult males over 
60 mm
), and uniform bright green dorsal colouration (blue in preservative) serves to separate members of what is herein defined as the 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria graminea</tp:taxon-name>
complex from all other described New Guinean 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
except 
<tp:taxon-name>L. caerulea</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>L. hunti</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>L. infrafrenata</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>L. sanguinolenta</tp:taxon-name>
. From these taxa the 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
complex can be distinguished by the combination of fully webbed hands, absence of prominent and enlarged parotoid glands, absence of a white labial stripe, SVL not over 
85 mm
and call consisting of a single, relatively short (

0.206­ 
0.379
s) grunt with an unusual clumped pattern of pulses.
</p>
         <p>
The large species with which there is potential for confusion can be further distinguished by the following characters: 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria caerulea</tp:taxon-name>
lacks white dermal folds on the arms and legs, possesses prominent parotoid glands above the head and has much less extensively webbed fingers. The recently described 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria hunti</tp:taxon-name>
is slightly smaller, has a white labial stripe and has a characteristically longer call (

0.69­ 
0.9
s) (

Richards 
et al
. 
2006
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria infrafrenata</tp:taxon-name>
can be differentiated by its significantly larger size (females to 
135 mm
; 

Menzies 
1976
; pers obs), its distinctive white labial stripe that invariably extends beyond the tympanum, its half­webbed fingers, and its advertisement call consisting of double notes (
De
la 

Riva 
et al
. 
2004
). The only other species that superficially resembles members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria graminea</tp:taxon-name>
complex is 
<tp:taxon-name>L. sanguinolenta</tp:taxon-name>
.

That species is smaller (SVL 40.0­55.0mm), and has only half­webbed hands. It is important to note that the 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria graminea</tp:taxon-name>
complex as defined here may not represent a monophyletic evolutionary unit. Rather, it is a group of morphologically similar species that conform with the original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
. All further comparisons and diagnoses presented in this paper will be confined to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria graminea</tp:taxon-name>
complex.
</p>
         <p>Advertisement call</p>
         <p>
The call of all members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria graminea</tp:taxon-name>
complex documented to date is a single, guttural grunt uttered at approximately 
7­30
s intervals. A consistent feature of these calls is that pulses are not evenly distributed throughout a call but are clumped, a feature also apparent in 
<tp:taxon-name>L. hunti
(

Richards 
et al
. 
2006
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. The paucity of call data and the generally poor quality of recordings due to the canopy­dwelling habits of these frogs reduces their usefulness for delineating species boundaries within the 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
complex. Call data for true 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
and the two new taxa described in this paper are presented in 

Table 
1
. Single calls of the two new taxa are also illustrated in Fig. 
9
. The quality of 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
recordings are of insufficient quality for graphical representation.

The 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria graminea</tp:taxon-name>
(
BMNH
1947.2.23.31) (

) is a moderately large treefrog (SVL 
49.7 mm
) that was described by Boulenger in 
1905
. Despite its large size the specimen appears to be a juvenile and Boulenger did not report a gender for the specimen. It lacks nuptial pads and the mouth is closed so it has not been possible to determine the presence of vocal slits. Precise details of the 
type
locality are unknown. The specimen was collected from ‘Northern British New Guinea’, an area in the centre of what is now 
Papua New Guinea
.
</p>
            <p>
Recent collections of 
L. ‘graminea’
from widely scattered sites across New 
Guinea
have necessitated a reassessment of the status of this species. Consistent differences in iris colour pattern, relative head width, and nuptial pad shape among populations demonstrate that at least three species are included within 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
as currently recognized. We here restrict the name 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
to a species of large green 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
that occurs south of New Guinea’s central mountains and has a broad head, fully webbed fingers and pigmentation on the nictitating membrane that is restricted to a thin band of tiny spots along the dorsalmost edge of the membrane. We nominate this southern taxon as ‘true’ 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
because the 
holotype
is from southern 
Papua New Guinea
(British New 
Guinea
) and it resembles that taxon alone in the combination of broad head (HW/SVL 
0.404
), sparse pigmentation on the nictitating membrane, and possession of a thin white stripe along the distal edge of the dorsal eyelid.

            <p>Description</p>
            <p>
A large green 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
(an adult male 73.0 mm) with fully webbed fingers. These two specimens are associated on the basis of their broad heads (HW/SVL ratios of 
0.404
(
holotype
) and 
0.379
(
SAMA
R 
55521
), above the range of variation reported for two new species described below). Both specimens also share a prominent white stripe along the upper eyelid, a character that distinguishes 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
from members of this complex found north of the main cordillera, but not from the new taxon described below from south of the cordillera. Pigmentation on the nictitating membrane of the Lakekamu specimen is restricted to a thin band of speckling along the upper edge; the nictitating membrane is not clearly visible in the 
holotype
.
</p>
            <p>
In preservative the 
holotype
and the Lakekamu specimen are very similar in appearance. Both specimens are a dull greyish­blue dorsally, the ventral surfaces are yellowish (
holotype
) or cream (
SAMA
R 
55521
). Prominent white dermal ridges are apparent on the postero­lateral edges of the legs and arms of both animals.
</p>
            <p>
Boulenger (
1905
)

did not provide a description of 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
in life. Photographs of the Lakekamu specimen (

) show it to be uniform bright green on most dorsal surfaces including the legs, with the exceptions of a thin orange area on the uppermost portion of the forelimbs, and a thin but distinctive white stripe along the outer edge of the upper eyelid. The dorsal surfaces of digital disks are dull yellowish green and the finger and toe webbing is purple with extensive orange markings, especially towards the distal edges. Dorso­lateral surfaces are green, tending towards reddish orange interspersed with patches of green or cream midlaterally and ventrally. Ventral surfaces are largely cream with a distinctive purple patch around the upper third of the arm and posterior edge of throat. Photographs taken during the day and night indicate that colouration is considerably more intense at night, however the overall colour pattern remains unchanged. The pupil is horizontal, the iris is coarsely mottled with approximately equal amounts of black and brownish orange; the sclera is bright blue.
</p>
            <p>
Assignment of the Lakekamu specimen to 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
provides several potentially diagnostic characters for the species, namely: iris coarsely mottled with black and orange; a blue sclera; extensive orange pigmentation on the ventro­lateral surfaces of the body, and distinctive elongate nuptial pads that extend nearly halfway up the proximal edge of finger I. The Lakekamu specimen is also the largest male 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
complex animal examined, suggesting that this species may be slightly larger than the other two taxa described herein. The single Lakekamu specimen was collected while calling in primary rainforest five metres above the ground. Numerous other individuals were heard calling from high (&gt; 
20 m
) in the canopy throughout the duration of a survey at Lakekamu (

There is little variation in size or ratios among the 
type
series (

Table

). The 
paratypes
differ from the 
holotype
in having a largely uniform (Vs mottled) pale slate blue dorsal colouration in preservative, although 
SAMA
R 
57868
does have a very small amount of darker blue pigmentation in scattered and random spots across the dorsum and limbs. In life specimens from Dark 
End
Lumber have a purplish­blue ventral colouration that contrasts significantly with yellow ventral colour of the 
holotype
. This purplish blue extends to the dorsal surface of the pads, inner digits and webbing. In all other respects the colouration of the 
paratypes
and the 
holotype
in life is identical, and no difference in ventral colouration is apparent in preservative. The smallest specimen (
SAMA
R 
57868
) lacks pigmented nuptial pads, but does have vocal slits, suggesting it is mature or very nearly so.

One specimen was in a tree adjacent to a forest garden and two specimens were collected from primary rainforest in trees overhanging puddles that had formed in a previously dry rocky creek bed after torrential rain. One male descended to within three metres of the pools during observation, suggesting that this species may breed in pools on the forest floor. Descending to the ground after torrential rain to breed is a behaviour typical of several groups of unrelated tropical arboreal frogs e.g

The 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria graminea</tp:taxon-name>
(
BMNH
1947.2.23.31) (

) is a moderately large treefrog (SVL 
49.7 mm
) that was described by Boulenger in 
1905
. Despite its large size the specimen appears to be a juvenile and Boulenger did not report a gender for the specimen. It lacks nuptial pads and the mouth is closed so it has not been possible to determine the presence of vocal slits. Precise details of the 
type
locality are unknown. The specimen was collected from ‘Northern British New Guinea’, an area in the centre of what is now 
Papua New Guinea
.
</p>
            <p>
Recent collections of 
L. ‘graminea’
from widely scattered sites across New 
Guinea
have necessitated a reassessment of the status of this species. Consistent differences in iris colour pattern, relative head width, and nuptial pad shape among populations demonstrate that at least three species are included within 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
as currently recognized. We here restrict the name 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
to a species of large green 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
that occurs south of New Guinea’s central mountains and has a broad head, fully webbed fingers and pigmentation on the nictitating membrane that is restricted to a thin band of tiny spots along the dorsalmost edge of the membrane. We nominate this southern taxon as ‘true’ 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
because the 
holotype
is from southern 
Papua New Guinea
(British New 
Guinea
) and it resembles that taxon alone in the combination of broad head (HW/SVL 
0.404
), sparse pigmentation on the nictitating membrane, and possession of a thin white stripe along the distal edge of the dorsal eyelid.

            <p>
A large green 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
(an adult male 73.0 mm) with fully webbed fingers. These two specimens are associated on the basis of their broad heads (HW/SVL ratios of 
0.404
(
holotype
) and 
0.379
(
SAMA
R 
55521
), above the range of variation reported for two new species described below). Both specimens also share a prominent white stripe along the upper eyelid, a character that distinguishes 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
from members of this complex found north of the main cordillera, but not from the new taxon described below from south of the cordillera. Pigmentation on the nictitating membrane of the Lakekamu specimen is restricted to a thin band of speckling along the upper edge; the nictitating membrane is not clearly visible in the 
holotype
.
</p>
            <p>
In preservative the 
holotype
and the Lakekamu specimen are very similar in appearance. Both specimens are a dull greyish­blue dorsally, the ventral surfaces are yellowish (
holotype
) or cream (
SAMA
R 
55521
). Prominent white dermal ridges are apparent on the postero­lateral edges of the legs and arms of both animals.
</p>
            <p>
Boulenger (
1905
)

did not provide a description of 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
in life. Photographs of the Lakekamu specimen (

) show it to be uniform bright green on most dorsal surfaces including the legs, with the exceptions of a thin orange area on the uppermost portion of the forelimbs, and a thin but distinctive white stripe along the outer edge of the upper eyelid. The dorsal surfaces of digital disks are dull yellowish green and the finger and toe webbing is purple with extensive orange markings, especially towards the distal edges. Dorso­lateral surfaces are green, tending towards reddish orange interspersed with patches of green or cream midlaterally and ventrally. Ventral surfaces are largely cream with a distinctive purple patch around the upper third of the arm and posterior edge of throat. Photographs taken during the day and night indicate that colouration is considerably more intense at night, however the overall colour pattern remains unchanged. The pupil is horizontal, the iris is coarsely mottled with approximately equal amounts of black and brownish orange; the sclera is bright blue.
</p>
            <p>
Assignment of the Lakekamu specimen to 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
provides several potentially diagnostic characters for the species, namely: iris coarsely mottled with black and orange; a blue sclera; extensive orange pigmentation on the ventro­lateral surfaces of the body, and distinctive elongate nuptial pads that extend nearly halfway up the proximal edge of finger I. The Lakekamu specimen is also the largest male 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
complex animal examined, suggesting that this species may be slightly larger than the other two taxa described herein. The single Lakekamu specimen was collected while calling in primary rainforest five metres above the ground. Numerous other individuals were heard calling from high (&gt; 
20 m
) in the canopy throughout the duration of a survey at Lakekamu (

            <p>
There is little variation in size or ratios among the 
type
series (

Table 
1
). The 
paratypes
differ from the 
holotype
in having a largely uniform (Vs mottled) pale slate blue dorsal colouration in preservative, although 
SAMA
R 
57868
does have a very small amount of darker blue pigmentation in scattered and random spots across the dorsum and limbs. In life specimens from Dark 
End
Lumber have a purplish­blue ventral colouration that contrasts significantly with yellow ventral colour of the 
holotype
. This purplish blue extends to the dorsal surface of the pads, inner digits and webbing. In all other respects the colouration of the 
paratypes
and the 
holotype
in life is identical, and no difference in ventral colouration is apparent in preservative. The smallest specimen (
SAMA
R 
57868
) lacks pigmented nuptial pads, but does have vocal slits, suggesting it is mature or very nearly so.

The 
type
series is rather uniform. The male 
UPNG9986
is the smallest specimen and is significantly darker than the other 
types
, especially in the anterior dorsal region. The single female 
paratype
(
SAMA
R 
60726
) is the largest specimen (SVL 75.0 mm) but this size difference is not unusual for 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
species (e.g, 

Tyler

). Both 
paratypes
have slightly more brown spotting on the hands and feet than the

in the characters used to diagnose

<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
in having a narrower head (

<tp:taxon-name>L. sauroni</tp:taxon-name>
but differs notably in a number of characters related to eye colouration, including iris without extensive and heavy black and red pigmentation, sclera black (vs blue), and pigment flecking largely restricted to a band across the dorsal edge of the nictitating membrane (vs dense stippling across membrane). It can also be distinguished from both the species mentioned above by the absence of a white distal edge to the upper eyelid.

January 
2003
. One specimen was in a tree adjacent to a forest garden and two specimens were collected from primary rainforest in trees overhanging puddles that had formed in a previously dry rocky creek bed after torrential rain. One male descended to within three metres of the pools during observation, suggesting that this species may breed in pools on the forest floor. Descending to the ground after torrential rain to breed is a behaviour typical of several groups of unrelated tropical arboreal frogs e.g

The 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria graminea</tp:taxon-name>
(
BMNH
1947.2.23.31) (

) is a moderately large treefrog (SVL 
49.7 mm
) that was described by Boulenger in 
1905
. Despite its large size the specimen appears to be a juvenile and Boulenger did not report a gender for the specimen. It lacks nuptial pads and the mouth is closed so it has not been possible to determine the presence of vocal slits. Precise details of the 
type
locality are unknown. The specimen was collected from ‘Northern British New Guinea’, an area in the centre of what is now 
Papua New Guinea
.
</p>
            <p>
Recent collections of 
L. ‘graminea’
from widely scattered sites across New 
Guinea
have necessitated a reassessment of the status of this species. Consistent differences in iris colour pattern, relative head width, and nuptial pad shape among populations demonstrate that at least three species are included within 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
as currently recognized. We here restrict the name 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
to a species of large green 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
that occurs south of New Guinea’s central mountains and has a broad head, fully webbed fingers and pigmentation on the nictitating membrane that is restricted to a thin band of tiny spots along the dorsalmost edge of the membrane. We nominate this southern taxon as ‘true’ 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
because the 
holotype
is from southern 
Papua New Guinea
(British New 
Guinea
) and it resembles that taxon alone in the combination of broad head (HW/SVL 
0.404
), sparse pigmentation on the nictitating membrane, and possession of a thin white stripe along the distal edge of the dorsal eyelid.

            <p>Description</p>
            <p>
A large green 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
(an adult male 73.0 mm) with fully webbed fingers. These two specimens are associated on the basis of their broad heads (HW/SVL ratios of 
0.404
(
holotype
) and 
0.379
(
SAMA
R 
55521
), above the range of variation reported for two new species described below). Both specimens also share a prominent white stripe along the upper eyelid, a character that distinguishes 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
from members of this complex found north of the main cordillera, but not from the new taxon described below from south of the cordillera. Pigmentation on the nictitating membrane of the Lakekamu specimen is restricted to a thin band of speckling along the upper edge; the nictitating membrane is not clearly visible in the 
holotype
.
</p>
            <p>
In preservative the 
holotype
and the Lakekamu specimen are very similar in appearance. Both specimens are a dull greyish­blue dorsally, the ventral surfaces are yellowish (
holotype
) or cream (
SAMA
R 
55521
). Prominent white dermal ridges are apparent on the postero­lateral edges of the legs and arms of both animals.
</p>
            <p>
Boulenger (
1905
)

did not provide a description of 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
in life. Photographs of the Lakekamu specimen (

) show it to be uniform bright green on most dorsal surfaces including the legs, with the exceptions of a thin orange area on the uppermost portion of the forelimbs, and a thin but distinctive white stripe along the outer edge of the upper eyelid. The dorsal surfaces of digital disks are dull yellowish green and the finger and toe webbing is purple with extensive orange markings, especially towards the distal edges. Dorso­lateral surfaces are green, tending towards reddish orange interspersed with patches of green or cream midlaterally and ventrally. Ventral surfaces are largely cream with a distinctive purple patch around the upper third of the arm and posterior edge of throat. Photographs taken during the day and night indicate that colouration is considerably more intense at night, however the overall colour pattern remains unchanged. The pupil is horizontal, the iris is coarsely mottled with approximately equal amounts of black and brownish orange; the sclera is bright blue.
</p>
            <p>
Assignment of the Lakekamu specimen to 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
provides several potentially diagnostic characters for the species, namely: iris coarsely mottled with black and orange; a blue sclera; extensive orange pigmentation on the ventro­lateral surfaces of the body, and distinctive elongate nuptial pads that extend nearly halfway up the proximal edge of finger I. The Lakekamu specimen is also the largest male 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
complex animal examined, suggesting that this species may be slightly larger than the other two taxa described herein. The single Lakekamu specimen was collected while calling in primary rainforest five metres above the ground. Numerous other individuals were heard calling from high (&gt; 
20 m
) in the canopy throughout the duration of a survey at Lakekamu (

            <p>
There is little variation in size or ratios among the 
type
series (

Table 
1
). The 
paratypes
differ from the 
holotype
in having a largely uniform (Vs mottled) pale slate blue dorsal colouration in preservative, although 
SAMA
R 
57868
does have a very small amount of darker blue pigmentation in scattered and random spots across the dorsum and limbs. In life specimens from Dark 
End
Lumber have a purplish­blue ventral colouration that contrasts significantly with yellow ventral colour of the 
holotype
. This purplish blue extends to the dorsal surface of the pads, inner digits and webbing. In all other respects the colouration of the 
paratypes
and the 
holotype
in life is identical, and no difference in ventral colouration is apparent in preservative. The smallest specimen (
SAMA
R 
57868
) lacks pigmented nuptial pads, but does have vocal slits, suggesting it is mature or very nearly so.

0.046
), annulus distinct, dorsal edge obscured by thick, fleshy, curved supratympanic fold that runs from posterior edge of eye to axillary junction. In preservative skin on dorsal surfaces of body and limbs smooth; ventrally throat, forelimbs and most of hindlimbs smooth, abdomen and lateral edge of femur coarsely granular.
</p>
            <p>
Arms robust; prominent white dermal fold extends from penultimate phalanx of finger IV along upper arm to elbow; relative lengths of fingers III&gt;IV&gt;II&gt;I; terminal discs of all fingers significantly wider than penultimate phalanx (

), with circummarginal grooves; subarticular tubercles prominent, conical; two tubercles on digits I and II, three tubercles (medial tubercle distinctly larger) on digits III and IV; one rounded supranumerary tubercle on digit I, three or more on digits II to IV; a single large (one third length of digit I), ovoid inner metacarpal tubercle and a small rounded nuptial excresence at base of digit I. All digits webbed, webbing extends to level of proximal subarticular tubercle between digits I and II, and on both sides of digit III; and to disc on outer side of digit two and inner side of digit IV.
</p>
            <p>
Legs moderately long (TL/SVL = 
0.537
); prominent white dermal fold along tarsus extends from lateral edge of toe V to heel. Relative lengths of toes IV&gt;V&gt;III&gt;II&gt;

), subarticular tubercles prominent, rounded or conical, two tubercles on digits I and II, three on digits III and V, and four on digit IV; numerous small round supranumerary tubercles on basal phalanges of digits II­V; inner metatarsal tubercle small, oval shaped. All digits webbed, webbing extends halfway along penultimate phalanx on both sides of digit IV, and to base of disc on all other digits.
</p>
            <p>In life dorsum and dorsal surfaces of arms and legs pale leaf green with scattered faint patches of yellowish green. Ventral surfaces, including hidden surfaces of both limbs, yellow to yellowish white. Yellowish­green horseshoe shaped marking on the tympanic membrane. Dorsal surfaces of outer toes and fingers leaf green; of inner toes and webbing yellow. Prominent off­white dermal ridges on outer edge of arms and legs. Pupil horizontal, iris with distinctive outer red rim surrounding inner ring of grey around pupil, a further thin reddish line is present just above the pupil; sclera black.</p>
            <p>In preservative dorsal surfaces pale slate blue with widely scattered very small patches of darker slate blue; ventral surfaces off­white, abdomen with very slight brownish tinge. Dorsal surface of legs, lower arms, finger IV and toe V largely slate blue. Remaining digits largely white with varying levels of faint brown spotting, especially toe IV and finger III which appear faintly tinted with brown. Tympanic membrane with distinct area of clear skin in the shape of an inverted horseshoe. Dermal ridge on edge of legs and arms white. Nuptial excresence very faint brown.</p>

The 
type
series is rather uniform. The male 
UPNG9986
is the smallest specimen and is significantly darker than the other 
types
, especially in the anterior dorsal region. The single female 
paratype
(
SAMA
R 
60726
) is the largest specimen (SVL 75.0 mm) but this size difference is not unusual for 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
species (e.g, 

Tyler 
1968
). Both 
paratypes
have slightly more brown spotting on the hands and feet than the 
holotype
.

            <p>
               <tp:taxon-name>Litoria dux</tp:taxon-name>
differs from all New Guinean 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
except 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>L
. 
sauroni</tp:taxon-name>
in the characters used to diagnose 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
(above). It differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
in having a narrower head (
0.34
Vs 
0.38­0.40
), an iris without extensive black and orange reticulations and in having a small round (vs elongate) nuptial pad. It is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>L. sauroni</tp:taxon-name>
but differs notably in a number of characters related to eye colouration, including iris without extensive and heavy black and red pigmentation, sclera black (vs blue), and pigment flecking largely restricted to a band across the dorsal edge of the nictitating membrane (vs dense stippling across membrane). It can also be distinguished from both the species mentioned above by the absence of a white distal edge to the upper eyelid.

         <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="etymology">
            <p>Etymology</p>
            <p>
From the Latin 
<tp:taxon-name>dux</tp:taxon-name>
, meaning leader, alluding to the bright colouration and impressive appearance of the species (particularly the red iris) which make it prominent within a genus that is already replete with spectacular species.

were calling from high in the canopy on ridges adjacent to the Tarona River during 

January 
2003
. One specimen was in a tree adjacent to a forest garden and two specimens were collected from primary rainforest in trees overhanging puddles that had formed in a previously dry rocky creek bed after torrential rain. One male descended to within three metres of the pools during observation, suggesting that this species may breed in pools on the forest floor. Descending to the ground after torrential rain to breed is a behaviour typical of several groups of unrelated tropical arboreal frogs e.g

The 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria graminea</tp:taxon-name>
(
BMNH
1947.2.23.31) (

) is a moderately large treefrog (SVL 
49.7 mm
) that was described by Boulenger in 
1905
. Despite its large size the specimen appears to be a juvenile and Boulenger did not report a gender for the specimen. It lacks nuptial pads and the mouth is closed so it has not been possible to determine the presence of vocal slits. Precise details of the 
type
locality are unknown. The specimen was collected from ‘Northern British New Guinea’, an area in the centre of what is now 
Papua New Guinea
.
</p>
            <p>
Recent collections of 
L. ‘graminea’
from widely scattered sites across New 
Guinea
have necessitated a reassessment of the status of this species. Consistent differences in iris colour pattern, relative head width, and nuptial pad shape among populations demonstrate that at least three species are included within 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
as currently recognized. We here restrict the name 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
to a species of large green 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
that occurs south of New Guinea’s central mountains and has a broad head, fully webbed fingers and pigmentation on the nictitating membrane that is restricted to a thin band of tiny spots along the dorsalmost edge of the membrane. We nominate this southern taxon as ‘true’ 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
because the 
holotype
is from southern 
Papua New Guinea
(British New 
Guinea
) and it resembles that taxon alone in the combination of broad head (HW/SVL 
0.404
), sparse pigmentation on the nictitating membrane, and possession of a thin white stripe along the distal edge of the dorsal eyelid.

            <p>Description</p>
            <p>
A large green 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
(an adult male 73.0 mm) with fully webbed fingers. These two specimens are associated on the basis of their broad heads (HW/SVL ratios of 
0.404
(
holotype
) and 
0.379
(
SAMA
R 
55521
), above the range of variation reported for two new species described below). Both specimens also share a prominent white stripe along the upper eyelid, a character that distinguishes 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
from members of this complex found north of the main cordillera, but not from the new taxon described below from south of the cordillera. Pigmentation on the nictitating membrane of the Lakekamu specimen is restricted to a thin band of speckling along the upper edge; the nictitating membrane is not clearly visible in the 
holotype
.
</p>
            <p>
In preservative the 
holotype
and the Lakekamu specimen are very similar in appearance. Both specimens are a dull greyish­blue dorsally, the ventral surfaces are yellowish (
holotype
) or cream (
SAMA
R 
55521
). Prominent white dermal ridges are apparent on the postero­lateral edges of the legs and arms of both animals.
</p>
            <p>
Boulenger (
1905
)

did not provide a description of 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
in life. Photographs of the Lakekamu specimen (

) show it to be uniform bright green on most dorsal surfaces including the legs, with the exceptions of a thin orange area on the uppermost portion of the forelimbs, and a thin but distinctive white stripe along the outer edge of the upper eyelid. The dorsal surfaces of digital disks are dull yellowish green and the finger and toe webbing is purple with extensive orange markings, especially towards the distal edges. Dorso­lateral surfaces are green, tending towards reddish orange interspersed with patches of green or cream midlaterally and ventrally. Ventral surfaces are largely cream with a distinctive purple patch around the upper third of the arm and posterior edge of throat. Photographs taken during the day and night indicate that colouration is considerably more intense at night, however the overall colour pattern remains unchanged. The pupil is horizontal, the iris is coarsely mottled with approximately equal amounts of black and brownish orange; the sclera is bright blue.
</p>
            <p>
Assignment of the Lakekamu specimen to 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
provides several potentially diagnostic characters for the species, namely: iris coarsely mottled with black and orange; a blue sclera; extensive orange pigmentation on the ventro­lateral surfaces of the body, and distinctive elongate nuptial pads that extend nearly halfway up the proximal edge of finger I. The Lakekamu specimen is also the largest male 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
complex animal examined, suggesting that this species may be slightly larger than the other two taxa described herein. The single Lakekamu specimen was collected while calling in primary rainforest five metres above the ground. Numerous other individuals were heard calling from high (&gt; 
20 m
) in the canopy throughout the duration of a survey at Lakekamu (

There is little variation in size or ratios among the 
type
series (

Table

). The 
paratypes
differ from the 
holotype
in having a largely uniform (Vs mottled) pale slate blue dorsal colouration in preservative, although 
SAMA
R 
57868
does have a very small amount of darker blue pigmentation in scattered and random spots across the dorsum and limbs. In life specimens from Dark 
End
Lumber have a purplish­blue ventral colouration that contrasts significantly with yellow ventral colour of the 
holotype
. This purplish blue extends to the dorsal surface of the pads, inner digits and webbing. In all other respects the colouration of the 
paratypes
and the 
holotype
in life is identical, and no difference in ventral colouration is apparent in preservative. The smallest specimen (
SAMA
R 
57868
) lacks pigmented nuptial pads, but does have vocal slits, suggesting it is mature or very nearly so.

but differs notably in a number of characters related to eye colouration, including iris without extensive and heavy black and red pigmentation, sclera black (vs blue), and pigment flecking largely restricted to a band across the dorsal edge of the nictitating membrane (vs dense stippling across membrane). It can also be distinguished from both the species mentioned above by the absence of a white distal edge to the upper eyelid.

were calling from high in the canopy on ridges adjacent to the Tarona River during 

January 
2003
. One specimen was in a tree adjacent to a forest garden and two specimens were collected from primary rainforest in trees overhanging puddles that had formed in a previously dry rocky creek bed after torrential rain. One male descended to within three metres of the pools during observation, suggesting that this species may breed in pools on the forest floor. Descending to the ground after torrential rain to breed is a behaviour typical of several groups of unrelated tropical arboreal frogs e.g

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>
That two new, large and distinctive frog taxa should be identified in the 
21
st Century (and both remain known from a small number of specimens) underlines how poorly the New 
Guinea
frog fauna is understood. The canopy remains a frontier for studies of diversity in tropical forests (

Kays &amp; Allison 
2001
). The difficulty of obtaining material from these arboreal habitats is underlined by the paucity of specimens of the three species discussed here.
</p>
         <p>
Tyler (
1968
)

noted that some 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
‘graminea’

may historically have been confused with 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria infrafrenata</tp:taxon-name>
.

Based on examination of museum specimens (including 
types
of most taxa synonymised with 
<tp:taxon-name>L. infrafrenata</tp:taxon-name>
), a literature review and freshly collected field material we identified a number of consistent morphological characters that readily distinguish 
<tp:taxon-name>L. infrafrenata</tp:taxon-name>
(and taxa synonymised with it) from 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
and the two new species described herein. These include very large size (commonly exceeding 
100 mm
and maximum 
135 mm
; Zweifel 
1980
, pers. obs.), substantially less finger webbing (approximately half­webbed vs fully webbed) and a prominent white labial stripe (vs no labial stripe) (See 

Richards 
et al
. (
2006
)

for a full discussion of synonymy).

Parker (
1936
)

discusses a further specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
“ 
<tp:taxon-name>graminea</tp:taxon-name>
” from Kokoda in the Owen Stanley Ranges. This specimen is said to have a small round nuptial pad, indicating that it is either 
<tp:taxon-name>L. dux</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>L. sauroni</tp:taxon-name>
. Unfortunately this specimen was not lodged in a collection so it is not possible to examine the eye and accurately determine which species it represents. However 

Parker (
1936
)

notes that it conforms with the 
type
description of 
<tp:taxon-name>L. graminea</tp:taxon-name>
, suggesting it has a white distal edge to the upper eyelid; in addition it was collected south the main cordillera, both facts suggest it is likely to be 
<tp:taxon-name>L.sauroni</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
Comprehensive consideration of phylogenetic relationships of the large green 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria</tp:taxon-name>
is beyond the scope of this paper and should involve genetic analyses. However the morphological and ecological similarity of the three taxa discussed herein suggests that they are closely related. In particular 
<tp:taxon-name>L. sauroni</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>L. dux</tp:taxon-name>
share a number of features of gross morphology, including narrow heads and small round nuptial pads. These two species are distinguished predominantly by striking differences in eye colouration. We are unaware of any cases of such striking differences in iris pigmentation within any other anuran species. Preliminary genetic analyses based on the 
12
S and 
16
S mitochondrial genes also demonstrate significant divergence between 
<tp:taxon-name>L. sauroni</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>L. dux</tp:taxon-name>
(Donnellan, Bertozzi &amp; Richards unpubl. data). If these two species are sister taxa it could be another example of isolated, deeply divergent genetic lineages in lowland species or species groups north and south of the main New 
Guinea
cordillera (e.g. 

Rawlings &amp; Donnellan 
2003
, 

Austin 
2000
). In both 
<tp:taxon-name>Candoia
(

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Morelia viridis
(

Rawlings &amp; Donnellan 
2003
)
</tp:taxon-name>
these divergent lineages are also characterised by relatively little discernable morphological differentiation.

         <p>The existence of two putatively related and presumably ecologically similar taxa south of the main cordillera is also noteworthy because, although distributional records are scant, there are no obvious phylogeographic barriers between the two taxa and they could well have overlapping ranges. Studies into both the phylogenetic relationships and nature of potential ecological interactions between these two species could be very interesting, particularly because current data would suggest the calls of the two species, a major isolating character in most frogs, are not noticeably different.</p>

SJR is extremely grateful to Lisa Dabek, Will Betz and the team of the Tree Kangaroo Conservation Project for the invitation to join their Huon Peninsula surveys. He was assisted during these surveys by Mr Wiké who proved to be a most amenable field companion. The 
type
locality for 
<tp:taxon-name>Litoria dux</tp:taxon-name>
is on land belonging to a clan from Yuwong Village, and SJR is most grateful for their hospitality. Field work in Southern Highlands and Gulf Provinces was supported by WWF and SJR is particularly grateful to the following individuals: Max Kuduk, Tanya Leary, Ted Mamu and Amos Ona. WWF also provided funds for the analysis and publication of data collected. Rose Singadan and Paulus Kei (University of 
PNG
) provided support in Port Moresby and Barbara Roy (
PNG
Department of Environment and Conservation) approved the export permit. Jim Robins of the National Research Institute has always been most helpful with SJR’s research visas. Funding for laboratory equipment was provided in part by the Mark Mitchell Research Foundation, and additional support was provided by the Violet Scott Estate and the South Australian Museum Board. The curators of the following museums kindly provided access to specimens in their care; Barry Clarke (Natural History Museum, London), Linda Ford, Jay Savage and Darryl Frost (American Museum of Natural History), Jose Rosado (
MCZ
), Marinus Hoogmoed and Pim Arntzen (
RMNH
), and Giuliano Doria (
MSNG
). Mark Hutchinson, Adam Skinner and Carolyn Secombe provided assistance at the South Australian Museum. During manuscript preparation SJR was supported by a grant from Conservation International, to whom he owes a particular debt of gratitude.
