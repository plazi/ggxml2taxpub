This paper reviews a group of hermaphroditic 
<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha</tp:taxon-name>
species, here designated as the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group. This informal group is characterised by its unique P-maxillae and paired mammillate rosette glands. The three members of the group are simultaneous hermaphrodites and have the chromosome complement of 
2
n = 
8
. 
As
herein defined, the group includes 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. alborana
</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. birgittae
</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
. The three species can be distinguished by the appearance of their eyes and other morphological and reproductive differences. The species are described, and their life table data is presented.

Polychaetes of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha
Claparède &amp; Mecznikow, 
1869</tp:taxon-name>
, found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters such as harbours, have been collected and cultured by us for more than forty years. While the species are very similar in their external morphology, they differ greatly in their reproductive patterns, ranging from hermaphroditism to gonochorism and viviparity (

Åkesson 
1975
a

). Crossing experiments of laboratory cultures led to the recognition of a number of new species, resulting in numerous publications, serving as models for developmental bioassays (
Åkesson 1970
, 
1975b
) and reproductive and life cycle studies (Åkesson 1978, 1982; 

Thornhill 
et al.2009
). Phylogenetic analyses based on morphology, reproductive and electrophoretic characters (

Pleijel &amp; Eide 
1996
) and 
DNA
sequences (

Dahlgren 
et al.2001
; 

Heggøy 
et al.2007
) identified some well supported clades. Studies of the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. labronica
</tp:taxon-name>
group of species (referred to as clade B by 

Dahlgren 
et al.2001
) have recently been completed, presenting formal descriptions of seven species that were formerly known only by their laboratory names or 
nomina nuda
(

Paxton &amp; Åkesson 
2010
). We are here treating the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group of species (referred to as clade A 
2
by 

Dahlgren 
et al.2001
).
</p>
         <p>
Members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group are characterised by the combination of the following features: (
1
) palps absent, replaced by ciliary pads; (
2
) ciliary bands separated by gaps; (
3
) parapodial cirri absent; (
4
) mammillate rosette glands present, known previously only for 
<tp:taxon-name>Mammiphitime
Orensanz, 
1990</tp:taxon-name>
; (
5
) pygidial dorsal stylus absent; (
6
) unique P-maxillae with forceps lacking the serrated comb-like plate and anterior denticles having additional oval ventral plates; (
7
) simultaneous hermaphroditism, chromosome complement of 
2
n = 
8
; and relatively few, large eggs in fusiform egg cases. While the three species are morphologically very similar, they can be distinguished by their eyes and other morphological and reproductive differences. This paper will formally describe the two new species and compare life table data for the three members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha diadema</tp:taxon-name>
group.

The taxonomic study was largely based on the examination of live material reared in culture. Once a week the water (
34
‰ salinity) was changed and the worms were fed spinach which had been fragmented in a blender and soaked in sea water (

Åkesson 
1970
). The origins of the cultures are given in the individual species treatments. The animals examined at higher magnifications were anaesthetized in 
6
% magnesium chloride and mounted on cavity slides, or squash preparations for jaw apparatuses. Specimens preserved for examination and/or 
type
specimens were anaesthetized and fixed in 
70
% ethanol. All drawings were made with the aid of a camera lucida. Photographs were taken with an Olympus SZH stereo microscope with Sony CFW- 
310
C colour digital camera. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. alborana
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
were produced following 

Rouse &amp; Pleijel (
2001
)

and were fixed in 
1
% osmium tetroxide in seawater, critical-point dried, gold coated and examined with a 
JEOL
JSM- 
6480
LA. Specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. birgittae
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
were treated with hexamethyldisilazane (
HMDS
) instead of critical point drying. 
Type
specimens have been deposited at the Australian Museum, Sydney (AM) and the Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm (
SMNH
).
</p>
         <p>
The life-table study followed 
120
fertilised eggs of each of the three species. Embryos and early larvae were observed within the egg masses. Released larvae were distributed among 
30
ml bowls, 
10 in
each bowl. The experiment was not terminated until the last animal had died.

            <p>Remarks.<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha diadema</tp:taxon-name>
was originally collected in 

August 
1972
by Dr. Donald J. Reish (and his daughter) in the harbour of Los Angeles. It proved to be a rare species among those sampled. Only two individuals were brought to Gothenburg together with several hundreds of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. labronica pacifica
</tp:taxon-name>
.

In 
1989
, a second collection of more than 
50
specimens

was made by Åkesson in a small-boat marina in Long Beach, California. The best site was an old piece of rope, overgrown by mussels and other fouling organisms, with 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
living in the interstices of that fouling community. Recently it has been found in the Sicilian harbour of Porto Empedocle (

Simonini 
et al.
2009

, 
2010
), presumably resulting from anthropogenic activities, e.g., transport of ballast water or in fouling material of ships.
</p>
            <p>
Both the two individuals of 
1972
and the population of 
1989
carried an egg colour polymorphism, a diallelic mutation with one dominant (
Y
) and one recessive allele (w) expressing itself as white or pale yellow. The white eggs of the (ww) homozygotes result from the inability of the worms to synthesize lutein (

Sella &amp; Marzoná 
1982
). The mutation remains in the population due to a higher fecundity of the heterozygotes (

Åkesson 
1976
). The YY, Yw, and ww genotypes of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
have been compared in a life table analysis (

Åkesson 
1982
). In the present comparison performed here we used the wild 
type
data (

Table 
2
).
</p>
            <p>
Dr. G. Sella and her team in Torino got an early access to 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
with the three genotypes. In one of their major research projects they analysed the ways in which the functional female in a bond can avoid to be cheated by her partner, i.e., that the male deserts the fertilised female and prefers to repeat the male function together with other females (

Sella &amp; Marzoná 
1982
; 

Sella 
1988
; 

Premoli &amp; Sella 
1995
; 

Sella &amp; Lorenzi 
2000
). Another interesting – and difficult – calculation would be their attempt to determine the sperm redundancy (number of sperm offered per egg). They arrived at the very low figure of 
50
spermatozoa per egg (

Sella 
1990
).
</p>
            <p>
Abiotic factors, such as temperature and salinity and their effect on reproduction, have been studied by 

Åkesson &amp; Costlow (
1978
)

. The optimum salinity is 
33
‰, the optimum temperature occurs at 
25
ºC. In order to facilitate comparisons with the two new species, we have run life tables in a combination of 
33
‰ salinity and 
21
ºC.

is one of the best known polychaetes to be used for bioassays. Many details of its life history can be recorded in those assays: (
1
) time from spawning to larval release; (
2
) the fate of the embryos inside the transparent egg mass; (
3
) the time from larval release to spawning of virginal individuals. It is important, however, to know the genetic properties of the strain used for assays (

Åkesson 
1982
).

reported on toxic effects of dieldrin and two other chemicals. They compared short-term and long-term effects. 

Klöckner (

</p>
            <p>
Prostomium anteriorly rounded, wider than long, dorsoventrally flattened, bearing pair of dorsal cylindrical antennae, palps absent, replaced by ciliated pads (

A–E). Anterior part of prostomium and tips of antennae with small bundles of adjoined tactile cilia, appearing spike-like in living animals. Ciliary bands separated by gaps; two bands of cilia encircling prostomium, one complete circle in front of antennae, and one incomplete circle at level of antennae. Latter interrupted by antennae; cilia between antennae slanting posteriorly, separated by small mid-dorsal space, giving appearance of eyebrows. Additional ventral semicircle of cilia anterior to complete circle. Posterior border of prostomium indicated dorsally by four nuchal organs, ventrally by mouth, lateral restrictions almost absent.
</p>
            <p>
Peristomium represented by two apodous, achaetous segment-like rings, each surrounded by complete circle of cilia. Two eyes, slightly below border between prostomium and peristomium, between inner and outer nuchal organs. Eyes internal, visible only in living animals. Eyes with refractive crystalline platelets as typical for 
<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha</tp:taxon-name>
, appearing silvery white under incident light (

C). Following chaetigers with dorsal and ventral ciliary bands (

F), laterally interrupted by parapodia.
</p>
            <p>
Parapodia uniramous, with acicular lobe and ventral retractile lobe supported by short simple chaeta; dorsal and ventral cirri absent. Supra-acicular fascicle consisting of 
2–3
simple chaetae, subacicular fascicle with 
2–3
heterogomph falcigers and inferiormost simple chaeta. Appendages of falcigers and upper part of simple chaetae serrated with simple distal tip. Mammillate rosette glands, two per segment, present dorsolaterally on up to 
9
posterior segments. Pygidium bearing dorsal anus and pair of dorsal pygidial cirri; dorsal stylus absent (

F).
</p>
            <p>
Jaws consisting of mandibles and maxillae; former permanent, latter undergoing at least two moults. Mandibles consisting of two elongate shafts, widening distally into bifid serrated cutting plates with 
20–24
tiny teeth and large blunt sublateral tooth-like projection at anterior cutting edge of each plate (

G). Shafts of adult animals 
125–140
µm long, with basal and distal lateral thickenings (

H). Maxillary apparatus of P-type only, consisting of forceps fused with carrier-like structure and seven pairs of anterior denticles (D) (

C). Forceps of adult worms 
90–125
µm long, median edge of anterior part of forceps with large distal fang and 
3–5
large teeth irregularly alternating with small teeth, distal fang much larger than other large teeth (

            <p>Reproduction and Development.<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha birgittae</tp:taxon-name>
is hermaphroditic. The first and second chaetigers are sterile, the third and fourth are male, and the remaining ones are female. The chromosome number is 
2
n = 
8
. Newly laid eggs are ovoid, 
200
x 
160
µm. The egg case is firm and elastic, transparent, and of fusiform shape, closed at both ends. The larvae are released from the egg case at the 
4
-chaetiger stage. Larval maxillae (

A) are present in up to 
6
-chaetiger animals, juvenile (P 
1
) maxillae (

B) are found in 
7
- to 
11
-chaetiger animals, and adult (P 
2
) maxillae (

C) from 
12
-chaetiger animals onwards. Other reproductive and population parameters are listed in 

Table

This species is named in honour of Birgitta Åkesson, in appreciation of her continuous support and understanding.

            <p>Remarks.
The new species was originally identified through crossbreeding experiments and has been confirmed by gene sequence studies (

Dahlgren 
et al.2001
; 

Heggøy 
et al
. 
2007
). It can be distinguished from the other two species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group by having separate reflective eyes, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
the eyes are connected, and those of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. alborana
</tp:taxon-name>
have an additional red pigment cup (

), as well as other subtle morphological differences (

Table 
1
), and differing life history parameters (

Table 
2
).

An egg colour polymorphism resulting from a recessive mutant causing the eggs to be white instead of yellow, described for 
<tp:taxon-name>O

               <tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha puerilis</tp:taxon-name>
was reported from the littoral zone of Qingdao harbour by 

Wu (
1981
)

. Wu stated that it occurred in abundance and remained on muddy stones during low tides, suggesting that it might be identical with the species described here. However, the sketch accompanying Wu’s note shows the presence of palps which are found in 
<tp:taxon-name>O

            <p>Remarks.<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha diadema</tp:taxon-name>
was originally collected in 

August 
1972
by Dr. Donald J. Reish (and his daughter) in the harbour of Los Angeles. It proved to be a rare species among those sampled. Only two individuals were brought to Gothenburg together with several hundreds of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. labronica pacifica
</tp:taxon-name>
.

In 
1989
, a second collection of more than 
50
specimens

was made by Åkesson in a small-boat marina in Long Beach, California. The best site was an old piece of rope, overgrown by mussels and other fouling organisms, with 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
living in the interstices of that fouling community. Recently it has been found in the Sicilian harbour of Porto Empedocle (

Simonini 
et al.
2009

, 
2010
), presumably resulting from anthropogenic activities, e.g., transport of ballast water or in fouling material of ships.
</p>
            <p>
Both the two individuals of 
1972
and the population of 
1989
carried an egg colour polymorphism, a diallelic mutation with one dominant (
Y
) and one recessive allele (w) expressing itself as white or pale yellow. The white eggs of the (ww) homozygotes result from the inability of the worms to synthesize lutein (

Sella &amp; Marzoná 
1982
). The mutation remains in the population due to a higher fecundity of the heterozygotes (

Åkesson 
1976
). The YY, Yw, and ww genotypes of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
have been compared in a life table analysis (

Åkesson 
1982
). In the present comparison performed here we used the wild 
type
data (

Table 
2
).
</p>
            <p>
Dr. G. Sella and her team in Torino got an early access to 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
with the three genotypes. In one of their major research projects they analysed the ways in which the functional female in a bond can avoid to be cheated by her partner, i.e., that the male deserts the fertilised female and prefers to repeat the male function together with other females (

Sella &amp; Marzoná 
1982
; 

Sella 
1988
; 

Premoli &amp; Sella 
1995
; 

Sella &amp; Lorenzi 
2000
). Another interesting – and difficult – calculation would be their attempt to determine the sperm redundancy (number of sperm offered per egg). They arrived at the very low figure of 
50
spermatozoa per egg (

Sella 
1990
).
</p>
            <p>
Abiotic factors, such as temperature and salinity and their effect on reproduction, have been studied by 

Åkesson &amp; Costlow (
1978
)

. The optimum salinity is 
33
‰, the optimum temperature occurs at 
25
ºC. In order to facilitate comparisons with the two new species, we have run life tables in a combination of 
33
‰ salinity and 
21
ºC.

is one of the best known polychaetes to be used for bioassays. Many details of its life history can be recorded in those assays: (
1
) time from spawning to larval release; (
2
) the fate of the embryos inside the transparent egg mass; (
3
) the time from larval release to spawning of virginal individuals. It is important, however, to know the genetic properties of the strain used for assays (

Åkesson 
1982
).

reported on toxic effects of dieldrin and two other chemicals. They compared short-term and long-term effects. 

Klöckner (

            <p>Reproduction and Development.<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha birgittae</tp:taxon-name>
is hermaphroditic. The first and second chaetigers are sterile, the third and fourth are male, and the remaining ones are female. The chromosome number is 
2
n = 
8
. Newly laid eggs are ovoid, 
200
x 
160
µm. The egg case is firm and elastic, transparent, and of fusiform shape, closed at both ends. The larvae are released from the egg case at the 
4
-chaetiger stage. Larval maxillae (

A) are present in up to 
6
-chaetiger animals, juvenile (P 
1
) maxillae (

B) are found in 
7
- to 
11
-chaetiger animals, and adult (P 
2
) maxillae (

C) from 
12
-chaetiger animals onwards. Other reproductive and population parameters are listed in 

Table 
2
and will be compared for the three species in the ‘Discussion” below.

            <p>Remarks.
The new species was originally identified through crossbreeding experiments and has been confirmed by gene sequence studies (

Dahlgren 
et al.2001
; 

Heggøy 
et al
. 
2007
). It can be distinguished from the other two species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group by having separate reflective eyes, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
the eyes are connected, and those of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. alborana
</tp:taxon-name>
have an additional red pigment cup (

), as well as other subtle morphological differences (

Table 
1
), and differing life history parameters (

Table 
2
).

An egg colour polymorphism resulting from a recessive mutant causing the eggs to be white instead of yellow, described for 
<tp:taxon-name>O

</tp:taxon-name>
above, has also been observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>O

               <tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha puerilis</tp:taxon-name>
was reported from the littoral zone of Qingdao harbour by 

Wu (
1981
)

. Wu stated that it occurred in abundance and remained on muddy stones during low tides, suggesting that it might be identical with the species described here. However, the sketch accompanying Wu’s note shows the presence of palps which are found in 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. puerilis
</tp:taxon-name>
but absent in

            <p>Remarks.<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha diadema</tp:taxon-name>
was originally collected in 

August 
1972
by Dr. Donald J. Reish (and his daughter) in the harbour of Los Angeles. It proved to be a rare species among those sampled. Only two individuals were brought to Gothenburg together with several hundreds of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. labronica pacifica
</tp:taxon-name>
.

In 
1989
, a second collection of more than 
50
specimens

was made by Åkesson in a small-boat marina in Long Beach, California. The best site was an old piece of rope, overgrown by mussels and other fouling organisms, with 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
living in the interstices of that fouling community. Recently it has been found in the Sicilian harbour of Porto Empedocle (

Simonini 
et al.
2009

, 
2010
), presumably resulting from anthropogenic activities, e.g., transport of ballast water or in fouling material of ships.
</p>
            <p>
Both the two individuals of 
1972
and the population of 
1989
carried an egg colour polymorphism, a diallelic mutation with one dominant (
Y
) and one recessive allele (w) expressing itself as white or pale yellow. The white eggs of the (ww) homozygotes result from the inability of the worms to synthesize lutein (

Sella &amp; Marzoná 
1982
). The mutation remains in the population due to a higher fecundity of the heterozygotes (

Åkesson 
1976
). The YY, Yw, and ww genotypes of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
have been compared in a life table analysis (

Åkesson 
1982
). In the present comparison performed here we used the wild 
type
data (

Table 
2
).
</p>
            <p>
Dr. G. Sella and her team in Torino got an early access to 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
with the three genotypes. In one of their major research projects they analysed the ways in which the functional female in a bond can avoid to be cheated by her partner, i.e., that the male deserts the fertilised female and prefers to repeat the male function together with other females (

Sella &amp; Marzoná 
1982
; 

Sella 
1988
; 

Premoli &amp; Sella 
1995
; 

Sella &amp; Lorenzi 
2000
). Another interesting – and difficult – calculation would be their attempt to determine the sperm redundancy (number of sperm offered per egg). They arrived at the very low figure of 
50
spermatozoa per egg (

Sella 
1990
).
</p>
            <p>
Abiotic factors, such as temperature and salinity and their effect on reproduction, have been studied by 

Åkesson &amp; Costlow (
1978
)

. The optimum salinity is 
33
‰, the optimum temperature occurs at 
25
ºC. In order to facilitate comparisons with the two new species, we have run life tables in a combination of 
33
‰ salinity and 
21
ºC.

is one of the best known polychaetes to be used for bioassays. Many details of its life history can be recorded in those assays: (
1
) time from spawning to larval release; (
2
) the fate of the embryos inside the transparent egg mass; (
3
) the time from larval release to spawning of virginal individuals. It is important, however, to know the genetic properties of the strain used for assays (

Åkesson 
1982
). 

Reish &amp; Carr (

used

in an analysis of heavy metals. 

Hooftman &amp; Vink (

reported on toxic effects of dieldrin and two other chemicals. They compared short-term and long-term effects. 

Klöckner (

studied effects of cadmium on three consecutive generations. Recently, 

Knowles &amp; Greenwood (

used seven continuous generations of

            <p>Reproduction and Development.<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha birgittae</tp:taxon-name>
is hermaphroditic. The first and second chaetigers are sterile, the third and fourth are male, and the remaining ones are female. The chromosome number is 
2
n = 
8
. Newly laid eggs are ovoid, 
200
x 
160
µm. The egg case is firm and elastic, transparent, and of fusiform shape, closed at both ends. The larvae are released from the egg case at the 
4
-chaetiger stage. Larval maxillae (

A) are present in up to 
6
-chaetiger animals, juvenile (P 
1
) maxillae (

B) are found in 
7
- to 
11
-chaetiger animals, and adult (P 
2
) maxillae (

C) from 
12
-chaetiger animals onwards. Other reproductive and population parameters are listed in 

Table 
2
and will be compared for the three species in the ‘Discussion” below.

            <p>Etymology.
This species is named in honour of Birgitta Åkesson, in appreciation of her continuous support and understanding.

            <p>Remarks.
The new species was originally identified through crossbreeding experiments and has been confirmed by gene sequence studies (

Dahlgren 
et al.2001
; 

Heggøy 
et al
. 
2007
). It can be distinguished from the other two species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group by having separate reflective eyes, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
the eyes are connected, and those of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. alborana
</tp:taxon-name>
have an additional red pigment cup (

), as well as other subtle morphological differences (

Table 
1
), and differing life history parameters (

Table 
2
).

An egg colour polymorphism resulting from a recessive mutant causing the eggs to be white instead of yellow, described for 
<tp:taxon-name>O

</tp:taxon-name>
above, has also been observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>O

               <tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha puerilis</tp:taxon-name>
was reported from the littoral zone of Qingdao harbour by 

Wu (
1981
)

. Wu stated that it occurred in abundance and remained on muddy stones during low tides, suggesting that it might be identical with the species described here. However, the sketch accompanying Wu’s note shows the presence of palps which are found in 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. puerilis
</tp:taxon-name>
but absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>O

A, B). Anterior part of prostomium and tips of antennae with small bundles of adjoined tactile cilia, appearing spike-like in living animals. Ciliary bands separated by gaps; two bands of cilia encircling prostomium, one complete circle in front of antennae, and one incomplete circle at level of antennae. Latter interrupted by antennae; cilia between antennae slanting posteriorly, separated by small mid-dorsal space, giving appearance of eyebrows. Additional ventral semicircle of cilia anterior to complete circle. Posterior border of prostomium indicated dorsally by four nuchal organs, ventrally by mouth, lateral restrictions almost absent.

was originally collected in 

August 
1972
by Dr. Donald J. Reish (and his daughter) in the harbour of Los Angeles. It proved to be a rare species among those sampled. Only two individuals were brought to Gothenburg together with several hundreds of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. labronica pacifica
</tp:taxon-name>
.

In 
1989
, a second collection of more than 
50
specimens

was made by Åkesson in a small-boat marina in Long Beach, California. The best site was an old piece of rope, overgrown by mussels and other fouling organisms, with 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
living in the interstices of that fouling community. Recently it has been found in the Sicilian harbour of Porto Empedocle (

Simonini 
et al.
2009

, 
2010
), presumably resulting from anthropogenic activities, e.g., transport of ballast water or in fouling material of ships.
</p>
            <p>
Both the two individuals of 
1972
and the population of 
1989
carried an egg colour polymorphism, a diallelic mutation with one dominant (
Y
) and one recessive allele (w) expressing itself as white or pale yellow. The white eggs of the (ww) homozygotes result from the inability of the worms to synthesize lutein (

Sella &amp; Marzoná 
1982
). The mutation remains in the population due to a higher fecundity of the heterozygotes (

Åkesson 
1976
). The YY, Yw, and ww genotypes of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
have been compared in a life table analysis (

Åkesson 
1982
). In the present comparison performed here we used the wild 
type
data (

Table 
2
).
</p>
            <p>
Dr. G. Sella and her team in Torino got an early access to 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
with the three genotypes. In one of their major research projects they analysed the ways in which the functional female in a bond can avoid to be cheated by her partner, i.e., that the male deserts the fertilised female and prefers to repeat the male function together with other females (

Sella &amp; Marzoná 
1982
; 

Sella 
1988
; 

Premoli &amp; Sella 
1995
; 

Sella &amp; Lorenzi 
2000
). Another interesting – and difficult – calculation would be their attempt to determine the sperm redundancy (number of sperm offered per egg). They arrived at the very low figure of 
50
spermatozoa per egg (

Sella 
1990
).
</p>
            <p>
Abiotic factors, such as temperature and salinity and their effect on reproduction, have been studied by 

Åkesson &amp; Costlow (
1978
)

. The optimum salinity is 
33
‰, the optimum temperature occurs at 
25
ºC. In order to facilitate comparisons with the two new species, we have run life tables in a combination of 
33
‰ salinity and 
21
ºC.

is one of the best known polychaetes to be used for bioassays. Many details of its life history can be recorded in those assays: (
1
) time from spawning to larval release; (
2
) the fate of the embryos inside the transparent egg mass; (
3
) the time from larval release to spawning of virginal individuals. It is important, however, to know the genetic properties of the strain used for assays (

Åkesson 
1982

Wu (

         <p>Morphology and reproduction.As
far as size and overall morphology are concerned, the three species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group are typical members of 
<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha</tp:taxon-name>
. Their coherence as a group has been demonstrated by phylogenetic analyses employing electrophoresis (

Pleijel &amp; Eide 
1996
) and 
DNA
sequences (Dahlgren 
el al.2001
; 

Heggøy 
et al.2007
). The clade can further be characterised by the combination of a number of morphological and reproductive attributes which are discussed below. Most of these are also found in other members of the genus; however, it is the combination of these features that characterise the three species as a coherent group.
</p>
         <p>
(
1
) Prostomial palps are absent, but in the ventrolateral position where palps would be located, we find adjoined tactile cilia that appear in SEM images as ciliary pads (

E). Similarly reduced palps have been reported for 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. socialis

Ockelmann &amp; Åkesson, 
1990</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
(
2
) The cilia making up ciliary bands are not just continuous rows. High resolution SEM images show them as bundles of cilia with each bundle acting as a unit (e.g. 

Paxton &amp; Åkesson 
2007
: 

B). In previously studied species this has been overlooked since the bundles are so close to each other that they appear as a continuous row. In the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group however, the individual bundles are visible in all three species as they are separated by small gaps (

G).

         <p>
(

</p>
         <p>
(

) Mammillate rosette glands. Rosette glands, large segmental epidermal glands were first described by 

Braem (
1893
)

for 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. puerilis
</tp:taxon-name>
and named for the circular arrangement of their oblong cells. They are paired flat dorsal structures in the posterior segments of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. puerilis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. shieldsi

Paxton &amp; Davey, 
2010</tp:taxon-name>
, paired flat ventral in 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. hartmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
, and single flat dorsal in the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. labronica
</tp:taxon-name>
group (
Paxton &amp; Åkesson 2007
, 
2010
). While they have been recognised only for a small group of species, they are most likely present in all species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha</tp:taxon-name>
.

The function of the rosette glands is unknown, although a role in mating or spawning is presumed. Schlawny (l 
983
) investigated the morphology and histochemistry of the rosette glands, established that they secrete basic proteins in granular form and speculated that the secretions act as pheromones.
</p>
         <p>
Members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group have rosette glands that range from being slightly raised to little mounds, topped by a nipple-like extension, ending in a flat, perforated area (

C, D, G; 
4
E, F; 
5
F). Similar structures were first described for 
<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha cosmetandra
Oug, 
1990</tp:taxon-name>
as dorsolateral processes on posterior segments of males (

Oug 
1990
). 

Orensanz (
1990
)

observed these ‘mammillate’ structures in a new 
Antarctic
species, and erected the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>Mammiphitime
Orensanz, 
1990</tp:taxon-name>
for 
<tp:taxon-name>M. tridentata
Orensanz, 
1990</tp:taxon-name>
. Besides the mammillate glands, the genus was diagnosed as having composite spinigers, tridentate mandibles, and P- and K-maxillae, characters that are also found in 
<tp:taxon-name>M. cosmetandra</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
The mammillate structures of 
<tp:taxon-name>Mammiphitime</tp:taxon-name>
have a similar appearance to the rosette glands of the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group. Based on their location and histological studies by 

Oug (
1990
)

we recognise them also as rosette glands. Their occurrence in two genera raises the issues that the rosette glands either evolved their mammillate shape independenly, or it puts the validity of 
<tp:taxon-name>Mammiphitime</tp:taxon-name>
in doubt, as it would place 
<tp:taxon-name>Mammiphitime</tp:taxon-name>
within 
<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
(
5
) A pygidial dorsal stylus is present in many juvenile 
<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha</tp:taxon-name>
species but absent in adults (e.g. 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. labronica
</tp:taxon-name>
group), or even remains as a small structure in 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. puerilis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>O

</tp:taxon-name>

In the

</tp:taxon-name>
group, however, it has not been observed in any stage.

</p>
         <p>
(

) 
As
typical for 
<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha</tp:taxon-name>
, the maxillary apparatus goes through a series of moults from the initial larval jaws to the juvenile (P 
1
) and adult (P 
2
) maxillae. Each jaw stage consists of basal plates or forceps fused with a carrier-like structure and anterior denticles (D). All maxillary elements are interconnected by the cuticle. The larval maxillae (L) (

A) consist of only four paired plates and are similar to other 
<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha</tp:taxon-name>
larval maxillae. The pair of dorsalmost posterior slender plates represent the larval forceps, followed by a pair of large plates representing D 
1
and two pairs of smaller plates of the D 
4–7type
. The juvenile maxillae (

B) are of the same 
type
as the adult ones but have only six pairs of anterior denticles, while the adult maxillae have seven pairs (

I, J; 
6
C). The P-maxillae of the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group have some unique features. While the forceps look similar to those of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. puerilis
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. gracilis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. hartmanni
</tp:taxon-name>
(clade A 
1
of 

Dahlgren 
et al.2001
), closer inspection shows an important difference. The only serrations on the forceps of the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group are on the median edge. However, in 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. puerilis
</tp:taxon-name>
and related species, the forceps have a little finely serrated comb-like structure slightly posterior and lateral to the main serrated edge (

Paxton &amp; Åkesson 
2007
: 

E

). Another important characteristic of the P-maxillae of the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group is that the anterior denticles D 
4
to D 
7
are ventrally associated with small sclerotised plates. In a squash preparation the little plates become laterally displaced and can be visible as sclerotised oval structures on the clear cuticle (

C). Their 
in situ
position is better realised in a ventral view SEM image of the maxillae, where the plates are clearly associated with the anterior denticles D 
4
to D 
7
(

I). The most anterior one, associated with (D 
7
), is slightly smaller and not visible in the squash preparations. Similar structures have only been reported in one other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha</tp:taxon-name>
,

namely 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. lipscombae

Lu &amp; Fauchald, 
2000</tp:taxon-name>
from the 
U.S.
Atlantic slope, from a depth of 
1830 m
. The K-type maxillae of this species were reported to have two rows of five sclerotised black accessory plates, associated with D 
1
and D 
5
to D 
7
.

         <p>
(
7
) The three species of the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group are simultaneous hermaphrodites, have a chromosome complement of 
2
n = 
8
, and relatively few, large eggs in fusiform egg cases. Although one or two of these reproductive characteristics are also found in other species, the combination of all three is limited to the 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
group.
</p>
         <p>Life table studies. Water temperature.
Temperature and salinity are important influences on the life cycle of small shallow water marine organisms like 
<tp:taxon-name>Ophryotrocha</tp:taxon-name>
species. 

Åkesson &amp; Costlow (
1978
)

have studied these effects on 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
and have shown that reproduction and larval development was successful between 
11
ºC and 
27
ºC. The strain studied originated from Los Angeles, where the mean water temperatures vary between 
14.4
ºC and 
20
ºC during the year. Here we are presenting results of fecundity studies in 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. alborana
</tp:taxon-name>
, from the Alboran Sea (

). At 
18
ºC, fecundity is about 
90
% of the figures for 
21
ºC, whereas 
15
ºC yields only 
40
% of the optimum fecundity at 
21
ºC. At 
25
ºC, fecundity is even lower, only about 
15
% of optimum fecundity. The results show that the range of optimum temperatures is narrow; this agrees with surface water temperatures for the Alboran Sea ranging from 
16
ºC in February to 
22.5
ºC in October. Future studies, extending such investigations to 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. birgittae
</tp:taxon-name>
should be interesting, as the mean water temperatures in Qingdao harbour range from 
3
ºC in February to 
25
ºC in August, requiring a huge tolerance.

         <p>Population parameters.
The average length of life is superior in 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. birgittae
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
85
weeks, followed by 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
50
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. alborana
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
28
weeks (

). It is interesting to note the respective points to 
50
% survival, which are 60, 27, and 
18
weeks (

), in other words, at 
71
%, 
54
% and 
64
% of their respective life times. Although 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. alborana
</tp:taxon-name>
has the lowest life expectancy of the three species, in the lack of competition we have been able to maintain thriving populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. alborana
</tp:taxon-name>
at the laboratory for more than 
30
years.
</p>
         <p>
The population parameters of the three species are summarised in 

Table 
2
. Surprisingly, the intrinsic rate of increase (
r
) was highest for 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
, even though their population doubling time was lowest. The intrinsic rate of increase, 
r
/wk, is part of the Lotka equation: Σ e–rx 
l
x 
m
x= 
1
. It is the fraction at which a population is growing at each instant of time. Three major factors are included: (
1
) natality, (
2
) mortality, and (
3
) time from zygote formation to the first spawning (

Lewontin 
1965
). The high figures for life expectancy and the larger number of eggs per egg mass does not bring 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. birgittae
</tp:taxon-name>
up to the same level as 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
.

This can be explained by the fact that the reproductive value (Vx) of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
during the first ten weeks of life is much higher than that of 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. birgittae
</tp:taxon-name>
(

). The age specific variation in time intervals between consecutive spawnings for the three species demonstrates that while 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
does not live as long as 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. birgittae
</tp:taxon-name>
,

the former spawns more often than the latter as shown in 

.
</p>
         <p>
When comparing morphological characteristics (

Table 
1
) and the data from the life tables (

Table 
2
), it appears that 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. birgittae
</tp:taxon-name>
has more in common with 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. diadema
</tp:taxon-name>
than with 
<tp:taxon-name>O
. alborana
</tp:taxon-name>
,

even though 
DNA
sequencing analyses are ambiguous in this respect.
