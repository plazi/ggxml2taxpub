         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>
The Northern Andes harbor an astonishing diversity of endemic dendrobatid frogs including those in the genera 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Allobates</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne</tp:taxon-name>
. Among them, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
is the most enigmatic with a complex taxonomic history. When it was coined, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
included a single species (
<tp:taxon-name>A. nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
) recognized as the putative sister taxon of all living dendrobatids (

Myers 
et al.1991
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
presented several autopomorphies such as a unique defensive mercaptanlike odor and the 
adductor mandibulae externus superficialis
muscle, but it also included “basal” traits such as nocturnal behavior and aquatic habits (

Myers 
et al.1991
). Subsequently, 

La Marca (“ 
1991
” 
1994
) described 
<tp:taxon-name>Nephelobates</tp:taxon-name>
for most of the former phenetic 
<tp:taxon-name>Colostethus alboguttatus</tp:taxon-name>
group (
sensu
Rivero 
1988
) based on presence of fang-like teeth, and a dermal covering of the cloaca. Moreover, 

La Marca (“ 
1991
” 
1994
) considered the fang-like teeth as “derived” among dendrobatids and suggested that 
<tp:taxon-name>Nephelobates</tp:taxon-name>
evolved this trait independently within 
<tp:taxon-name>Dendrobatidae</tp:taxon-name>
. 

Mijares-Urrútia &amp; La Marca (
1997
)

expanded the definition of 
<tp:taxon-name>Nephelobates</tp:taxon-name>
by including tadpole characteristics (e.g. oral disc and narial morphology), which supposedly distinguished 
<tp:taxon-name>Nephelobates</tp:taxon-name>
from 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>A. nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
only in that moment). However, 

Grant 
et al.
(
1997
)

on addressing the taxonomic status of 
<tp:taxon-name>Colostethus</tp:taxon-name>
questioned the validity of 
<tp:taxon-name>Nephelobates</tp:taxon-name>
. They pointed out that some of the synapomorphies of 
<tp:taxon-name>Nephelobates</tp:taxon-name>
such as fang-like teeth were indeed present in 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
         <p>
Only after molecular phylogenies became available, 

Grant 
et al.
(
2006
)

synonymized 
<tp:taxon-name>Nephelobates</tp:taxon-name>
with 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
showing that 
<tp:taxon-name>A. nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
was nested within 
<tp:taxon-name>Nephelobates</tp:taxon-name>
. This taxonomic action raised the total number of species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
from 
1 to 12
by including 
<tp:taxon-name>Nephelobates</tp:taxon-name>
species from most of Rivero’s 
<tp:taxon-name>Colostethus alboguttatus</tp:taxon-name>
group (

Rivero 
1988
). It was noted that most 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
have a conservative morphology, making species identification difficult when only based on external characteristics. To our knowledge, there are no morphological synapomorphies for 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
(see discussion) and this genus is arguably supported by a list of molecular synapomorphies (

Grant 
et al
. 
2006
). To this date, the search for morphological, behavioral, physiological, and genomic synapomorphies of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
continues.
</p>
         <p>
The known diversity of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
includes 
14
described species, 
12
endemic to the Venezuelan Cordillera de Mérida (

Barrio-Amorós 
2009
a

; Barrio-Amorós 
et al.2011
), one (
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
) shared between the Cordillera de Mérida and the northernmost part of the Cordillera Oriental of 
Colombia
, and one recently described from the Sierra de Perijá (

Rojas-Runjaic 
et al.2011
). The first 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
species described was 
<tp:taxon-name>Phyllobates albogutatus</tp:taxon-name>
by 

Boulenger (
1903
)

from a series of individuals collected by Mr. Briceño in Mérida (
Venezuela
). Seventy years later, a second species was described from Chorotal (~ 
30 km
North of Mérida) as 
<tp:taxon-name>Colostethus meridensis
(Dole &amp; Durant 
1973
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. During the 
1970
’s, Juan A. Rivero described six species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
as a result of his extended work with the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas. Rivero’s descriptions of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
taxa (

Rivero 
1976
) included 
<tp:taxon-name>Colostethus haydeeae</tp:taxon-name>
from Páramo Zumbador in Estado Táchira, 
<tp:taxon-name>C. leopardalis</tp:taxon-name>
from Páramo Mucubají in Estado Mérida, and 
<tp:taxon-name>C. orostoma</tp:taxon-name>
from Boca del Monte, Estado Táchira. 

Rivero (
1978
)

included the descriptions of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. inflexus</tp:taxon-name>
from “El Almogral” on the road to Pregonero, 
<tp:taxon-name>C. mayorgai</tp:taxon-name>
from Chorotal, Estado Mérida, and 
<tp:taxon-name>C. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
from western Estado Táchira. However, 

Rivero (
1984
“ 
1982
”) relegated 
<tp:taxon-name>C. inflexus</tp:taxon-name>
as a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. alboguttatus</tp:taxon-name>
. In 
1980
’s, several authors described three more species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
with apparently restricted distributions (i.e. known only for their 
type
localities). These descriptions included 
<tp:taxon-name>Colostethus duranti</tp:taxon-name>
from La Culata, 
<tp:taxon-name>C. serranus</tp:taxon-name>
from the road to El Morro, Estado Mérida (

Péfaur 
1985
), and 
<tp:taxon-name>C. molinarii</tp:taxon-name>
from Bailadores and Las Playitas, Estado Mérida (

La Marca 
1985
). In the 
1990
’s, 

Myers 
et al.
(
1991
)

described 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
with an unusual high detail in terms of its morphology, tadpoles, and toxicological charaterization; but they fell short in describing its vocalization. 

Péfaur (
1993
)

described 
<tp:taxon-name>Colostethus capurinensis</tp:taxon-name>
from Páramo El Molino, Estado Mérida. Tadpoles of several species were also described (

Mijares-Urrútia &amp; La Marca 
1997
). During 
2000
’s, a series of molecular phylogenies provided insights of large undescribed diversity within 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g., 

La Marca 
et al.2002
and 

Grant 
et al.2006
). In 
2010
’s, two more species were described including 
<tp:taxon-name>A. tokuko</tp:taxon-name>
from Sierra de Perijá in Estado Zulia (

Rojas-Runjaic 
et al.2011
) and 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ornatissimus
(Barrio-Amorós 
et al.2011
)
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Cordillera de Mérida in Estado Trujillo.
</p>
         <p>
In an effort to estimate the diversity of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
, we explored several parts of the Venezuelan Andes and discovered five new species, three of which are described herein. Furthermore, we provide an updated phylogeny of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
, including notes on morphology, and natural history of two populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
. We also provide some comments on 
<tp:taxon-name>A. inflexus</tp:taxon-name>
and provide some suggestion for further research on this species. Finally, we provide some insights about the conservation status of Venezuelan 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
and a discussion of the current taxonomic assessment of this genus.

Our assessment of species identification was confirmed by using the diagnosis provided on the relevant literature: Dole &amp; Durant (
1973

for 
<tp:taxon-name>nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
. The webbing formula follows the definition by 

Myers &amp; Duellman (
1982
)

. Sex was determined by combination of the presence of testes and vocal slits (males) or oviducts (females), and direct observation of calling males. Measurements of adult frogs were taken to the nearest 
0.1 mm
using a digital caliper (see 

Table 
1
). The advertisement calls were recorded at approximately 
0.5
–1.0 m from calling animals using a portable Sony stereo cassette recorder WM-D 
6
C and a Sennheiser ME 
67
directional microphone onto TDK MA 
90
metal bias tape cassettes. Data on the temperature were also registered from the substrate where the frogs were calling. The recordings were digitized using Adobe Audition 3.0 (Adobe Systems, CA) and encoded as Windows 
PCM
files and formatted at 
24
-bit. Call variables were analyzed using Sound Analysis Software 
RAVEN
Pro 
1.4
(

Charif 
et al
. 
2010
). The spectrograms were performed using the Hamming window 
type
, 
900
-sample size, and a bandwidth filter of 
63.7
Hz. The dominant frequency was determined using the spectrogram slice view. Call parameters measured include (
1
) pulse duration, (
2
) interval between pulses or time between the beginning of the first pulse and the next, (
3
) number of pulses per second, and (
4
) dominant frequency.

Phylogenetic relationships within 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
were estimated from three mitochondrial and two nuclear genes. All PCR reactions were performed using primers and conditions for 

Santos &amp; Cannatella (
2011
)

. The mitochondrial segment included 
12
S-tRNAVal- 
16
S rRNA with ~ 
2,400
bp (also known as H 
1
segment). The two nuclear gene segments were proopiomelanocortin A (
POMC
) and NCX 
1
sodium-calcium exchanger 
1
(
NACA
) with a combined length of ~ 
1,728
bp. Sequence validation was performed using NCBI-BLAST to rule out contamination. Additional sequences were obtained from GenBank including other dendrobatids and hyloid frogs (for accession numbers see 

). Sequence alignment was performed using SATé (Simultaneous Alignment and Tree Estimation; 

Liu 
et al.
, 
2009
). Tree estimation and nodal support were calculated as follows (
1
) the molecular model for each segment was determined using jModelTest (

Posada 
2008
) and it was found to be GTR+Γ+I for all, and (
2
) phylogenies were estimated using maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP), and Bayesian approaches using RAxML 7.0. 
4
(

Stamatakis 
2006
), Paup v. 4.0 (

Swofford 
2000
), and MrBayes v. 
3.4
(

Huelsenbeck &amp; Ronquist 
2001
) respectively. ML analyses used 
20
different random starting numbers, and only the best score phylogeny is reported; MP analyses used a heuristic approach with indel sites treated as missing, random addition of taxa, and using the branch-swapping algorithm with tree-bisection-reconnection (
TBR
); and Bayesian estimation was done using default settings for all priors. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (
MCMC
) setup for the Bayesian analysis included four independent runs, each one with four chains of 
30
million generations with a sampling rate every 
1,000
generations. The convergence of the runs was determined using Tracer v. 
1.4
(

Rambaut &amp; Drummond 
2007
). From all analyses, nodal support were determined after 
200
non-parametric bootstrap replicates for both ML and MP, and posterior probabilities for Bayesian analyses.

as the closest taxa to last common ancestor of

,

and (

taxa. Overall, the phylogeny of the

is well-resolved at the species level (i.e., most nodal support&gt;

<tp:taxon-name>A. nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
have the north-easternmost distribution. This last species was also supported as sister taxon to the rest of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
species which have a more central and southwestern distribution along the Cordillera de Mérida. Among the species with central distribution, we found 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates molinarii</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. meridensis</tp:taxon-name>
, and two unnamed species, one from Calderas Estado Barinas (Barrio-Amorós 
2010
) and the other from the paramo de Mucuchíes (for discussion on its possible identity, see below). Following the south-western progression, we found 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
and two new species described here. All three species are distributed nearby the Táchira Depression and close to border between 
Venezuela
and 
Colombia
. Finally, we found a recent radiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
into Northern Eastern Andes of 
Colombia
by a possible unnamed species related to one of the new species described herein, but identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
from Cubará, 
Colombia
by 

Grant et al. (

</p>
         <p>Color:
The specimen in life has a general very dark, almost black coloration (

A). Dorsum is black with small brown spots on the frontal area; it has two dark brown dorsolateral stripes, from the tip of the snout through the canthus rostralis, above the eye, reaching the sacral area, becoming paler behind the eye to the sacrum. Flanks are black with the oblique lateral stripe that is constituted by a series of small but diffuse white spots. There is a series of small irregular dirty white spots on the upper lip area and on the insertion of the upper arm. Arms are dirty black, with small brown spots on the forearm. Upper surface of thighs and shank are dark brown with one black crossbar and diffuse black spotting. Tarsi and anterior side of thighs are grey to black. Hands and feet are black dorsally. Ventrally the specimen is light grey.
</p>
         <p>
After preservation, the 
holotype
is mainly black in coloration. The dorsolateral stripes are indistinct grey, and crossbars are more evident on hind limbs. Ventrally, the specimen’s throat, chest, and belly are evenly stippled black under magnification, giving it a general ventral coloration that is dark grey. Under the specimen hind limbs areas, their coloration is pale grey. Specimen’s palms and soles are pale dark grey. Undersides of discs are pale grey.

</p>
         <p>Variation.
No other males are known to determine conspecific variability. Females are larger and apparently dichromatic. Morphological differences include the absence of fringes on fingers II and III. The only female photographed alive (
CVULA8328
) is the darkest of the series (

C). Dorsum brown with dorsolateral stripes are pale brown and not very distinctive. Specimens are without an evident pattern on their dorsal, arms, and hind limbs; flanks have the same dark coloration than dorsum, except ventrally and closer to their bellies, where they become white. Specimens’ oblique lateral stripe is pale yellow, diffuse, and ill defined. Specimens are ventrally grey, patternless, with a profusion of melanophores under magnification (

D). In preservative, specimens are dorsally dark grey with dorsolateral stripes ill defined, little paler than surrounding background; hind limbs are brown with ill-defined crossbars. In preservative, 
CVULA8325
- 
26
specimens

have similar colorations. Their dorsa are brown and irregularly spotted, the dorsolateral stripes are pale brown to grey and well-defined, and their flanks are darker. Variation on oblique lateral stripe ranges from well-defined as in 
CVULA8326
(similar to that in 

B) to a series of white spots as in 
CVULA8325
. All specimens have evident crossbars on their legs. The venter of all specimens is white with a diffuse grey spotting extending to their throat and chest. Palms and soles are dark grey as in 
CVULA8325
to pale grey as on 
CVULA8326
. The anal sheath is indistinct in all examined specimens.

         <p>Natural history.
All individuals were active during the day. The habitat is evergreen Andean forest, where the species is strictly limited to slow-flowing streams. The 
type
locality offers three different microhabitats. One is a large slab where the water runs, as a small canyon (

), another is on the edges of a natural pool created by a waterfall, and a third one was at the entrance to a natural cave where a small stream flowed to the exterior. Males usually called from concealed spots such as leaf litter debris or under rocks. 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates cannatellai</tp:taxon-name>
is sympatric, but was not seen syntopically, with 
<tp:taxon-name>Allobates algorei</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne orellana</tp:taxon-name>
. Other herpetofauna associated at the 
type
locality are 
<tp:taxon-name>Gonatodes ligiae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Bothrops venezuelensis</tp:taxon-name>
, the latter of which could act as a potential predator.

Background noise has been strongly reduced and frequencies below 100–500 Hz were filtered from the spectrogram.

         <p>Vocalization.
A single call was analyzed, recorded at 
21.4
ºC (substrate temperature) at dusk on 

June 
6
th, 
2007
at the 
type
locality. The vocalization is a constant trill and it lasted for several minutes. We used 
25.6
sec of the recorded call for analysis, which consisted of 
133
pulsed notes. The waveform of a section of the call is showed in 

A and the corresponding spectrogram in 

B. Six consecutive notes were chosen at random to determine spectral and temporal variables. The dominant frequency range is 2998.0– 
3236.9
Hz. Pulse rate was 
5–6
pulses per second. Note and inter-note duration with their mean, SD and range in seconds were (

         <p>Phylogenetic relationships.
The sister taxon of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates cannatellai</tp:taxon-name>
is an undescribed species from 
Colombia
identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
by 

Grant 
et al.
(
2006
)

from Cubará. We have not revised the voucher specimen (
MUJ3726
from the Museo de Historia Natural, Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, 
Colombia
) and we are not able to rule out if 
<tp:taxon-name>A. cannatellai</tp:taxon-name>
and the Colombian specimen are conspecific. We could have considered 
MUJ3726
as 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates
aff. 
cannatellai</tp:taxon-name>
. However, we think that this individual affinity to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. cannatellai</tp:taxon-name>
should be determined only after comparison of its voucher 
MUJ3726
with the 
<tp:taxon-name>A. cannatellai</tp:taxon-name>type
series. For discussion on Grant’s 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>

FIII
disc is barely wider than distal end of adjacent phalanx; the base of palm has a large, rounded palmar tubercle; and on base of FI there is a smaller (approximately 
1

3
of the palmar tubercle), oval thenar tubercle; one or two subarticular tubercles on fingers (one each on FI and FII, two each on 
FIII
and FIV, the distal one of FIV inconspicuous); and all tubercles are flat and round or oval; without supernumerary tubercles. Fringes on fingers are low and indistinct on FI and 
FIII
of right hand (well preserved), and very notable on all fingers of left hand except FI (somewhat dehydrated). However, we think that these differences are obviously due to preservation and consider them of somehow doubtful validity for taxonomy of

            <p>Color.
The specimen in life had its dorsum patternless dark brown except for the interorbital area where it was paler irregular with diffuse markings (

A). Two golden cream dorsolateral stripes are present from the tip of snout through the canthus rostralis and over the eyelid to the sacral area. Flanks are blackish brown immediately inferior to the dorsolateral stripes, including the loreal region; flanks below the dark brown area present a pale grey coloration with a diffuse to whitish spotting. The oblique lateral stripe is evidenced by diffuse spots ranging from yellow at the inguinal zone to dirty white for the remaining of the stripe. The length of the oblique lateral stripe begins at the inguinal zone and ends at mid flank. The upper lips are dark grey with striking white irregular large spots. Arms are greyish brown, with a pale cream area on the upper insertion of the arm, and they have a diffuse dark brown longitudinal stripe on the anterior side of the arm. Fingers are uniformly grey. 
Hind
limbs are pale brown in their dorsal side and ornamented with darker crossbars.
</p>
            <p>
After preservation, the 
holotype
presents some evident coloration changes. The dorsolateral stripes became strikingly white and the crossbars are clearly visible on both arms and hind limbs. On the ventral side, the specimen presents a dark brown reticulation on throat and chest while the belly remained white. Palms and plants are pale grey in coloration.
</p>
            <p>Variation.
Preserved specimens appear to have smooth skin, while living animals have shagreen to granular dorsal and lateral skin (

C). Some color variation is evidenced on the granules of the thighs and some of them are white in coloration. The dorsal pattern observed in the 
holotype
is similar as in three other males (
CVULA
8299, 8311- 
12
) though the pale dorsolateral stripes are much more evident on the 
holotype
. Variation was observed and some males are paler (orange brown in life) dorsally, with less marked crossbars on the limbs (
CVULA
8306, 8308, 
8310
and 
8305
). On 
CVULA
8299, 8308 and 
8311
, the dorsolateral stripes are ill-defined. Females are slightly larger in SVL than males, with 
6
of 
8
specimens

having a dark brown dorsal background with only one specimen (
CVULA8303
) having well-defined dorsolateral stripes. All specimens have a oblique lateral stripe ranging from more or less defined to a ill-defined by a series of white spots (

A). A vocal sac is evident on the male 
CVULA8299
. Ventrally, the coloration of this species is sexually dimorphic. Breeding males usually have dark throats but a more whitish belly with some variation. For example, the 
holotype
and 
CVULA
8299, 8311, and 
8312
have their chins, throats, and chests strongly to diffusely reticulated, 
CVULA8306
has a diffusely spotted throat, and 
CVULA
8305, 8308 and 
8310
have dirty white coloration (with only a profusion of melanophores on the chin under magnification). Females also present some variation in their chin and throat coloration ranging from uniformly dirty white (
CVULA8313
- 
14
) or little spotted (
CVULA8300
) to evidently irregular markings without reticulation as in 
CVULA8303
-04, 
8301
-02.
</p>
            <p>
In life, the dorsal coloration can be dark brown to orange brown, and without pattern to one consisting of small dark brown spots with paravertebral distribution. The dorsolateral stripes can be white, pale yellow to orange (

B). Ventrally, all specimens photographed are pale grey on the throat, immaculate white on the belly; the inguinal area, the thighs and shanks are pale yellow (

D). The anal sheath is evident in the 
holotype
and 
CVULA
8308, 8305, 
8310
, and 
8299
; but it is not evident in the males 
CVULA
8306, 8311- 
12
. The anal sheath is also present in females except on 
CVULA8301
and 
8314
. The anal sheath was found to be variable and most likely caused by preservation artifacts (

            <p>Distribution and natural history.
We found four populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
(

). The topotypic population is located on a deep creek outside the small village of Los Ranchos, with males calling from the leaf litter, and females in close proximity. However, the frogs were never seen directly in the creek, which suggest that this species is riparian. All individuals were active during the day. Several small tadpoles were seen but not captured in small pools in the creek. One juvenile of 
<tp:taxon-name>Scinax manriquei
Barrio-Amoros, Chacon &amp; Orellana, 
2004</tp:taxon-name>
, was also seen in the same location.
</p>
            <p>
Another close population of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
was discovered in a different habitat in the locality of Santa Cruz de Mora via Los Ranchos. This collection site is an open stream within a deciduous forest, where other species of dendrobatid are present (
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne collaris
, 

Barrio-Amorós 
et al.2010

</tp:taxon-name>
). The three individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
collected there were found on the forest floor or close to tree roots along the banks of a stream. Remarkably, these 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
were not as agile as 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne</tp:taxon-name>
and much easier to collect. Along the stream, several large individuals of fishing spiders (
<tp:taxon-name>Sparassidae</tp:taxon-name>
) were seen syntopically with both 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. collaris</tp:taxon-name>
. CBA has seen events of predation by these spiders on 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne</tp:taxon-name>
and they might also prey on

.

A third population of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
is present at the lower mountain forest along the road from La Azulita to 
Santa Elena
de Arenales, where males can be heard from forests along the road from La Palmita to Olinda in rainy days. The fourth population of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
is located around Río Frío and its based on a single specimen. At this locality, the individual was found in a secondary forest close to a mountain stream flowing to Río Frío and sympatric with

            <p>Color of the series.
After preservation, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates zippeli</tp:taxon-name>
specimens have their dorsum very dark brown, with a little evident vertebral stripe made by small pale white spots, starting from the tip of snout to the sacrum. The two dorsolateral stripes are pale blue in life (appearing white in preservative) with small spots. Specimen flanks are black with an irregular oblique lateral stripe also made by small dirty white spots; some white spots are on the lowest part of the flanks, close to the paler ventral area. Arms are dark brown with fine irregular pale brown spotting. 
Hind
limbs are dark brown without definite crossbars; thighs are paler than shanks, all with irregular pale brown spotting. Ventrally, throat and chest grey are evenly spotted with a profusion of melanophores (only seen under magnification); belly is dirty white, with scattered melanophores, and a few indistinct (only possible to distinguish under microscope) bluish white spots. Palms and soles are dark brown.
</p>
            <p>
Coloration in life specimens 
(
based on living, not collected specimens and 
CVULA8341
) is as follows. The dorsum can be olive (

A), light to dark brown or even black, with an irregular pattern. Alternatively, the dorsum can have irregular spotting of dark brown over a light brown background or it can be brown over black (

B). Flanks are dark brown to black, always darker than the dorsum. The two light dorsolateral stripes can be pale yellow, golden, or olive; but are always paler than the dorsum and flanks. The ventrolateral stripe is absent. The oblique lateral stripe can be short, just in the inguinal area, or long, extending above the upper arms. This stripe is always formed by small bright white spots, than can be pale blue at midbody or above the upper arms. Arms and hind limbs have also a pale background with irregular dark spotting or crossbars. The most striking chromatic character of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates zippeli</tp:taxon-name>
is that any part of its dorsal body can be covered by small rounded bluish to white spots, especially in the flanks, dorsum (even over the dorsolateral stripes), upper lips and loreal region. Ventrally (

B) a subadult female (
CVULA8341

            <p>Variation.
Dorsal skin can be smooth to shagreen without tubercles, both in living and preserved specimens. Fringes on fingers and toes are present on all specimens. Tarsal keel in this species is indistinct in almost all specimens, but it is completely absent in 
CVULA8338
and 
8340
. Only 
CVULA8335
and 
8337
have what appears to be an anal sheath; this data agrees with 

Grant 
et al.
(
2006
)

, which prevented that this characteristic can be variable. 
CVULA8339
presented an extra toe on the left foot. The extra toe rises from the 
TIII
towards its superior side, being of the same length and having a small disc and fringes. This case of complete polydactylia is the second reported in Venezuelan dendrobatids, after a case of partial polydactylia on 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne riveroi</tp:taxon-name>

CVULA8334

            <p>
The color pattern variation was also present (

C). One individual (
CVULA8340
) has irregular dark blotches on dorsum; while the series 
CVULA8337
- 
38
are patternless dorsally and their dorsolateral stripes are thin but not made with spots. Crossbars are also variable from distinct (
CVULA
8332, 8335) to indistinct or ill-defined. Ventrally, males are usually darker than females. Male 
CVULA8333
is the darkest in coloration, 
CVULA8331
- 
32
are similar to the 
holotype
, and 
CVULA8336
is the ventrally paler in coloration. This last specimen appears to be white at first glance with some melanophores on the throat under magnification. Females of

Rivero (

described variation within 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
by confronting the 
type
specimen against a subadult (
UPRM5593
) also collected from the 
type
locality. However, the description provided in 

Rivero (
1978
)

does not allow us to unambiguously evaluate the variation among our referred series. Therefore, we provide a description of the variation only based on our referred series. Males have a SVL range of 
22–23.1 mm
, and females SVL range of 
22.9–26.9
based on three adult specimens of each sex. Body is slender, round to quadrangular in cross-section. Dorsal skin, including dorsal surfaces of hind limbs is smooth, shagreen to finely granular, without tubercles on the posterior part of the body in preservative. Ventral skin is smooth. Head is longer than wide, HeL = 
35.8–37.9
% SVL; HW = 
32.8–36.3
% SVL. On males, snout is truncated to pointed in profile. On females, snout is rounded to slightly pointed. Nares are situated laterally to the tip of snout; narial openings are barely visible when viewing the head from the front, not visible when viewing dorsally; and they are visible when viewing from a ventral perspective. Canthus rostralis is angular, the loreal region is almost flat; interorbital region is little wider than the upper eyelid. Snout is longer than ED. Only half of the tympanum is distinct and it is visible at its anteroventral portion but concealed posterodorsally by a low supratympanic bulge formed by the superficial slip of 
m. depressor mandibulae
. The tympanum is positioned closely behind eye and close to the angle of jaws. Teeth are present on maxillary arch. Vocal slits are short to long, arched from mid-level of tongue to the anterior angle of the jaws. The tongue is short, oval to triangular; it is half free posteriorly.
</p>
            <p>
Hand is of moderate size (
25–28.2
% SVL); relative lengths of adpressed fingers are III&gt; I&gt; II&gt; IV; discs of all fingers are weakly expanded, horizontally oval to round; 
FIII
is barely wider than distal end of adjacent phalanx, at its maximum point is 
1.3
wider; the base of palm has a large, palmar tubercle, rounded, quadrangular to heartshaped; and on the base of FI there is a smaller (approximately 
1
/ 
3
of the palmar tubercle), oval to elongate thenar tubercle; one or two subarticular tubercles on fingers (one each on FI and FII, two each on 
FIII
and FIV); and all tubercles are flat to round or oval; without supernumerary tubercles. Fringes on fingers are mainly absent, but on some males and females can be present, they are low and indistinct on FII and 
FIII
.

TIII
and TV, three on TIV, proximal one almost indistinct); two metatarsal tubercles are present, including a small rounded outer, and a slightly larger oval inner tarsal tubercle; mid-tarsal tubercles are seldom seen; tarsal keel is well-defined, thick, straight, transverse across tarsus, from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to mid-tarsus, with an ending tubercle-like structure; cloacal opening is located at the upper level of thighs, with short tube flap or anal sheath.
</p>
            <p>Comparison with the original description.
When compared with the original description (

Rivero 
1978
), we found a few additional details that should be noted. First, 

Rivero (
1978
)

does not note a supratympanic bulge, but this characteristic varies depending on the preservation method. Second, Rivero also mention the presence of basal webbing between FII-III-IV, which is absent on the referred specimens examined (another character that can vary in preserved specimens). All the remaining characteristics described for the 
holotype
are among the variation seen in the new specimens collected.
</p>
            <p>Color.
The referred specimens in life have dorsa with pale to dark brown coloration, patternless or presenting irregular spotting; the dorsolateral stripes can be very distinct (

A) to ill-defined (

C), pale orange to dark brown. The flanks can have a narrow dark brown longitudinal band below the dorsolateral stripe or they can be completely dark brown to the ventral area. The oblique lateral stripe can be solid, diffuse, or almost absent (consisting in a few, irregular and indistinct dirty white spots in the inguinal zone, even not forming a real stripe). Upper lips are patternless. Arms and hind limbs can be pale orange or brown to dark brown, with darker well-defined to ill-defined crossbars. Ventrally, males are pale grey on the throat and chest, white on the belly, with some opaque yellow on the hind limbs (

B). Females are plain grey on the throat, dirty white on the belly (

D). Iris is bronze with black reticulation; iris ring is also bronze.
</p>
            <p>Preserved specimens have a minimal dichromatism slightly apparent ventrally on males, as they have darker throats (pale to dark grey), consisting of a profusion of melanophores under magnification. Females are all white (with a few melanophores under magnification). The rest of the body coloration is not dichromatic in both sexes, varying in being paler or darker, with well or ill-defined crossbars on hind limbs.</p>
            <p>Natural history.
We found all 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
associated to a slow flowing creeks surrounded by pastures (
type
locality), primary, and secondary forests (Rio Frio, Tamá). Several males were calling from exposed and concealed sites in the creek, such as on the top of rocks or behind small waterfalls. Some females were seen moving along the creek as well. All individuals were active during daytime.
</p>
            <p>Vocalization.
The analyzed call is a section of a trill that lasted several minutes. The call was recorded at 
22.5
ºC (water temperature) at early afternoon on the 

June 
9
th, 
2007
near the 
type
locality (see referred specimens). The analyzed section of the call has four duplets of notes (

), lasting 
2
sec. One to two duplets of notes are produced per second. The dominant frequency of the first pulse is slightly lower than the second. The first pulse has a dominant frequency range of 3437.0– 
3862.7
Hz. The second pulse has a dominant frequency range of 3511.0 –3862.0 Hz. Four consecutive duplets were chosen at random from the spectrogram to determine temporal variables. Duplet duration

<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
specimens provided by 

Grant

. (
2006

and we found it to be problematic. The information provided of the specimens 
ICN42512
- 
16
and 
33587
is inaccurate as they are from two distinct and geographically distant localities on the western slopes of the Northern Andes of 
Colombia
. Moreover, it is not justified why all specimens are assigned to a single population from Bacar[a]sica (the name is misspelled as ‘Bucarsica’ in the original paper, 

Grant 
et al.2006
: 
242
). First, the locality information for the specimens 
ICN42512
- 
16
corresponds to Corregimiento Pueblo Nuevo, Sitio El Reposo, 
4.8 km
on the road of Ocaña to Pueblo Nuevo (
8.2304
N

, 
73.3890

at ~ 
1560 m
). This locality is 
61 km
WNW of the Bacar[a]sica site provided by 

Grant

. Second, the data provided for the specimen 
ICN33587
corresponds only to the municipality and the following information is more accurate: 
25.3 km

1040 m
, municipio Bacarasica, Norte de Santander. The approximate coordinates of

</p>
            <p>
Grant

. (

provided information of a third population that most likely is based on molecular data (no information is provided about specimen morphological identification). The voucher specimen is 
MUJ3726
(Museo de Historia Natural, Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, 
Colombia
) from Cubará, Fátima, Quebrada Gralanday in Boyacá on the eastern slopes of the Northern Andes of 
Colombia
, which is closer in our analysis to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. cannatellai</tp:taxon-name>
than to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
, although both species are nested in a “ 
<tp:taxon-name>saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
” clade. The approximate coordinates for the 
MUJ3726
specimen are 
6.8790
N

and 
72.1879
W

. The distance from the Cubará population to the two other northern populations in Norte de Santader is 
160–200 km
in straight line. Moreover, all localities of the 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
specimens from 

Grant

. (
2006
)

are at least 
61
kms of distance from the approximate

provided by Rivero’s description near Michelena (
7.9676
N

and 
72.2612
W

) on the Mérida Andes. Specifically, Sardinata is at least 
61 km
W, Pueblo Nuevo is at least 
128 km
WNW, and Cubará is at least 
122 km
S from Michelena. 

Anganoy-Criollo (
2012
)

reported further extension in the distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>A.
cf. 
saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
from two new localities in the southernmost edge and western versant of the Sierra de Perijá at ~ 
133 km
northwest from Michelena 
type
locality. These two new localities are very close within the Departamento de Cesar, namely, El Gitano (near 
Rio de Oro
at approximately 
8.3166
N

, 
73.4167
W

) and San Cayetano (near Gonzales at approximately 
8.3931
N

, 
73.3844
W

). 

La Marca (
2005
)

, on the other hand, has suggested that 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
species most likely show restricted distributions with no more than 
60–70 km2
. Therefore, it is unclear to us if all these specimens correspond to a single species or even less if they are conspecific with 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
or even with 
<tp:taxon-name>A. tokuko</tp:taxon-name>
(see phylogenetic relationships below). Thus, we consider the presence of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Colombia
as highly unlikely, but closely related allies might be present.
</p>
            <p>
Our referred specimens are less than 
13 km
from the 
type
locality near Michelena. The original description 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis
(

Rivero 
1978
)
</tp:taxon-name>
indicates a collection site at an elevation of 
830 m
on the road from La Fria (elevation 
119 m
) to Michelena (elevation 
1230 m
) in Estado Táchira (
Venezuela
); this road is 
25 km
long. The locality of the 
CVULA8315
– 
20
specimens

are from the same road described by 

Rivero (
1978
)

, and about 
12.5 km
from the georeferenced 
type
locality. In consequence, we consider the 
CVULA8315
– 
20
series to be topotypic. The series 
CVULA8321
– 
24
from ‘Rio Frío, Tamá’ is about 
44 km
from 
type
locality. Therefore, according to our data, we consider 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
to be endemic to 
Venezuela
. However, we suggest a careful comparison of all 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

and our specimens with the 
typeUPRM5147
(University of 
Puerto Rico
) to further confirm our insights.
</p>
            <p>Phylogenetic relationships.
We found 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
to be well-nested in 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
(

). This suggests a relative recent extension and radiation of the 
<tp:taxon-name>saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
clade into Eastern Cordillera of 
Colombia
. 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

provided nuclear and mitochondrial sequences from a specimen identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
with the voucher number 
MUJ3726
from Cubará (
Colombia
: Boyacá). However, it is unclear if these authors actually identified the specimen as 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
as discussed on previous section. We found 
MUJ3726
to be closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. cannatellai</tp:taxon-name>
based on the 
12
S- 
16
S rRNA segment. At the moment, we suggest recognizing 
MUJ3726
as voucher from a different species and we restrict 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
only to the Venezuelan localities.

Description of the 
holotype
.

The 
holotype
is an adult male of 
21.7 mm
(

A): body slender, quadrangular in cross-section; dorsal skin, including dorsal surfaces of hind limbs, and smooth in preservative; ventral skin is smooth except on belly sides, where it is granular; its head is longer than wide, HeL = 
37.7
% of SVL; HW = 
33.6
% SVL; its snout is subacuminate in profile, inclined posteroventrally, rounded in dorsal and ventral view; its nares are situated laterally to the tip of snout; its narial openings are barely visible when viewing the head from the front, they are not visible from the dorsal side, and visible when viewing from the ventral aspect; its canthus rostralis is sloping, the loreal region is flat; interorbital region is little wider than the upper eyelid; snout longer than ED; tympanum is indistinct, only barely visible on its anteroventral portion, and concealed posterodorsally by a low supratympanic bulge formed by the superficial slip of 
m. depressor mandibulae
; tympanum is positioned closely behind eye and lower, close to the angle of jaws; teeth present on maxillary arch; vocal slits large, arched from midlevel of tongue to anterior to the angles of jaws; tongue is short, oval, and half-free posteriorly.
</p>
            <p>
Hand has a moderate size (
27.6
% SVL); relative lengths of adpressed fingers are III&gt; I&gt; II&gt; IV; discs of all fingers are slightly expanded, horizontally oval; 
FIII
disc is barely wider than distal end of adjacent phalanx; the base of palm has a large, rounded palmar tubercle; and on base of FI there is a smaller (approximately 
1
/ 
3
of the palmar tubercle), oval thenar tubercle; one or two subarticular tubercles on fingers (one each on FI and FII, two each on 
FIII
and FIV, the distal one of FIV inconspicuous); and all tubercles are flat and round or oval; without supernumerary tubercles. Fringes on fingers are low and indistinct on FI and 
FIII
of right hand (well preserved), and very notable on all fingers of left hand except FI (somewhat dehydrated). However, we think that these differences are obviously due to preservation and consider them of somehow doubtful validity for taxonomy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>Hind
limbs are of moderate length, SL = 
51.1
% of SVL; relative lengths of adpressed toes are IV&gt; III&gt; V&gt; II&gt; I; TI is moderately long, the tip reaching the mid-subarticular tubercle of TII; toe discs are moderately expanded, TIV about 
1.8
times wider than distal end of adjacent phalanx; feet are basally webbed; fringes on toes are present but low; one to three are non-protuberant and small subarticular tubercles are present (one on TI and TII, two on 
TIII
and TV, three on TIV, proximal one almost indistinct); two metatarsal tubercles are present, including a small oval outer, and a similar in size elongated inner tarsal tubercle; on right foot there is a mid-tarsal tubercle (lacking on left foot), this tubercle is double size of the two others; tarsal keel is well-defined, thick, straight, and transverse across tarsus, located from the proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to mid-tarsus; cloacal opening is located at upper level of thighs, with a short tube flap or anal sheath.

            <p>Color.
The specimen in life had its dorsum patternless dark brown except for the interorbital area where it was paler irregular with diffuse markings (

A). Two golden cream dorsolateral stripes are present from the tip of snout through the canthus rostralis and over the eyelid to the sacral area. Flanks are blackish brown immediately inferior to the dorsolateral stripes, including the loreal region; flanks below the dark brown area present a pale grey coloration with a diffuse to whitish spotting. The oblique lateral stripe is evidenced by diffuse spots ranging from yellow at the inguinal zone to dirty white for the remaining of the stripe. The length of the oblique lateral stripe begins at the inguinal zone and ends at mid flank. The upper lips are dark grey with striking white irregular large spots. Arms are greyish brown, with a pale cream area on the upper insertion of the arm, and they have a diffuse dark brown longitudinal stripe on the anterior side of the arm. Fingers are uniformly grey. 
Hind
limbs are pale brown in their dorsal side and ornamented with darker crossbars.
</p>
            <p>
After preservation, the 
holotype
presents some evident coloration changes. The dorsolateral stripes became strikingly white and the crossbars are clearly visible on both arms and hind limbs. On the ventral side, the specimen presents a dark brown reticulation on throat and chest while the belly remained white. Palms and plants are pale grey in coloration.
</p>
            <p>Variation.
Preserved specimens appear to have smooth skin, while living animals have shagreen to granular dorsal and lateral skin (

C). Some color variation is evidenced on the granules of the thighs and some of them are white in coloration. The dorsal pattern observed in the 
holotype
is similar as in three other males (
CVULA
8299, 8311- 
12
) though the pale dorsolateral stripes are much more evident on the 
holotype
. Variation was observed and some males are paler (orange brown in life) dorsally, with less marked crossbars on the limbs (
CVULA
8306, 8308, 
8310
and 
8305
). On 
CVULA
8299, 8308 and 
8311
, the dorsolateral stripes are ill-defined. Females are slightly larger in SVL than males, with 
6
of 
8
specimens

having a dark brown dorsal background with only one specimen (
CVULA8303
) having well-defined dorsolateral stripes. All specimens have a oblique lateral stripe ranging from more or less defined to a ill-defined by a series of white spots (

A). A vocal sac is evident on the male 
CVULA8299
. Ventrally, the coloration of this species is sexually dimorphic. Breeding males usually have dark throats but a more whitish belly with some variation. For example, the 
holotype
and 
CVULA
8299, 8311, and 
8312
have their chins, throats, and chests strongly to diffusely reticulated, 
CVULA8306
has a diffusely spotted throat, and 
CVULA
8305, 8308 and 
8310
have dirty white coloration (with only a profusion of melanophores on the chin under magnification). Females also present some variation in their chin and throat coloration ranging from uniformly dirty white (
CVULA8313
- 
14
) or little spotted (
CVULA8300
) to evidently irregular markings without reticulation as in 
CVULA8303
-04, 
8301
-02.
</p>
            <p>
In life, the dorsal coloration can be dark brown to orange brown, and without pattern to one consisting of small dark brown spots with paravertebral distribution. The dorsolateral stripes can be white, pale yellow to orange (

B). Ventrally, all specimens photographed are pale grey on the throat, immaculate white on the belly; the inguinal area, the thighs and shanks are pale yellow (

D). The anal sheath is evident in the 
holotype
and 
CVULA
8308, 8305, 
8310
, and 
8299
; but it is not evident in the males 
CVULA
8306, 8311- 
12
. The anal sheath is also present in females except on 
CVULA8301
and 
8314
. The anal sheath was found to be variable and most likely caused by preservation artifacts (

et al.

            <p>Distribution and natural history.
We found four populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
(

). The topotypic population is located on a deep creek outside the small village of Los Ranchos, with males calling from the leaf litter, and females in close proximity. However, the frogs were never seen directly in the creek, which suggest that this species is riparian. All individuals were active during the day. Several small tadpoles were seen but not captured in small pools in the creek. One juvenile of 
<tp:taxon-name>Scinax manriquei
Barrio-Amoros, Chacon &amp; Orellana, 
2004</tp:taxon-name>
, was also seen in the same location.
</p>
            <p>
Another close population of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
was discovered in a different habitat in the locality of Santa Cruz de Mora via Los Ranchos. This collection site is an open stream within a deciduous forest, where other species of dendrobatid are present (
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne collaris
, 

Barrio-Amorós 
et al.2010

</tp:taxon-name>
). The three individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
collected there were found on the forest floor or close to tree roots along the banks of a stream. Remarkably, these 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
were not as agile as 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne</tp:taxon-name>
and much easier to collect. Along the stream, several large individuals of fishing spiders (
<tp:taxon-name>Sparassidae</tp:taxon-name>
) were seen syntopically with both 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. collaris</tp:taxon-name>
. CBA has seen events of predation by these spiders on 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne</tp:taxon-name>
and they might also prey on 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
.

            <p>
A third population of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
is present at the lower mountain forest along the road from La Azulita to 
Santa Elena
de Arenales, where males can be heard from forests along the road from La Palmita to Olinda in rainy days. The fourth population of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
is located around Río Frío and its based on a single specimen. At this locality, the individual was found in a secondary forest close to a mountain stream flowing to Río Frío and sympatric with 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne urticans</tp:taxon-name>

            <p>Color of the series.
After preservation, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates zippeli</tp:taxon-name>
specimens have their dorsum very dark brown, with a little evident vertebral stripe made by small pale white spots, starting from the tip of snout to the sacrum. The two dorsolateral stripes are pale blue in life (appearing white in preservative) with small spots. Specimen flanks are black with an irregular oblique lateral stripe also made by small dirty white spots; some white spots are on the lowest part of the flanks, close to the paler ventral area. Arms are dark brown with fine irregular pale brown spotting. 
Hind
limbs are dark brown without definite crossbars; thighs are paler than shanks, all with irregular pale brown spotting. Ventrally, throat and chest grey are evenly spotted with a profusion of melanophores (only seen under magnification); belly is dirty white, with scattered melanophores, and a few indistinct (only possible to distinguish under microscope) bluish white spots. Palms and soles are dark brown.
</p>
            <p>
Coloration in life specimens 
(
based on living, not collected specimens and 
CVULA8341
) is as follows. The dorsum can be olive (

A), light to dark brown or even black, with an irregular pattern. Alternatively, the dorsum can have irregular spotting of dark brown over a light brown background or it can be brown over black (

B). Flanks are dark brown to black, always darker than the dorsum. The two light dorsolateral stripes can be pale yellow, golden, or olive; but are always paler than the dorsum and flanks. The ventrolateral stripe is absent. The oblique lateral stripe can be short, just in the inguinal area, or long, extending above the upper arms. This stripe is always formed by small bright white spots, than can be pale blue at midbody or above the upper arms. Arms and hind limbs have also a pale background with irregular dark spotting or crossbars. The most striking chromatic character of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates zippeli</tp:taxon-name>
is that any part of its dorsal body can be covered by small rounded bluish to white spots, especially in the flanks, dorsum (even over the dorsolateral stripes), upper lips and loreal region. Ventrally (

B) a subadult female (
CVULA8341
) was found to be patternless with a dirty yellow to dirty white background; a series of very diffuse small pale white spots were distinguished under magnification.
</p>
            <p>Variation.
Dorsal skin can be smooth to shagreen without tubercles, both in living and preserved specimens. Fringes on fingers and toes are present on all specimens. Tarsal keel in this species is indistinct in almost all specimens, but it is completely absent in 
CVULA8338
and 
8340
. Only 
CVULA8335
and 
8337
have what appears to be an anal sheath; this data agrees with 

Grant 
et al.
(
2006
)

, which prevented that this characteristic can be variable. 
CVULA8339
presented an extra toe on the left foot. The extra toe rises from the 
TIII
towards its superior side, being of the same length and having a small disc and fringes. This case of complete polydactylia is the second reported in Venezuelan dendrobatids, after a case of partial polydactylia on 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne riveroi</tp:taxon-name>
(

Barrio-Amorós 
et al.2010
c

). 
CVULA8334
has the last section of FII and III missing, showing the phalanges exposed.
</p>
            <p>
The color pattern variation was also present (

C). One individual (
CVULA8340
) has irregular dark blotches on dorsum; while the series 
CVULA8337
- 
38
are patternless dorsally and their dorsolateral stripes are thin but not made with spots. Crossbars are also variable from distinct (
CVULA
8332, 8335) to indistinct or ill-defined. Ventrally, males are usually darker than females. Male 
CVULA8333
is the darkest in coloration, 
CVULA8331
- 
32
are similar to the 
holotype
, and 
CVULA8336
is the ventrally paler in coloration. This last specimen appears to be white at first glance with some melanophores on the throat under magnification. Females of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates zippeli</tp:taxon-name>
have paler ventral surfaces, mostly whitish with few scattered melanophores on the throat.

Rivero (

described variation within 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
by confronting the 
type
specimen against a subadult (
UPRM5593
) also collected from the 
type
locality. However, the description provided in 

Rivero (
1978
)

does not allow us to unambiguously evaluate the variation among our referred series. Therefore, we provide a description of the variation only based on our referred series. Males have a SVL range of 
22–23.1 mm
, and females SVL range of 
22.9–26.9
based on three adult specimens of each sex. Body is slender, round to quadrangular in cross-section. Dorsal skin, including dorsal surfaces of hind limbs is smooth, shagreen to finely granular, without tubercles on the posterior part of the body in preservative. Ventral skin is smooth. Head is longer than wide, HeL = 
35.8–37.9
% SVL; HW = 
32.8–36.3
% SVL. On males, snout is truncated to pointed in profile. On females, snout is rounded to slightly pointed. Nares are situated laterally to the tip of snout; narial openings are barely visible when viewing the head from the front, not visible when viewing dorsally; and they are visible when viewing from a ventral perspective. Canthus rostralis is angular, the loreal region is almost flat; interorbital region is little wider than the upper eyelid. Snout is longer than ED. Only half of the tympanum is distinct and it is visible at its anteroventral portion but concealed posterodorsally by a low supratympanic bulge formed by the superficial slip of 
m. depressor mandibulae
. The tympanum is positioned closely behind eye and close to the angle of jaws. Teeth are present on maxillary arch. Vocal slits are short to long, arched from mid-level of tongue to the anterior angle of the jaws. The tongue is short, oval to triangular; it is half free posteriorly.
</p>
            <p>
Hand is of moderate size (
25–28.2
% SVL); relative lengths of adpressed fingers are III&gt; I&gt; II&gt; IV; discs of all fingers are weakly expanded, horizontally oval to round; 
FIII
is barely wider than distal end of adjacent phalanx, at its maximum point is 
1.3
wider; the base of palm has a large, palmar tubercle, rounded, quadrangular to heartshaped; and on the base of FI there is a smaller (approximately 
1
/ 
3
of the palmar tubercle), oval to elongate thenar tubercle; one or two subarticular tubercles on fingers (one each on FI and FII, two each on 
FIII
and FIV); and all tubercles are flat to round or oval; without supernumerary tubercles. Fringes on fingers are mainly absent, but on some males and females can be present, they are low and indistinct on FII and 
FIII
.

TIII
and TV, three on TIV, proximal one almost indistinct); two metatarsal tubercles are present, including a small rounded outer, and a slightly larger oval inner tarsal tubercle; mid-tarsal tubercles are seldom seen; tarsal keel is well-defined, thick, straight, transverse across tarsus, from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to mid-tarsus, with an ending tubercle-like structure; cloacal opening is located at the upper level of thighs, with short tube flap or anal sheath.
</p>
            <p>Comparison with the original description.
When compared with the original description (

Rivero 
1978
), we found a few additional details that should be noted. First, 

Rivero (
1978
)

does not note a supratympanic bulge, but this characteristic varies depending on the preservation method. Second, Rivero also mention the presence of basal webbing between FII-III-IV, which is absent on the referred specimens examined (another character that can vary in preserved specimens). All the remaining characteristics described for the 
holotype
are among the variation seen in the new specimens collected.
</p>
            <p>Color.
The referred specimens in life have dorsa with pale to dark brown coloration, patternless or presenting irregular spotting; the dorsolateral stripes can be very distinct (

A) to ill-defined (

C), pale orange to dark brown. The flanks can have a narrow dark brown longitudinal band below the dorsolateral stripe or they can be completely dark brown to the ventral area. The oblique lateral stripe can be solid, diffuse, or almost absent (consisting in a few, irregular and indistinct dirty white spots in the inguinal zone, even not forming a real stripe). Upper lips are patternless. Arms and hind limbs can be pale orange or brown to dark brown, with darker well-defined to ill-defined crossbars. Ventrally, males are pale grey on the throat and chest, white on the belly, with some opaque yellow on the hind limbs (

B). Females are plain grey on the throat, dirty white on the belly (

D). Iris is bronze with black reticulation; iris ring is also bronze.
</p>
            <p>Preserved specimens have a minimal dichromatism slightly apparent ventrally on males, as they have darker throats (pale to dark grey), consisting of a profusion of melanophores under magnification. Females are all white (with a few melanophores under magnification). The rest of the body coloration is not dichromatic in both sexes, varying in being paler or darker, with well or ill-defined crossbars on hind limbs.</p>
            <p>Natural history.
We found all 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
associated to a slow flowing creeks surrounded by pastures (
type
locality), primary, and secondary forests (Rio Frio, Tamá). Several males were calling from exposed and concealed sites in the creek, such as on the top of rocks or behind small waterfalls. Some females were seen moving along the creek as well. All individuals were active during daytime.
</p>
            <p>Vocalization.
The analyzed call is a section of a trill that lasted several minutes. The call was recorded at 
22.5
ºC (water temperature) at early afternoon on the 

June

type
locality (see referred specimens). The analyzed section of the call has four duplets of notes (

), lasting 
2
sec. One to two duplets of notes are produced per second. The dominant frequency of the first pulse is slightly lower than the second. The first pulse has a dominant frequency range of 3437.0– 
3862.7

<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
specimens provided by 

Grant

. (
2006

and we found it to be problematic. The information provided of the specimens 
ICN42512
- 
16
and 
33587
is inaccurate as they are from two distinct and geographically distant localities on the western slopes of the Northern Andes of 
Colombia
. Moreover, it is not justified why all specimens are assigned to a single population from Bacar[a]sica (the name is misspelled as ‘Bucarsica’ in the original paper, 

Grant 
et al.2006
: 
242
). First, the locality information for the specimens 
ICN42512
- 
16
corresponds to Corregimiento Pueblo Nuevo, Sitio El Reposo, 
4.8 km
on the road of Ocaña to Pueblo Nuevo (
8.2304

, 
73.3890

at ~ 
1560 m

61 km
WNW of the Bacar[a]sica site provided by

. Second, the data provided for the specimen

</p>
            <p>
Grant

. (

provided information of a third population that most likely is based on molecular data (no information is provided about specimen morphological identification). The voucher specimen is 
MUJ3726
(Museo de Historia Natural, Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, 
Colombia
) from Cubará, Fátima, Quebrada Gralanday in Boyacá on the eastern slopes of the Northern Andes of 
Colombia
, which is closer in our analysis to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. cannatellai</tp:taxon-name>
than to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
, although both species are nested in a “

” clade. The approximate coordinates for the 
MUJ3726
specimen are 
6.8790
N

and 
72.1879
W

. The distance from the Cubará population to the two other northern populations in Norte de Santader is 
160–200 km
in straight line. Moreover, all localities of the 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
specimens from 

Grant

. (
2006
)

are at least 
61
kms of distance from the approximate

provided by Rivero’s description near Michelena (
7.9676

) on the Mérida Andes. Specifically, Sardinata is at least 
61 km
W, Pueblo Nuevo is at least 
128 km
WNW, and Cubará is at least 
122 km
S from Michelena. 

Anganoy-Criollo (
2012

reported further extension in the distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>A.
cf. 
saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
from two new localities in the southernmost edge and western versant of the Sierra de Perijá at ~ 
133 km
northwest from Michelena

Rio de Oro

8.3166
N

, 
73.4167

) and San Cayetano (near Gonzales at approximately 
8.3931
N

, 
73.3844
W

). 

La Marca (

)

, on the other hand, has suggested that 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
species most likely show restricted distributions with no more than 
60–70 km2
. Therefore, it is unclear to us if all these specimens correspond to a single species or even less if they are conspecific with 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
or even with 
<tp:taxon-name>A. tokuko</tp:taxon-name>
(see phylogenetic relationships below). Thus, we consider the presence of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Colombia
as highly unlikely, but closely related allies might be present.
</p>
            <p>
Our referred specimens are less than 
13 km
from the 
type
locality near Michelena. The original description 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis
(

Rivero 
1978
)
</tp:taxon-name>
indicates a collection site at an elevation of 
830 m
on the road from La Fria (elevation 
119 m
) to Michelena (elevation 
1230 m
) in Estado Táchira (
Venezuela
); this road is 
25 km
long. The locality of the 
CVULA8315
– 
20
specimens

are from the same road described by 

Rivero (
1978
)

, and about 
12.5 km
from the georeferenced 
type
locality. In consequence, we consider the 
CVULA8315
– 
20
series to be topotypic. The series 
CVULA8321
– 
24
from ‘Rio Frío, Tamá’ is about 
44 km
from 
type
locality. Therefore, according to our data, we consider 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
to be endemic to 
Venezuela
. However, we suggest a careful comparison of all 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006

and our specimens with the 
typeUPRM5147
(University of 
Puerto Rico
) to further confirm our insights.

<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
(

). This suggests a relative recent extension and radiation of the 
<tp:taxon-name>saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
clade into Eastern Cordillera of 
Colombia
. 

Grant 
et al
. (

)

provided nuclear and mitochondrial sequences from a specimen identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
with the voucher number 
MUJ3726
from Cubará (
Colombia
: Boyacá). However, it is unclear if these authors actually identified the specimen as 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
as discussed on previous section. We found 
MUJ3726
to be closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. cannatellai</tp:taxon-name>
based on the 
12
S- 
16
S rRNA segment. At the moment, we suggest recognizing 
MUJ3726
as voucher from a different species and we restrict 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
only to the Venezuelan localities.

Description of the 
holotype
.

The 
holotype
is an adult male of 
21.7 mm
(

A): body slender, quadrangular in cross-section; dorsal skin, including dorsal surfaces of hind limbs, and smooth in preservative; ventral skin is smooth except on belly sides, where it is granular; its head is longer than wide, HeL = 
37.7
% of SVL; HW = 
33.6
% SVL; its snout is subacuminate in profile, inclined posteroventrally, rounded in dorsal and ventral view; its nares are situated laterally to the tip of snout; its narial openings are barely visible when viewing the head from the front, they are not visible from the dorsal side, and visible when viewing from the ventral aspect; its canthus rostralis is sloping, the loreal region is flat; interorbital region is little wider than the upper eyelid; snout longer than ED; tympanum is indistinct, only barely visible on its anteroventral portion, and concealed posterodorsally by a low supratympanic bulge formed by the superficial slip of 
m. depressor mandibulae
; tympanum is positioned closely behind eye and lower, close to the angle of jaws; teeth present on maxillary arch; vocal slits large, arched from midlevel of tongue to anterior to the angles of jaws; tongue is short, oval, and half-free posteriorly.
</p>
            <p>
Hand has a moderate size (
27.6
% SVL); relative lengths of adpressed fingers are III&gt; I&gt; II&gt; IV; discs of all fingers are slightly expanded, horizontally oval; 
FIII
disc is barely wider than distal end of adjacent phalanx; the base of palm has a large, rounded palmar tubercle; and on base of FI there is a smaller (approximately 
1
/ 
3
of the palmar tubercle), oval thenar tubercle; one or two subarticular tubercles on fingers (one each on FI and FII, two each on 
FIII
and FIV, the distal one of FIV inconspicuous); and all tubercles are flat and round or oval; without supernumerary tubercles. Fringes on fingers are low and indistinct on FI and 
FIII
of right hand (well preserved), and very notable on all fingers of left hand except FI (somewhat dehydrated). However, we think that these differences are obviously due to preservation and consider them of somehow doubtful validity for taxonomy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>Hind
limbs are of moderate length, SL = 
51.1
% of SVL; relative lengths of adpressed toes are IV&gt; III&gt; V&gt; II&gt; I; TI is moderately long, the tip reaching the mid-subarticular tubercle of TII; toe discs are moderately expanded, TIV about 
1.8
times wider than distal end of adjacent phalanx; feet are basally webbed; fringes on toes are present but low; one to three are non-protuberant and small subarticular tubercles are present (one on TI and TII, two on 
TIII
and TV, three on TIV, proximal one almost indistinct); two metatarsal tubercles are present, including a small oval outer, and a similar in size elongated inner tarsal tubercle; on right foot there is a mid-tarsal tubercle (lacking on left foot), this tubercle is double size of the two others; tarsal keel is well-defined, thick, straight, and transverse across tarsus, located from the proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to mid-tarsus; cloacal opening is located at upper level of thighs, with a short tube flap or anal sheath.

            <p>Color.
The specimen in life had its dorsum patternless dark brown except for the interorbital area where it was paler irregular with diffuse markings (

A). Two golden cream dorsolateral stripes are present from the tip of snout through the canthus rostralis and over the eyelid to the sacral area. Flanks are blackish brown immediately inferior to the dorsolateral stripes, including the loreal region; flanks below the dark brown area present a pale grey coloration with a diffuse to whitish spotting. The oblique lateral stripe is evidenced by diffuse spots ranging from yellow at the inguinal zone to dirty white for the remaining of the stripe. The length of the oblique lateral stripe begins at the inguinal zone and ends at mid flank. The upper lips are dark grey with striking white irregular large spots. Arms are greyish brown, with a pale cream area on the upper insertion of the arm, and they have a diffuse dark brown longitudinal stripe on the anterior side of the arm. Fingers are uniformly grey. 
Hind
limbs are pale brown in their dorsal side and ornamented with darker crossbars.
</p>
            <p>
After preservation, the 
holotype
presents some evident coloration changes. The dorsolateral stripes became strikingly white and the crossbars are clearly visible on both arms and hind limbs. On the ventral side, the specimen presents a dark brown reticulation on throat and chest while the belly remained white. Palms and plants are pale grey in coloration.
</p>
            <p>Variation.
Preserved specimens appear to have smooth skin, while living animals have shagreen to granular dorsal and lateral skin (

C). Some color variation is evidenced on the granules of the thighs and some of them are white in coloration. The dorsal pattern observed in the 
holotype
is similar as in three other males (
CVULA
8299, 8311- 
12
) though the pale dorsolateral stripes are much more evident on the 
holotype
. Variation was observed and some males are paler (orange brown in life) dorsally, with less marked crossbars on the limbs (
CVULA
8306, 8308, 
8310
and 
8305
). On 
CVULA
8299, 8308 and 
8311
, the dorsolateral stripes are ill-defined. Females are slightly larger in SVL than males, with 
6
of 
8
specimens

having a dark brown dorsal background with only one specimen (
CVULA8303
) having well-defined dorsolateral stripes. All specimens have a oblique lateral stripe ranging from more or less defined to a ill-defined by a series of white spots (

A). A vocal sac is evident on the male 
CVULA8299
. Ventrally, the coloration of this species is sexually dimorphic. Breeding males usually have dark throats but a more whitish belly with some variation. For example, the 
holotype
and 
CVULA
8299, 8311, and 
8312
have their chins, throats, and chests strongly to diffusely reticulated, 
CVULA8306
has a diffusely spotted throat, and 
CVULA
8305, 8308 and 
8310
have dirty white coloration (with only a profusion of melanophores on the chin under magnification). Females also present some variation in their chin and throat coloration ranging from uniformly dirty white (
CVULA8313
- 
14
) or little spotted (
CVULA8300
) to evidently irregular markings without reticulation as in 
CVULA8303
-04, 
8301
-02.
</p>
            <p>
In life, the dorsal coloration can be dark brown to orange brown, and without pattern to one consisting of small dark brown spots with paravertebral distribution. The dorsolateral stripes can be white, pale yellow to orange (

B). Ventrally, all specimens photographed are pale grey on the throat, immaculate white on the belly; the inguinal area, the thighs and shanks are pale yellow (

D). The anal sheath is evident in the 
holotype
and 
CVULA
8308, 8305, 
8310
, and 
8299
; but it is not evident in the males 
CVULA
8306, 8311- 
12
. The anal sheath is also present in females except on 
CVULA8301
and 
8314
. The anal sheath was found to be variable and most likely caused by preservation artifacts (

et al.

2006

            <p>Distribution and natural history.
We found four populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
(

). The topotypic population is located on a deep creek outside the small village of Los Ranchos, with males calling from the leaf litter, and females in close proximity. However, the frogs were never seen directly in the creek, which suggest that this species is riparian. All individuals were active during the day. Several small tadpoles were seen but not captured in small pools in the creek. One juvenile of 
<tp:taxon-name>Scinax manriquei
Barrio-Amoros, Chacon &amp; Orellana, 
2004</tp:taxon-name>
, was also seen in the same location.
</p>
            <p>
Another close population of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
was discovered in a different habitat in the locality of Santa Cruz de Mora via Los Ranchos. This collection site is an open stream within a deciduous forest, where other species of dendrobatid are present (
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne collaris
, 

Barrio-Amorós 
et al.2010
b
</tp:taxon-name>
). The three individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
collected there were found on the forest floor or close to tree roots along the banks of a stream. Remarkably, these 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
were not as agile as 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne</tp:taxon-name>
and much easier to collect. Along the stream, several large individuals of fishing spiders (
<tp:taxon-name>Sparassidae</tp:taxon-name>
) were seen syntopically with both 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. collaris</tp:taxon-name>
. CBA has seen events of predation by these spiders on 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne</tp:taxon-name>
and they might also prey on 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
.

            <p>
A third population of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
is present at the lower mountain forest along the road from La Azulita to 
Santa Elena
de Arenales, where males can be heard from forests along the road from La Palmita to Olinda in rainy days. The fourth population of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
is located around Río Frío and its based on a single specimen. At this locality, the individual was found in a secondary forest close to a mountain stream flowing to Río Frío and sympatric with

            <p>Color of the series.
After preservation, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates zippeli</tp:taxon-name>
specimens have their dorsum very dark brown, with a little evident vertebral stripe made by small pale white spots, starting from the tip of snout to the sacrum. The two dorsolateral stripes are pale blue in life (appearing white in preservative) with small spots. Specimen flanks are black with an irregular oblique lateral stripe also made by small dirty white spots; some white spots are on the lowest part of the flanks, close to the paler ventral area. Arms are dark brown with fine irregular pale brown spotting. 
Hind
limbs are dark brown without definite crossbars; thighs are paler than shanks, all with irregular pale brown spotting. Ventrally, throat and chest grey are evenly spotted with a profusion of melanophores (only seen under magnification); belly is dirty white, with scattered melanophores, and a few indistinct (only possible to distinguish under microscope) bluish white spots. Palms and soles are dark brown.
</p>
            <p>
Coloration in life specimens 
(
based on living, not collected specimens and 
CVULA8341
) is as follows. The dorsum can be olive (

A), light to dark brown or even black, with an irregular pattern. Alternatively, the dorsum can have irregular spotting of dark brown over a light brown background or it can be brown over black (

B). Flanks are dark brown to black, always darker than the dorsum. The two light dorsolateral stripes can be pale yellow, golden, or olive; but are always paler than the dorsum and flanks. The ventrolateral stripe is absent. The oblique lateral stripe can be short, just in the inguinal area, or long, extending above the upper arms. This stripe is always formed by small bright white spots, than can be pale blue at midbody or above the upper arms. Arms and hind limbs have also a pale background with irregular dark spotting or crossbars. The most striking chromatic character of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates zippeli</tp:taxon-name>
is that any part of its dorsal body can be covered by small rounded bluish to white spots, especially in the flanks, dorsum (even over the dorsolateral stripes), upper lips and loreal region. Ventrally (

B) a subadult female (
CVULA8341
) was found to be patternless with a dirty yellow to dirty white background; a series of very diffuse small pale white spots were distinguished under magnification.
</p>
            <p>Variation.
Dorsal skin can be smooth to shagreen without tubercles, both in living and preserved specimens. Fringes on fingers and toes are present on all specimens. Tarsal keel in this species is indistinct in almost all specimens, but it is completely absent in 
CVULA8338
and 
8340
. Only 
CVULA8335
and 
8337
have what appears to be an anal sheath; this data agrees with 

Grant 
et al.
(
2006
)

, which prevented that this characteristic can be variable. 
CVULA8339
presented an extra toe on the left foot. The extra toe rises from the 
TIII
towards its superior side, being of the same length and having a small disc and fringes. This case of complete polydactylia is the second reported in Venezuelan dendrobatids, after a case of partial polydactylia on 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne riveroi</tp:taxon-name>
(

Barrio-Amorós 
et al.2010
c

). 
CVULA8334
has the last section of FII and III missing, showing the phalanges exposed.
</p>
            <p>
The color pattern variation was also present (

C). One individual (
CVULA8340
) has irregular dark blotches on dorsum; while the series 
CVULA8337
- 
38
are patternless dorsally and their dorsolateral stripes are thin but not made with spots. Crossbars are also variable from distinct (
CVULA
8332, 8335) to indistinct or ill-defined. Ventrally, males are usually darker than females. Male 
CVULA8333
is the darkest in coloration, 
CVULA8331
- 
32
are similar to the 
holotype
, and 
CVULA8336
is the ventrally paler in coloration. This last specimen appears to be white at first glance with some melanophores on the throat under magnification. Females of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates zippeli</tp:taxon-name>
have paler ventral surfaces, mostly whitish with few scattered melanophores on the throat.

Rivero (

described variation within 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
by confronting the 
type
specimen against a subadult (
UPRM5593
) also collected from the 
type
locality. However, the description provided in 

Rivero (
1978
)

does not allow us to unambiguously evaluate the variation among our referred series. Therefore, we provide a description of the variation only based on our referred series. Males have a SVL range of 
22–23.1 mm
, and females SVL range of 
22.9–26.9
based on three adult specimens of each sex. Body is slender, round to quadrangular in cross-section. Dorsal skin, including dorsal surfaces of hind limbs is smooth, shagreen to finely granular, without tubercles on the posterior part of the body in preservative. Ventral skin is smooth. Head is longer than wide, HeL = 
35.8–37.9
% SVL; HW = 
32.8–36.3
% SVL. On males, snout is truncated to pointed in profile. On females, snout is rounded to slightly pointed. Nares are situated laterally to the tip of snout; narial openings are barely visible when viewing the head from the front, not visible when viewing dorsally; and they are visible when viewing from a ventral perspective. Canthus rostralis is angular, the loreal region is almost flat; interorbital region is little wider than the upper eyelid. Snout is longer than ED. Only half of the tympanum is distinct and it is visible at its anteroventral portion but concealed posterodorsally by a low supratympanic bulge formed by the superficial slip of 
m. depressor mandibulae
. The tympanum is positioned closely behind eye and close to the angle of jaws. Teeth are present on maxillary arch. Vocal slits are short to long, arched from mid-level of tongue to the anterior angle of the jaws. The tongue is short, oval to triangular; it is half free posteriorly.

            <p>
Hand is of moderate size (
25–28.2
% SVL); relative lengths of adpressed fingers are III&gt; I&gt; II&gt; IV; discs of all fingers are weakly expanded, horizontally oval to round; 
FIII
is barely wider than distal end of adjacent phalanx, at its maximum point is 
1.3

TIII
and TV, three on TIV, proximal one almost indistinct); two metatarsal tubercles are present, including a small rounded outer, and a slightly larger oval inner tarsal tubercle; mid-tarsal tubercles are seldom seen; tarsal keel is well-defined, thick, straight, transverse across tarsus, from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to mid-tarsus, with an ending tubercle-like structure; cloacal opening is located at the upper level of thighs, with short tube flap or anal sheath.
</p>
            <p>Comparison with the original description.
When compared with the original description (

Rivero 
1978
), we found a few additional details that should be noted. First, 

Rivero (
1978
)

does not note a supratympanic bulge, but this characteristic varies depending on the preservation method. Second, Rivero also mention the presence of basal webbing between FII-III-IV, which is absent on the referred specimens examined (another character that can vary in preserved specimens). All the remaining characteristics described for the 
holotype
are among the variation seen in the new specimens collected.
</p>
            <p>Color.
The referred specimens in life have dorsa with pale to dark brown coloration, patternless or presenting irregular spotting; the dorsolateral stripes can be very distinct (

A) to ill-defined (

C), pale orange to dark brown. The flanks can have a narrow dark brown longitudinal band below the dorsolateral stripe or they can be completely dark brown to the ventral area. The oblique lateral stripe can be solid, diffuse, or almost absent (consisting in a few, irregular and indistinct dirty white spots in the inguinal zone, even not forming a real stripe). Upper lips are patternless. Arms and hind limbs can be pale orange or brown to dark brown, with darker well-defined to ill-defined crossbars. Ventrally, males are pale grey on the throat and chest, white on the belly, with some opaque yellow on the hind limbs (

B). Females are plain grey on the throat, dirty white on the belly (

D). Iris is bronze with black reticulation; iris ring is also bronze.
</p>
            <p>Preserved specimens have a minimal dichromatism slightly apparent ventrally on males, as they have darker throats (pale to dark grey), consisting of a profusion of melanophores under magnification. Females are all white (with a few melanophores under magnification). The rest of the body coloration is not dichromatic in both sexes, varying in being paler or darker, with well or ill-defined crossbars on hind limbs.</p>
            <p>Natural history.
We found all 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
associated to a slow flowing creeks surrounded by pastures (
type
locality), primary, and secondary forests (Rio Frio, Tamá). Several males were calling from exposed and concealed sites in the creek, such as on the top of rocks or behind small waterfalls. Some females were seen moving along the creek as well. All individuals were active during daytime.
</p>
            <p>Vocalization.
The analyzed call is a section of a trill that lasted several minutes. The call was recorded at 
22.5
ºC (water temperature) at early afternoon on the 

June

type
locality (see referred specimens). The analyzed section of the call has four duplets of notes (

), lasting 
2
sec. One to two duplets of notes are produced per second. The dominant frequency of the first pulse is slightly lower than the second. The first pulse has a dominant frequency range of 3437.0– 
3862.7

<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
specimens provided by

and we found it to be problematic. The information provided of the specimens 
ICN42512
-

is inaccurate as they are from two distinct and geographically distant localities on the western slopes of the Northern Andes of

. Moreover, it is not justified why all specimens are assigned to a single population from Bacar[a]sica (the name is misspelled as ‘Bucarsica’ in the original paper, 

Grant 
et al.2006
: 
242
). First, the locality information for the specimens 
ICN42512

4.8 km

<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
species most likely show restricted distributions with no more than 
60–70 km2
. Therefore, it is unclear to us if all these specimens correspond to a single species or even less if they are conspecific with 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
or even with 
<tp:taxon-name>A. tokuko</tp:taxon-name>
(see phylogenetic relationships below). Thus, we consider the presence of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Colombia
as highly unlikely, but closely related allies might be present.

            <p>
Our referred specimens are less than 
13 km
from the 
type
locality near Michelena. The original description 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis
(

Rivero 
1978
)
</tp:taxon-name>
indicates a collection site at an elevation of 
830 m
on the road from La Fria (elevation 
119 m
) to Michelena (elevation 
1230 m
) in Estado Táchira (
Venezuela
); this road is 
25 km
long. The locality of the 
CVULA8315
– 
20
specimens

are from the same road described by 

Rivero (
1978
)

, and about 
12.5 km
from the georeferenced 
type
locality. In consequence, we consider the 
CVULA8315
– 
20
series to be topotypic. The series 
CVULA8321
– 
24
from ‘Rio Frío, Tamá’ is about 
44 km
from 
type
locality. Therefore, according to our data, we consider 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
to be endemic to 
Venezuela
. However, we suggest a careful comparison of all 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

and our specimens with the 
typeUPRM5147
(University of 
Puerto Rico
) to further confirm our insights.

We found 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
to be well-nested in 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
(

). This suggests a relative recent extension and radiation of the 
<tp:taxon-name>saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
clade into Eastern Cordillera of 
Colombia
. 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

provided nuclear and mitochondrial sequences from a specimen identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
with the voucher number 
MUJ3726
from Cubará (
Colombia
: Boyacá). However, it is unclear if these authors actually identified the specimen as 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
as discussed on previous section. We found 
MUJ3726
to be closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. cannatellai</tp:taxon-name>
based on the 
12
S- 
16
S rRNA segment. At the moment, we suggest recognizing 
MUJ3726
as voucher from a different species and we restrict 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
only to the Venezuelan localities.

The taxonomic status of

         </title>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Colostethus inflexus</tp:taxon-name>
has a problematic taxonomic history. It was described by 

Rivero (
1978
)

, who collected two specimens that seemed different to him among many “ 
<tp:taxon-name>alboguttatus</tp:taxon-name>
”

from “EI Almogral” near Boca de Monte on the crossroad between La Grita-Bailadores and Pregonero roads (
Venezuela
, Estado Táchira) at 
3075 m
. Initially, Rivero considered that enough evidence supported 
<tp:taxon-name>C. inflexus</tp:taxon-name>
as a valid species, but later he considered that all specimens from EI Almogral were indeed of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates alboguttatus</tp:taxon-name>
and later 

Rivero (
1984
)

synonymized 
<tp:taxon-name>Colostethus inflexus</tp:taxon-name>
with 
<tp:taxon-name>A. alboguttatus</tp:taxon-name>
. However, as is currently known, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates alboguttatus</tp:taxon-name>
is endemic to northern Mérida city (

Rivero 
1961
; Barrio-Amorós 1998, 2004; 

La Marca 
2005
), at about 
100 km
NNE from the 
<tp:taxon-name>C. inflexus</tp:taxon-name>type
locality. All species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
show rather restricted distributions with no more than 
60–70 km2
(

La Marca 
2005
). Based on this precarious argument, we preliminary suggest that specimens assigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>C. inflexus</tp:taxon-name>
must be different from 
<tp:taxon-name>A. alboguttatus</tp:taxon-name>
and a proper comparison should be made. 

Rivero (
1976
)

also described 
<tp:taxon-name>Colostethus orostoma</tp:taxon-name>
from Boca del Monte, a locality close to the 
type
locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. inflexus</tp:taxon-name>
. Additionally, we reviewed a series of specimens (
CVULA3528
- 
29
) identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>A. orostoma</tp:taxon-name>
and they do not fit the ventral color pattern described by 

Rivero (
1976
)

. We suggest a more thorough comparison of the 
type
material along with new collections to resolve the status of 
<tp:taxon-name>C. inflexus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>A. orostoma</tp:taxon-name>
.

Description of the 
holotype
.

The 
holotype
is an adult male of 
21.7 mm
(

A): body slender, quadrangular in cross-section; dorsal skin, including dorsal surfaces of hind limbs, and smooth in preservative; ventral skin is smooth except on belly sides, where it is granular; its head is longer than wide, HeL = 
37.7
% of SVL; HW = 
33.6
% SVL; its snout is subacuminate in profile, inclined posteroventrally, rounded in dorsal and ventral view; its nares are situated laterally to the tip of snout; its narial openings are barely visible when viewing the head from the front, they are not visible from the dorsal side, and visible when viewing from the ventral aspect; its canthus rostralis is sloping, the loreal region is flat; interorbital region is little wider than the upper eyelid; snout longer than ED; tympanum is indistinct, only barely visible on its anteroventral portion, and concealed posterodorsally by a low supratympanic bulge formed by the superficial slip of 
m. depressor mandibulae
; tympanum is positioned closely behind eye and lower, close to the angle of jaws; teeth present on maxillary arch; vocal slits large, arched from midlevel of tongue to anterior to the angles of jaws; tongue is short, oval, and half-free posteriorly.
</p>
            <p>
Hand has a moderate size (
27.6
% SVL); relative lengths of adpressed fingers are III&gt; I&gt; II&gt; IV; discs of all fingers are slightly expanded, horizontally oval; 
FIII
disc is barely wider than distal end of adjacent phalanx; the base of palm has a large, rounded palmar tubercle; and on base of FI there is a smaller (approximately 
1
/ 
3
of the palmar tubercle), oval thenar tubercle; one or two subarticular tubercles on fingers (one each on FI and FII, two each on 
FIII
and FIV, the distal one of FIV inconspicuous); and all tubercles are flat and round or oval; without supernumerary tubercles. Fringes on fingers are low and indistinct on FI and 
FIII
of right hand (well preserved), and very notable on all fingers of left hand except FI (somewhat dehydrated). However, we think that these differences are obviously due to preservation and consider them of somehow doubtful validity for taxonomy of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>Hind
limbs are of moderate length, SL = 
51.1
% of SVL; relative lengths of adpressed toes are IV&gt; III&gt; V&gt; II&gt; I; TI is moderately long, the tip reaching the mid-subarticular tubercle of TII; toe discs are moderately expanded, TIV about 
1.8
times wider than distal end of adjacent phalanx; feet are basally webbed; fringes on toes are present but low; one to three are non-protuberant and small subarticular tubercles are present (one on TI and TII, two on 
TIII
and TV, three on TIV, proximal one almost indistinct); two metatarsal tubercles are present, including a small oval outer, and a similar in size elongated inner tarsal tubercle; on right foot there is a mid-tarsal tubercle (lacking on left foot), this tubercle is double size of the two others; tarsal keel is well-defined, thick, straight, and transverse across tarsus, located from the proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to mid-tarsus; cloacal opening is located at upper level of thighs, with a short tube flap or anal sheath.

            <p>Color.
The specimen in life had its dorsum patternless dark brown except for the interorbital area where it was paler irregular with diffuse markings (

A). Two golden cream dorsolateral stripes are present from the tip of snout through the canthus rostralis and over the eyelid to the sacral area. Flanks are blackish brown immediately inferior to the dorsolateral stripes, including the loreal region; flanks below the dark brown area present a pale grey coloration with a diffuse to whitish spotting. The oblique lateral stripe is evidenced by diffuse spots ranging from yellow at the inguinal zone to dirty white for the remaining of the stripe. The length of the oblique lateral stripe begins at the inguinal zone and ends at mid flank. The upper lips are dark grey with striking white irregular large spots. Arms are greyish brown, with a pale cream area on the upper insertion of the arm, and they have a diffuse dark brown longitudinal stripe on the anterior side of the arm. Fingers are uniformly grey. 
Hind
limbs are pale brown in their dorsal side and ornamented with darker crossbars.
</p>
            <p>
After preservation, the 
holotype
presents some evident coloration changes. The dorsolateral stripes became strikingly white and the crossbars are clearly visible on both arms and hind limbs. On the ventral side, the specimen presents a dark brown reticulation on throat and chest while the belly remained white. Palms and plants are pale grey in coloration.
</p>
            <p>Variation.
Preserved specimens appear to have smooth skin, while living animals have shagreen to granular dorsal and lateral skin (

C). Some color variation is evidenced on the granules of the thighs and some of them are white in coloration. The dorsal pattern observed in the 
holotype
is similar as in three other males (
CVULA
8299, 8311- 
12
) though the pale dorsolateral stripes are much more evident on the 
holotype
. Variation was observed and some males are paler (orange brown in life) dorsally, with less marked crossbars on the limbs (
CVULA
8306, 8308, 
8310
and 
8305
). On 
CVULA
8299, 8308 and 
8311
, the dorsolateral stripes are ill-defined. Females are slightly larger in SVL than males, with 
6
of 
8
specimens

having a dark brown dorsal background with only one specimen (
CVULA8303
) having well-defined dorsolateral stripes. All specimens have a oblique lateral stripe ranging from more or less defined to a ill-defined by a series of white spots (

A). A vocal sac is evident on the male 
CVULA8299
. Ventrally, the coloration of this species is sexually dimorphic. Breeding males usually have dark throats but a more whitish belly with some variation. For example, the 
holotype
and 
CVULA
8299, 8311, and 
8312
have their chins, throats, and chests strongly to diffusely reticulated, 
CVULA8306
has a diffusely spotted throat, and 
CVULA
8305, 8308 and 
8310
have dirty white coloration (with only a profusion of melanophores on the chin under magnification). Females also present some variation in their chin and throat coloration ranging from uniformly dirty white (
CVULA8313
- 
14
) or little spotted (
CVULA8300
) to evidently irregular markings without reticulation as in 
CVULA8303
-04, 
8301
-02.
</p>
            <p>
In life, the dorsal coloration can be dark brown to orange brown, and without pattern to one consisting of small dark brown spots with paravertebral distribution. The dorsolateral stripes can be white, pale yellow to orange (

B). Ventrally, all specimens photographed are pale grey on the throat, immaculate white on the belly; the inguinal area, the thighs and shanks are pale yellow (

D). The anal sheath is evident in the 
holotype
and 
CVULA
8308, 8305, 
8310
, and 
8299
; but it is not evident in the males 
CVULA
8306, 8311- 
12
. The anal sheath is also present in females except on 
CVULA8301
and 
8314
. The anal sheath was found to be variable and most likely caused by preservation artifacts (

et al.

2006

            <p>Distribution and natural history.
We found four populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
(

). The topotypic population is located on a deep creek outside the small village of Los Ranchos, with males calling from the leaf litter, and females in close proximity. However, the frogs were never seen directly in the creek, which suggest that this species is riparian. All individuals were active during the day. Several small tadpoles were seen but not captured in small pools in the creek. One juvenile of 
<tp:taxon-name>Scinax manriquei
Barrio-Amoros, Chacon &amp; Orellana, 
2004</tp:taxon-name>
, was also seen in the same location.
</p>
            <p>
Another close population of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
was discovered in a different habitat in the locality of Santa Cruz de Mora via Los Ranchos. This collection site is an open stream within a deciduous forest, where other species of dendrobatid are present (
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne collaris
, 

Barrio-Amorós 
et al.2010
b
</tp:taxon-name>
). The three individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
collected there were found on the forest floor or close to tree roots along the banks of a stream. Remarkably, these 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
were not as agile as 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne</tp:taxon-name>
and much easier to collect. Along the stream, several large individuals of fishing spiders (
<tp:taxon-name>Sparassidae</tp:taxon-name>
) were seen syntopically with both 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>M. collaris</tp:taxon-name>
. CBA has seen events of predation by these spiders on 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne</tp:taxon-name>
and they might also prey on 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
            <p>
A third population of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
is present at the lower mountain forest along the road from La Azulita to 
Santa Elena
de Arenales, where males can be heard from forests along the road from La Palmita to Olinda in rainy days. The fourth population of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>
is located around Río Frío and its based on a single specimen. At this locality, the individual was found in a secondary forest close to a mountain stream flowing to Río Frío and sympatric with 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne urticans</tp:taxon-name>

            <p>Color of the series.
After preservation, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates zippeli</tp:taxon-name>
specimens have their dorsum very dark brown, with a little evident vertebral stripe made by small pale white spots, starting from the tip of snout to the sacrum. The two dorsolateral stripes are pale blue in life (appearing white in preservative) with small spots. Specimen flanks are black with an irregular oblique lateral stripe also made by small dirty white spots; some white spots are on the lowest part of the flanks, close to the paler ventral area. Arms are dark brown with fine irregular pale brown spotting. 
Hind
limbs are dark brown without definite crossbars; thighs are paler than shanks, all with irregular pale brown spotting. Ventrally, throat and chest grey are evenly spotted with a profusion of melanophores (only seen under magnification); belly is dirty white, with scattered melanophores, and a few indistinct (only possible to distinguish under microscope) bluish white spots. Palms and soles are dark brown.
</p>
            <p>
Coloration in life specimens 
(
based on living, not collected specimens and 
CVULA8341
) is as follows. The dorsum can be olive (

A), light to dark brown or even black, with an irregular pattern. Alternatively, the dorsum can have irregular spotting of dark brown over a light brown background or it can be brown over black (

B). Flanks are dark brown to black, always darker than the dorsum. The two light dorsolateral stripes can be pale yellow, golden, or olive; but are always paler than the dorsum and flanks. The ventrolateral stripe is absent. The oblique lateral stripe can be short, just in the inguinal area, or long, extending above the upper arms. This stripe is always formed by small bright white spots, than can be pale blue at midbody or above the upper arms. Arms and hind limbs have also a pale background with irregular dark spotting or crossbars. The most striking chromatic character of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates zippeli</tp:taxon-name>
is that any part of its dorsal body can be covered by small rounded bluish to white spots, especially in the flanks, dorsum (even over the dorsolateral stripes), upper lips and loreal region. Ventrally (

B) a subadult female (
CVULA8341
) was found to be patternless with a dirty yellow to dirty white background; a series of very diffuse small pale white spots were distinguished under magnification.
</p>
            <p>Variation.
Dorsal skin can be smooth to shagreen without tubercles, both in living and preserved specimens. Fringes on fingers and toes are present on all specimens. Tarsal keel in this species is indistinct in almost all specimens, but it is completely absent in 
CVULA8338
and 
8340
. Only 
CVULA8335
and 
8337
have what appears to be an anal sheath; this data agrees with 

Grant 
et al.
(
2006
)

, which prevented that this characteristic can be variable. 
CVULA8339
presented an extra toe on the left foot. The extra toe rises from the 
TIII
towards its superior side, being of the same length and having a small disc and fringes. This case of complete polydactylia is the second reported in Venezuelan dendrobatids, after a case of partial polydactylia on 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne riveroi</tp:taxon-name>
(

Barrio-Amorós 
et al.2010
c

). 
CVULA8334
has the last section of FII and III missing, showing the phalanges exposed.
</p>
            <p>
The color pattern variation was also present (

C). One individual (
CVULA8340
) has irregular dark blotches on dorsum; while the series 
CVULA8337
- 
38
are patternless dorsally and their dorsolateral stripes are thin but not made with spots. Crossbars are also variable from distinct (
CVULA
8332, 8335) to indistinct or ill-defined. Ventrally, males are usually darker than females. Male 
CVULA8333
is the darkest in coloration, 
CVULA8331
- 
32
are similar to the 
holotype
, and 
CVULA8336
is the ventrally paler in coloration. This last specimen appears to be white at first glance with some melanophores on the throat under magnification. Females of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates zippeli</tp:taxon-name>
have paler ventral surfaces, mostly whitish with few scattered melanophores on the throat.

<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
by confronting the 
type
specimen against a subadult (
UPRM5593
) also collected from the 
type
locality. However, the description provided in 

Rivero (
1978
)

does not allow us to unambiguously evaluate the variation among our referred series. Therefore, we provide a description of the variation only based on our referred series. Males have a SVL range of 
22–23.1 mm
, and females SVL range of 
22.9–26.9
based on three adult specimens of each sex. Body is slender, round to quadrangular in cross-section. Dorsal skin, including dorsal surfaces of hind limbs is smooth, shagreen to finely granular, without tubercles on the posterior part of the body in preservative. Ventral skin is smooth. Head is longer than wide, HeL = 
35.8–37.9
% SVL; HW = 
32.8–36.3
% SVL. On males, snout is truncated to pointed in profile. On females, snout is rounded to slightly pointed. Nares are situated laterally to the tip of snout; narial openings are barely visible when viewing the head from the front, not visible when viewing dorsally; and they are visible when viewing from a ventral perspective. Canthus rostralis is angular, the loreal region is almost flat; interorbital region is little wider than the upper eyelid. Snout is longer than ED. Only half of the tympanum is distinct and it is visible at its anteroventral portion but concealed posterodorsally by a low supratympanic bulge formed by the superficial slip of 
m. depressor mandibulae
. The tympanum is positioned closely behind eye and close to the angle of jaws. Teeth are present on maxillary arch. Vocal slits are short to long, arched from mid-level of tongue to the anterior angle of the jaws. The tongue is short, oval to triangular; it is half free posteriorly.

            <p>
Hand is of moderate size (
25–28.2
% SVL); relative lengths of adpressed fingers are III&gt; I&gt; II&gt; IV; discs of all fingers are weakly expanded, horizontally oval to round; 
FIII
is barely wider than distal end of adjacent phalanx, at its maximum point is 
1.3

FIII
and FIV); and all tubercles are flat to round or oval; without supernumerary tubercles. Fringes on fingers are mainly absent, but on some males and females can be present, they are low and indistinct on FII and 
FIII

TIII
and TV, three on TIV, proximal one almost indistinct); two metatarsal tubercles are present, including a small rounded outer, and a slightly larger oval inner tarsal tubercle; mid-tarsal tubercles are seldom seen; tarsal keel is well-defined, thick, straight, transverse across tarsus, from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to mid-tarsus, with an ending tubercle-like structure; cloacal opening is located at the upper level of thighs, with short tube flap or anal sheath.
</p>
            <p>Comparison with the original description.
When compared with the original description (

Rivero 
1978
), we found a few additional details that should be noted. First, 

Rivero (
1978
)

does not note a supratympanic bulge, but this characteristic varies depending on the preservation method. Second, Rivero also mention the presence of basal webbing between FII-III-IV, which is absent on the referred specimens examined (another character that can vary in preserved specimens). All the remaining characteristics described for the 
holotype
are among the variation seen in the new specimens collected.
</p>
            <p>Color.
The referred specimens in life have dorsa with pale to dark brown coloration, patternless or presenting irregular spotting; the dorsolateral stripes can be very distinct (

A) to ill-defined (

C), pale orange to dark brown. The flanks can have a narrow dark brown longitudinal band below the dorsolateral stripe or they can be completely dark brown to the ventral area. The oblique lateral stripe can be solid, diffuse, or almost absent (consisting in a few, irregular and indistinct dirty white spots in the inguinal zone, even not forming a real stripe). Upper lips are patternless. Arms and hind limbs can be pale orange or brown to dark brown, with darker well-defined to ill-defined crossbars. Ventrally, males are pale grey on the throat and chest, white on the belly, with some opaque yellow on the hind limbs (

B). Females are plain grey on the throat, dirty white on the belly (

D). Iris is bronze with black reticulation; iris ring is also bronze.
</p>
            <p>Preserved specimens have a minimal dichromatism slightly apparent ventrally on males, as they have darker throats (pale to dark grey), consisting of a profusion of melanophores under magnification. Females are all white (with a few melanophores under magnification). The rest of the body coloration is not dichromatic in both sexes, varying in being paler or darker, with well or ill-defined crossbars on hind limbs.</p>
            <p>Natural history.
We found all 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
associated to a slow flowing creeks surrounded by pastures (
type
locality), primary, and secondary forests (Rio Frio, Tamá). Several males were calling from exposed and concealed sites in the creek, such as on the top of rocks or behind small waterfalls. Some females were seen moving along the creek as well. All individuals were active during daytime.
</p>
            <p>Vocalization.
The analyzed call is a section of a trill that lasted several minutes. The call was recorded at 
22.5
ºC (water temperature) at early afternoon on the

Colombia
by 

Grant 
et al.
(
2006
)

and 

Anganoy-Criollo (
2012
)

from Departamentos of Norte de Santander, Boyacá and Cesar, respectively (

). However, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
is likely to be a Venezuelan endemic and the Colombian specimens might represent other species and closer to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. cannatellai</tp:taxon-name>
               <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sp. nov.</named-content>
as supported by our phylogeny (

and 

, see next section). For this reason, we revised the specimen information associated to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
specimens provided by 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

and we found it to be problematic. The information provided of the specimens 
ICN42512
- 
16
and 
33587
is inaccurate as they are from two distinct and geographically distant localities on the western slopes of the Northern Andes of 
Colombia
. Moreover, it is not justified why all specimens are assigned to a single population from Bacar[a]sica (the name is misspelled as ‘Bucarsica’ in the original paper, 

Grant 
et al.2006
: 
242
). First, the locality information for the specimens 
ICN42512
- 
16
corresponds to Corregimiento Pueblo Nuevo, Sitio El Reposo, 
4.8 km
on the road of Ocaña to Pueblo Nuevo (
8.2304
N

, 
73.3890
W

at ~ 
1560 m
). This locality is 
61 km
WNW of the Bacar[a]sica site provided by 

Grant 
et al.
(
2006
)

. Second, the data provided for the specimen 
ICN33587
corresponds only to the municipality and the following information is more accurate: 
25.3 km
by road from Sardinata at 
1040 m
, municipio Bacarasica, Norte de Santander. The approximate coordinates of 
ICN33587
are 
8.1326
N

and 
72.8960
W

with an uncertainty of at least 
3 km
.
</p>
            <p>
Grant 
et al

provided information of a third population that most likely is based on molecular data (no information is provided about specimen morphological identification). The voucher specimen is 
MUJ3726
(Museo de Historia Natural, Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, 
Colombia
) from Cubará, Fátima, Quebrada Gralanday in Boyacá on the eastern slopes of the Northern Andes of 
Colombia
, which is closer in our analysis to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. cannatellai</tp:taxon-name>
than to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
, although both species are nested in a “ 
<tp:taxon-name>saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
” clade. The approximate coordinates for the 
MUJ3726
specimen are 
6.8790
N

and 
72.1879
W

. The distance from the Cubará population to the two other northern populations in Norte de Santader is 
160–200 km
in straight line. Moreover, all localities of the 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
specimens from 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

are at least 
61
kms of distance from the approximate 
type
locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
provided by Rivero’s description near Michelena (
7.9676
N

and 
72.2612
W

) on the Mérida Andes. Specifically, Sardinata is at least 
61 km
W, Pueblo Nuevo is at least 
128 km
WNW, and Cubará is at least 
122 km
S from Michelena. 

Anganoy-Criollo (
2012
)

reported further extension in the distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>A.
cf. 
saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
from two new localities in the southernmost edge and western versant of the Sierra de Perijá at ~ 
133 km
northwest from Michelena 
type
locality. These two new localities are very close within the Departamento de Cesar, namely, El Gitano (near 
Rio de Oro
at approximately 
8.3166
N

, 
73.4167
W

) and San Cayetano (near Gonzales at approximately 
8.3931
N

, 
73.3844
W

). 

La Marca (
2005
)

, on the other hand, has suggested that 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
species most likely show restricted distributions with no more than 
60–70 km2
. Therefore, it is unclear to us if all these specimens correspond to a single species or even less if they are conspecific with 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
or even with 
<tp:taxon-name>A. tokuko</tp:taxon-name>
(see phylogenetic relationships below). Thus, we consider the presence of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Colombia
as highly unlikely, but closely related allies might be present.
</p>
            <p>
Our referred specimens are less than 
13 km
from the 
type
locality near Michelena. The original description 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis
(

Rivero 
1978
)
</tp:taxon-name>
indicates a collection site at an elevation of 
830 m
on the road from La Fria (elevation 
119 m
) to Michelena (elevation 
1230 m
) in Estado Táchira (
Venezuela
); this road is 
25 km
long. The locality of the 
CVULA8315
– 
20
specimens

are from the same road described by 

Rivero (
1978
)

, and about 
12.5 km
from the georeferenced 
type
locality. In consequence, we consider the 
CVULA8315
– 
20
series to be topotypic. The series 
CVULA8321
– 
24
from ‘Rio Frío, Tamá’ is about 
44 km
from 
type
locality. Therefore, according to our data, we consider 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
to be endemic to 
Venezuela
. However, we suggest a careful comparison of all 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

and our specimens with the 
typeUPRM5147
(University of 
Puerto Rico
) to further confirm our insights.
</p>
            <p>Phylogenetic relationships.
We found 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
to be well-nested in 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
(

). This suggests a relative recent extension and radiation of the 
<tp:taxon-name>saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
clade into Eastern Cordillera of 
Colombia
. 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

provided nuclear and mitochondrial sequences from a specimen identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
with the voucher number 
MUJ3726
from Cubará (
Colombia
: Boyacá). However, it is unclear if these authors actually identified the specimen as 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
as discussed on previous section. We found 
MUJ3726
to be closely related to 
<tp:taxon-name>A. cannatellai</tp:taxon-name>
based on the 
12
S- 
16
S rRNA segment. At the moment, we suggest recognizing 
MUJ3726
as voucher from a different species and we restrict 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
only to the Venezuelan localities.

and

(

, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ornatissimus</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
are recognized as extant. 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
species decline is apparently related to altitude as most extant species occur below an elevation of 
1000 m
(e.g.,

, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ericksonae</tp:taxon-name>

            <tp:taxon-name>Aromobates alboguttatus</tp:taxon-name>
was a species frequently encountered around Mérida city, at least until the 
1990
s. The senior author, along with parties of students of the Universidad de los Andes and other interested people, searched for it many times since 
1995
, with no success. 

Piñero &amp; La Marca (
1996
)

were the last to perform a natural history research on this species, using 
149
specimens

for a dietary study.
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Aromobates leopardalis</tp:taxon-name>
is a large species known from the páramo de Mucubají, where it was formerly abundant, as many jars of specimens are housed at the 
CVULA
evidence. In 

August 
1995
the senior author, accompanied by Amelia Diaz de Pascual, saw the last tadpoles and smelled the peculiar and deep skunk-like aroma of this species (possibly similar to that in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
). Since then, and despite of many searches in the area by different teams of herpetologists and students, no further specimens have been found. In 
2005
, a thorough search for 
<tp:taxon-name>Atelopus mucubajiensis</tp:taxon-name>
, a microsympatric species, was made (

Barrio-Amorós 
2009
b

); but no individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. leopardalis</tp:taxon-name>
were found.
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Aromobates mayorgai</tp:taxon-name>
was searched along with 
<tp:taxon-name>A. meridensis</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Atelopus carbonerensis</tp:taxon-name>
during 
2000–2008
by the senior author and collaborators. 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates mayorgai</tp:taxon-name>
was never found and it is considered extinct from its 
type
locality, Chorotal, Mérida, at 
1800 m
, and we suspect a severe decline could extirpate most if not all of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. mayorgai</tp:taxon-name>
populations.
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Aromobates meridensis</tp:taxon-name>
is a critically endangered frog, as the last census came up with an extremely worrying number: only 

56– 
129
adults remained in 
2006
at a site close to the 
type
locality, where it is now considered extinct (

Barrio-Amorós 
et al.2010
a

). Moreover, life specimens of this species were infected with 
Batrachochitrium dendrobatidis,
which has a worrisome prognosis (M. Lampo, pers. com.; 

Barrio-Amorós 
2009
c

).
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Aromobates nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
is the largest known dendrobatid, attaining an SVL of up to 
64 mm
. This species is also probably extinct, since searches for individuals of this species at its 
type
locality since 
1991
have been unsuccessful (Barrio-Amorós 
2001
). During a recent expedition by the senior author, no new specimens were found (Barrio- Amorós 
et al.2011
). However, a new species was discovered close to its 
type
locality (
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ornatissimus</tp:taxon-name>
) which might be syntopic and abundant at its restricted distribution area. This opens the possibility that 
<tp:taxon-name>A. nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
might still exist in this area.
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Aromobates zippeli</tp:taxon-name>
can be considered as one of the most endangered extant 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
, as its habitat is completely surrounded by agricultural fields where agrochemicals are frequently employed. We urge for an immediate census of this species and the identification of more populations for an urgent protection and monitoring plan. Even with no more data at hand, we suspect that the species is currently at high risk of extinction. We propose that the species be listed under category CR A 
2
abc+B 
1
ab(ii,iii,iv) of the 
IUCN
criteria (see

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>
In terms of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
phylogenetic history, this genus is positioned near the ‘crown’ of all extant species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Dendrobatidae</tp:taxon-name>
with an estimated divergence time in the late Oligocene (Santos 
et al.2009
). Given 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
age (i.e., ~ 
35
MYA), the restricted distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
is remarkable. Several factors might have contributed to 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
limited distribution including the complex orogeny of the northern Andes and the development of the Orinoco Basin (Díaz de 

Gamero 
1996
). The rise of the Andes and marine incursions from the Caribbean at the beginning of the Miocene might have contributed to 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
isolation starting in the Miocene-Pliocene boundary (

Manzanilla 
et al
. 
2009
; Santos 
et al.2009
). Historical biogeography of dendrobatids also supports this complex scenario and suggests an 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
recent radiation at 
16.960
± 
3.664
MYA (Santos 
et al.2009
). Therefore, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
might have originated on the shores of a paleo-Orinoco river system that ended with the formation of the current Maracaibo Lake system (

Hoorn 
et al.1995
).
</p>
         <p>
We described three new species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
as well as confirmed that 
<tp:taxon-name>A. saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
is present near its 
type
locality in 
Venezuela
. We suggest that the 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
populations known from 
Colombia
are at least one undescribed species and all them are members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
clade, but are not 
<tp:taxon-name>saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
            <named-content content-type="taxonStatus">sensu stricto</named-content>

<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
to

species.

         <p>
The most recent taxonomic and phylogenetic reviews of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
were provided by 

Grant 
et al.
(
2006
)

and Barrio-Amorós 
et al.
(
2011
). The only unambiguously optimized synapomorphies for this genus are molecular (

Grant 
et al
. 
2006
: page 
160
). However, several problems emerge with the diagnosis of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
using 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

criteria. First, the number species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
with molecular data used by them are only 
5
of the 
14
previously know species. Second, the number of sequences used to define molecular synapomorphies in 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
by 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

is uneven and ranged from 
1 to 9
genes. Specifically, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates molinari</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>A.
cf. 
zippeli</tp:taxon-name>
included only a small 
16
S rDNA ~ 
550
bp fragment gathered from the GeneBank, 
<tp:taxon-name>Nephelobates</tp:taxon-name>
sp

. WES 
626
(i.e.,

, see Barrio-Amorós 
et al.2011

<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates
aff. 
saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
have 
8
genes; and 
<tp:taxon-name>A. nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
have 
9
genes (~ 
6,000
bp). Third, most of the 
61
synapomorphies suggested by 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
: 
257
) are possible autopomorphies or synapomorphies of only one or two species of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
. Specifically, the distribution of synapormorphies are as follows, 
1
from the 
28
S gene (present in 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ornatissimus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>A. nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
), 
8
from cytochrome 
b
gene (present in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ornatissimus</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>A.
aff. 
saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
), 
47
from the H 
1
segment (supposedly present in all 
5
species, but this is not possible determine as 
2
species include only the short 
16
S rDNA fragment), 
1
from the RAG 
1
gene (present in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>A.
aff. 
saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
), and 
4
from the SIA gene (present in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ornatissimus</tp:taxon-name>
). Fourth, from the 
9
genes sequenced in 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
, only 
6
synapomorphies (i.e., 
6
/ 
6,000
or ~ 
0.10
% of all sites) were found in nuclear data while the reaming 
55
(i.e., 
55
/ 
6,000
or ~ 
0.92
% of all sites) came from the mitochondrial data. These observations suggest extremely low phylogenetic information in their nuclear markers and an overwhelming contribution by mitochondrial genes.
</p>
         <p>
Within the suggested mitochondrial synapormorphies, 
47
are present in steam-and-loop RNA genes (i.e., H 
1
: 
12
S, tRNA-Val, and 
16
S) and they represent 
72.3
% (i.e.,

apparently divided H 
1
segment into 
16
smaller fragments derived from an initial Clustal X (

Thompson 
et al
., 
1997
) alignment and provided a list of their unambiguously optimized synapormorphies within each fragment with a positional number. We tried without success to identify, which fragment corresponds to which section of the H 
1
and the actual lengths of each of the 
16
fragments are unknown. The reason is that the 

Grant 
et al
. 
2006
supplementary material includes two files (
1
) an unaligned 
FASTA
formatted sequences file ‘dendro_mt.poy’ with a ‘#’ indicating the limiting regions between fragments and (
2
) the actual POY alignment file ‘Grant_etal 
2006
_IA.ss’ which defines their homologous positions but it does not have such fragment identifiers. This data formatting renders the identification of H 
1
synapomorphies provided in Grant 
et al
. Appendix 
8
rather useless in its actual format. For us, this lack of clarity also reflects a well-known fact that mitochondrial ribosomal genes are very difficult to align (

Schloss 
2010
) and alignments are strongly dependent on the software and the starting parameters employed (

Morrison &amp; Ellis 
1997
). In spite of these, 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

used the POY alignment of the H 
1
segment to determine molecular synapomorphies for 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
and justified its validity by intuition and “strategic” used of the algorithms of POY (

Grant 
et al
. 
2006
: page 
48
). However, several simulation studies have showed that POY based alignments are strongly dependent on starting parameters, inferior to ML approaches (

Ogden &amp; Rosenberg 
2007
), and less accurate to inferred phylogenies (

Strugnell &amp; Nishiguchi 
2007
). For all these reasons, it is nearly an impossible task to determine from the 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

H 
1
POY alignment if their diagnostic synapomorphies are truly homologous. Finally, the H 
1
segment has not been thoroughly explored in dendrobatids for several of the common problems with mitochondrial markers (e.g., introgression and incomplete lineage sorting). These problems might affect taxonomic conclusions drawn from mtDNA gene trees (

Funk &amp; Omland 
2003
). In consequence, we suggest that 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

molecular synapormorphies based on H 
1
should not be used for taxonomic characterization of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
or other any genera within 
<tp:taxon-name>Dendrobatidae</tp:taxon-name>
(i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>Dendrobatidae</tp:taxon-name>
+ 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aromobatidae sensu 

Grant 
et al
. 
2006</tp:taxon-name>
).
</p>
         <p>
In the present study, we could also have adventured in providing more diagnostic molecular synapomorphies based on H 
1
segment (i.e., 
12
S and 
16
S rDNA mitochondrial genes) which was used to construct our phylogeny of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
. However, we feel that it is a disservice to the community to perpetuate or even extend the use H 
1
alignments as source of synapomorphies without a clear idea of homology. In contrast, we do provide some molecular diagnostic characters based on two nuclear markers derived from unambiguous alignments of exons (

Table 
2
). More molecular data from 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
are needed to fully characterize the molecular diversity of this lineage.
</p>
         <p>
Within the morphological characters that diagnose 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
, we found several additional problems with 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

criteria: pages 
160–161
and further referred in 

Lötters 
et al
. (
2007
)

: page 
49
. First, we found that some morphological characters are rather ambiguous and uninformative. For example, character 
2
of 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

indicates that pale oblique lateral stripe could be either present or absent, character 
6
indicates that toe webbing could be from basal to extensive, and character 
8
indicates that finger I could be either shorter than, equal to, or longer than finger II. These characters include all possible variations found in 
<tp:taxon-name>Dendrobatidae</tp:taxon-name>
(i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>Dendrobatidae</tp:taxon-name>
+ 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aromobatidae sensu 

Grant 
et al
., 
2006</tp:taxon-name>
) and are uninformative at the genus level. Second, some diagnostic characters become uninformative as their states are evaluated across 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
. For example, character 
3
of 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

indicates that a pale dorsolateral stripe is present; however, we found that this character state is not always present and at least four species lack this character state (
<tp:taxon-name>A. leopardalis</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. meridensis</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>A. nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>A. ornatissimus</tp:taxon-name>
). Other example is character 
7
on the morphology of the third finger of adult males indicated as not swollen. However, 

Barrio-Amorós 
et al.
(
2010
a)

stated that 
<tp:taxon-name>A. meridensis</tp:taxon-name>
has 
FIII
swollen in males during reproductive periods, a characteristic that might be present on other congenerics. Third, 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

does not discuss some very relevant autopomorphies of the 
type
species, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
. For example, the noxious mercaptan-like odor or the presence of 
adductor mandibulae externus superficialis
muscle present in 
<tp:taxon-name>A. nocturnus</tp:taxon-name>
. However, we report here that 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates leopardalis</tp:taxon-name>
might also have noxious mercaptan-like odor when handled, suggesting that this might be a diagnostic character in some 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
. Similarly, 
adductor mandibulae externus superficialis
was included in the 

Lötters 
et al
. (
2007
)

diagnosis of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
and might be a useful diagnostic character. Fourth, 

Grant 
et al
. (
2006
)

included a character present in a single species and this species was not evaluated for any other character (i.e., molecular or morphological). Specifically, character 
15
indicates that the chromosome number for 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
is 
2n
= 
24
based only on the karyotype of 
<tp:taxon-name>A. leopardalis</tp:taxon-name>
. We do not know more reports on chromosome number in 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
and this character should be considered with caution.
</p>
         <p>
Phylogenetic studies have provided an excellent tool to identify new species and phylogenetic relationships within 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Dendrobatidae</tp:taxon-name>
in a larger extent. However, we reiterate that the search for morphological, behavioral, physiological, and genomic synapomorphies that define 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
is far from complete. We clarify that at the core of our criticisms are not to restrain and hinder taxonomic advance, but proper generic diagnosis. We think is not enough to find well-supported clades to coin generic names. As represented here in 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
, molecular phylogenies support its monophyly, but we still much ignorant of what defines 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
. The only unambiguous synapomorphies of this clade are molecular, and among them we still are unsure which ones are truly homologous with the exception of a handful derived from nuclear markers. We hope future revisions of dendrobatid taxonomy will deliver those “unambiguously optimized synapomorphies” which will make generic definitions stable and trustworthy.
</p>
         <p>
We found 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
to be monophyletic and sister to 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne</tp:taxon-name>
as in previous studies (

Vences 
et al.2003
; 

Grant 
et al.2006
; 

Santos &amp; Cannatella 
2011
; 

Santos 
2012
). Within 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
, two lineages were evidenced including (
1
) 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates ornatissimus</tp:taxon-name>
with a distinctive larger branch length (i.e., number substitutions accumulated over time) and (
2
) a more inclusive 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
radiation with a southwestern distribution. Our phylogenetic tree supports a progression of the dendrobatid radiation of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne</tp:taxon-name>
from northeast to southwest of the Cordillera de Mérida along the Venezuelan Andes. Therefore, our phylogenies suggest a biogeographic pattern for 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
that parallels that of 
<tp:taxon-name>Mannophryne</tp:taxon-name>
.

Both lineages seemed to have followed a pattern of dispersal and diversification along the rise of Cordillera de Mérida and formation of the modern Orinoco Basin (

Manzanilla 
et al.2009
; Díaz de 

Gamero 
1996
). Furthermore, the phylogenetic position of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
unnamed species from 
Colombia
suggests a relative recent (i.e., Pliocene) radiation of this genus into the northernmost extreme of the Cordillera Oriental of 
Colombia
.
</p>
         <p>
            <tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
is mainly a Venezuelan endemic genus with three populations of at least one unknown species in northeastern 
Colombia
. Within its distribution, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates</tp:taxon-name>
is mainly endemic to the Cordillera de Mérida, from where the vast majority of species is known (
15
of 
17
species). However, members of this genus occur at the northeasternmost edge of the Northern Andes of 
Colombia
(i.e., Cordillera Oriental) where it enters 
Venezuela
(
<tp:taxon-name>Aromobates saltuensis</tp:taxon-name>
), and at the eastern versant of the Serranía de Perijá (
<tp:taxon-name>A. tokuko</tp:taxon-name>
; 

Rojas-Runjaic 
et al.2011
). For us is not surprising that new species such as 
<tp:taxon-name>A. tokuko</tp:taxon-name>
are being discovered and many more could exist on the western slopes of the Perijá. Only describing amphibian diversity will provide enough leverage for promoting conservation initiatives in such megadiverse regions as the Venezuelan and Colombian Andes
