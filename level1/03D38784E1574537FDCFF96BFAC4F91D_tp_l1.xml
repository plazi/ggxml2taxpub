         <tp:taxon-name>
Oplognathus
</tp:taxon-name>
was described by 
MacLeay (1819)
without ‘H’ at the beginning of the name, but later 
Burmeister (1844)
redescribed the genus as “ 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hoplognathus
</tp:taxon-name>
”, justifying that it would be the correct spelling for the name. 
Lacordaire (1856)
also pointed the “error” of MacLeay, and uses 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hoplognathus
</tp:taxon-name>
as a valid name, indicating “ 
Aplognathus
” as original wrong spelling, but not specifying the cause of the error. Since then, the name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hoplognathus
</tp:taxon-name>
has been widely used, including the description of the new species, generating more synonyms, such as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hoplognathus bahianus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hoplognathus helmenreichi
</tp:taxon-name>
. Only 
Machatschke (1970)
comments that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hoplognathus
</tp:taxon-name>
is a synonym, but when using 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oplognathus
</tp:taxon-name>
, the spelling appears as “ 
Oplongnathus
”. Already in his catalogue, 
Machatschke (1972)
cites “ 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oplognathus
</tp:taxon-name>
” using the original spelling, which proves to be a typing error in the previous publications. 
Ratcliffe &amp; Jameson (1989)
note this fact and show the correct use “ 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oplognathus
MacLeay
</tp:taxon-name>
(not 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hoplognathus
</tp:taxon-name>
as in 
Burmeister 1844
; 
Ohaus 1918
, 
1934
; 
Blackwelder 1944
)”, because according to Article 23 (ICZN 1999), the Principle of Priority, the oldest name should be used. In the original description, 
MacLeay (1819)
does not detail the etymology of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oplognathus
</tp:taxon-name>
, but the Hoplo prefix, from the Greek Hoplon, means ‘any tool or implement of armour and shield’ while Gnathus, from the Greek, means ‘mandible, mouth’, possibly due to the distinct shape of the clypeus of the males. Perhaps, this explains the insistence of later authors (
Burmeister 1844
; 
Lacordaire 1856
) to use the spelling 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hoplognathus
</tp:taxon-name>
, instead of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oplognathus
</tp:taxon-name>
, as correct. However, as there is no written indication of this, and the addition of ‘H’ is not a clear, obvious and necessary correction of the name, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oplognathus
</tp:taxon-name>
must be maintained, following the original description and not its subsequent spelling (ICZN 1999, Art. 33).
</p>
      <p>
Although Burmeister corrected the name of the genus, this does not mean that Ohaus intended to describe 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oplognathus bahianus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oplognathus helmenreichi
</tp:taxon-name>
in a genus other than 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oplognathus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Thus, the author’s name is written here without brackets, since the species is basically in its original combination.
</p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Oplognathus kirbii
</tp:taxon-name>
was cited by 
Laporte (1840)
as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oplognathus kirbyi
</tp:taxon-name>
and since then, both spellings were widely used, in addition to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hoplognathus kirbii
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hoplognathus kirbyi
</tp:taxon-name>
, it is common to find four spellings for this species throughout the literature. There are no details for replacing ‘i’ with ‘y’, but we can suppose 
Laporte (1840)
to make this change on the assumption that MacLeay intended to honour the naturalist William Kirby. ICZN (1999, Article 58.2) states that the use of ‘i’ and ‘y’ are ‘variant spellings’ deemed to be identical. However, as 
MacLeay (1819)
makes the description with no detail about etymology, it is prudent to keep the original spelling 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oplognathus kirbii
</tp:taxon-name>
and not to use the subsequent spellings (ICZN 1999, Art. 33).
</p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Oplognathus helmenreichi
</tp:taxon-name>
was described for the first time based on a single specimen in the collection of W.J.C. Weber by 
Ohaus (1905)
with this spelling (for the specific epithet) and the locality 
Buenos Aires
, 
Argentina
. Later, Ohaus wrote that he found (
Ohaus 1914a: 22
) several specimens of this species in the Museum of Vienna, but he described them as a variety “ 
<tp:taxon-name>
var. 
maculicollis
</tp:taxon-name>
”. These specimens were labelled “Helmr.”, realizing that the name of the collector was Helmreichen and not Helmenreich, as published in 
Ohaus (1905)
. Although 
Ohaus (1914a)
has described the variety as “ 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hoplognathus helmreicheni
var. 
maculicollis
</tp:taxon-name>
” in the original publication, the correct name is 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hoplognathus helmenreichi
var. 
maculicollis
</tp:taxon-name>
(as written on the original label). In this case, 
Ohaus (1914a)
made an unjustified emendation almost 10 years after the original publication of the species, not being recognized by the Code to validate a name (ICZN 1999, Art. 19.1, 33.2). Still, the latter spelling is used as valid, violating the Principle of Priority (ICZN 1999, Art. 23.9).
