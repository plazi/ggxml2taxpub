Description
</p>
      <p>
Adult female
</p>
      <p>
Body broadly oval, up to 
4 mm
long, covered by solid wax plates (
Fig. 1
). Antennae 9-segmented, covered by flagellate setae of different sizes; some of the antennal segments bearing minute setae, which represent, probably, any kind of sensilla. Legs normally developed; trochanter with 3 sensilla on each face; claw without denticle; claw digitules short, setose. Mouthparts well developed. Thoracic spiracles with spiracularia. Abdominal spiracles numbering 7 pairs, located along abdominal margin on dorsum; each abdominal spiracle with unilocular atrium, without wax pores inside or just near spiracular atrium. Anal apparatus represented by a short tube with internal sclerotized anal ring. Fifteen round cicatrices forming semicircle on abdominal sternites. With four main 
types
of discoidal wax glands: 1) variable pores (each about 7–10 μm in diameter) with stalked centre and with 2–5 peripheral loculi, scattered on all body surface, but more numerous in marginal zone of venter; 2) usual multilocular pores (each about 10 μm in diameter), with round or oval central loculus and 10–12 peripheral loculi, grouped around anal opening on dorsum, around vaginal opening on venter and scattered in medial and submedial zone of abdominal sternites; 3) irregular multilocular pores (each about 7–10 μm in diameter), with irregular central loculus and 6–10 peripheral loculi, forming group around anal opening on dorsum, group around vaginal opening on venter and scattered in medial and submedial zone of abdominal sternites; 4) simple pores (each about 2 μm in diameter), scattered in medial zone of ventral thorax. Conical setae very numerous, with more or less lanceolate apices, scattered on all dorsum and in marginal zone of venter. Flagellate setae of different size and thickness numerous in medial and submedial zone of ventral cephalothorax, on abdominal sternites. Long hair-like setae sparsely scattered on dorsum and in marginal zone of venter among conical setae.
