); (2) tarsal tubercle absent (
Fig. 2D
); (3) gular region and chest predominantly yellow in live individuals, pale cream in preserved specimens (
Figs 1B
, 
3B–C
); (4) belly with dark vermiculation pattern on a pale cream, slightly bluish background in live individuals (
Figs 1B
, 
3C
); (5) lack of aposematic coloration on ventral surface of hand and foot in live individuals (
Fig. 3C
); (6) intermediate size within the 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. signifer
</tp:taxon-name>
clade (adult male SVL = 
17.4–21.5 mm
,

<tp:taxon-name>
Physalaemus cuvieri
</tp:taxon-name>
clade (sensu 

Lourenço

) by simultaneously having (1) the presence of an arrow-shaped blotch on the dorsum of the body and (2) absence of tarsal tubercle (

Leal

<tp:taxon-name>
P. signifer
</tp:taxon-name>
clade (gular region and chest predominantly dark brown in live and preserved individuals of those species). Additionally, live individuals of

Etymology
</p>
      <p>
The specific epithet ʻ 
<tp:taxon-name>
araxa
</tp:taxon-name>
ʼ, is the combination of the Tupi-Guarani indigenous language words ʻaraʼ (meaning ʻworldʼ) and ʻeçaʼ (meaning ʻto seeʼ) meaning ʻthe first place where the sun can be seenʼ, in reference to the sunshine view on the top of hills (
Chiaradia 2008
). Also used to indicate the highest mountain in a landscape. That is the specific case of the 
type
locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Physalaemus araxa
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
, found on the mountaintop of the highest hill of the Atlantic forest.

In preservative (
Figs 1–2
), dorsal background color of the body, head, and limbs dark brown. All dorsal blotches dark brown, darker than background color. Interorbital blotch triangular-shaped, one vertex over each eyelid, the third vertex connected with the tip of an arrow-shaped blotch medially located on the dorsum of the body. Middle of the arrow-head with a small light spot, posterior portion of the arrow extends transversely towards each inguinal gland. Urostyle region bears a longitudinal blotch with anterior margin poorly defined, centered by a longitudinal light blotch. Some poorly defined and irregularly shaped small blotches scattered through dorsal surfaces of head and body. Inguinal gland ca 90% covered by a black ocellus. Dorsal surfaces of thigh, tibia, and foot with transversal blotches. Many white dots scattered throughout dorsal surface of body and limbs, mainly outlining the more distinct blotches and the black ocelli over the inguinal gland. Heel, anterior part of knee, and forearm with a black blotch. Upper arm with a longitudinal black blotch covering its posterior surface and the elbow. Dorsolateral black blotches, dorsally outlined by small white dots, extending from the posterior margin of the eye through the supra tympanic fold and reaching the second third of the flank. Elongated black blotches extends from the tip off the snout to the eye, passing over the nostril and canthus rostralis. Irregularly shaped black blotches on the loreal region and upper lip. Region between eyes and the insertion of the arms, pale cream. Ventral surfaces of the limbs brown with scattered light spots; ventrolateral edge of forearm with a black blotch over glandular tissue. Black blotch above the cloaca, dorsally outlined by small white spots, curved down toward the back of the thighs. Gular region and chest predominantly pale cream, stained with very small dark dots.

Color in life

      <p>
Gular region, chest, axillary region, lower border of anterior half of the flanks, and region between eyes and the insertion of the arms yellow (

Fig. 3A, C–D
). Ventral surface of limbs pinkish brown (
Fig. 3C
). Background color of belly pale cream, slightly bluish (

Variation
</p>
      <p>
Measurements and proportions of 
13 adult
males are presented in 
Table 1
. In life, color of dorsal background of head, body, and limbs may vary from pale yellow to dark brown; some individuals had these areas, as well as the region between eyes and the insertion of the arms, stained by pinkish coloration in different levels of area size and color intensity. Yellow coloration present on gular region, chest, axillary region, lower border of anterior half of the flanks, and the region between eyes and the insertion of the arms may vary in intensity. Ventral surface of thigh may be pinkish. White dots outlining dorsal blotches may vary in size and number, forming distinct lines in some individuals; these white dots/lines may be greenish in live individuals. Few individuals have dorsal pattern weakly distinct in life and in preservative. Dorsal arrow-shaped blotch may present interruptions and be slightly irregularly shaped. Irregularly shaped small blotches scattered across dorsal surfaces of head and body may vary in number, size, shape, position, and distinctness from the background. Background color of belly may be bluish in different intensities. Brown coloration of the ventral border of mandible is more visible in fixed specimens, after the yellow coloration has faded. In fixed specimens it varies from occupying just the edge of the mandible to the anterior half of gular region. Tympanum may be slightly discernible externally in some individuals. Snout may be rounded in lateral view. Dorsum of the head, body, thighs, and tibiae may be slightly rugose. Dark superficial keratinized layer of the nuptial pad may be peeled; however, nuptial pad remains visible.

Advertisement and aggressive call
</p>
      <p>
We identified two call 
types
, the advertisement and an aggressive call (of undetermined specific function, see 

Toledo 
et al.
2015

). Both the advertisement (n = 386 calls from seven individuals) and aggressive calls (n = 43 calls from four individuals) presented a pulsed structure. They differentiate from each other mainly by the call duration, note rate, and the context in which the recordings were obtained (advertisement calls recorded in the field and aggressive calls recorded from the aqua-terrarium). The advertisement calls had variable number of notes (1–3), frequency, and amplitude of notes varying in the call (
Fig. 4
; 
Table 2
). These calls seemed to be composed of a harmonic structure, but the harmonics were not clear in most of the calls. The most common advertisement call structure was that with 3 notes (exhibited in 63.63% of calls, 34.1% had two notes and 2.27% had only one note) with the dominant frequency in the second note (48.64% of the calls, 35.13% of calls had the dominant frequency in the third note and 16.21% in the first note). This call was emitted at rate of 0.87–2.04 calls/second, lasting between 0.07 to 0.3 seconds, with a dominant frequency of 0.94–2.63 kHz (average of 1.7 kHz ± 0.31 SD). On the other hand, we analyzed 1306 aggressive call notes from 
four males
(
Fig. 5
; 
Table 3
). These calls were emitted by males close to other calling males, but it was not possible to determine a specific function (e.g., territorial, encounter or fighting calls). Aggressive calls were organized in groups of 9–118 notes, lasting 4.73–53.46 seconds, longer than advertisement calls, and with a dominant frequency of 1.59–2.30 kHz.

was the only anuran species found breeding at those high-altitude ponds (observation also corroborated by the autonomous recordings). After amplexus, pairs produced floating foam nests where eggs were laid. Two foam nests were collected on 
5 October 2017
. Ten days after, tadpoles started leaving the nests and at 12 November tadpoles reached the stage 25. We counted 187 tadpoles from those nests. Benthic exotrophic tadpoles (ecomorphological guild II: A:1 sensu 
Altig &amp; McDiarmid 1999
) were observed in the wild in 
October and December 2017
. Calling activity, foam nests, and tadpoles were registered between 
October 2017

December 2017
. Immediately metamorphosed froglets (with no evidence of tail), raised in captivity, had between 7.76 and

Males were found calling from the ground or on top of peat moss (
