<tp:taxon-name>
Ancylis mitterbacheriana
</tp:taxon-name>
on 
<tp:taxon-name>
Quercus pubescens
(MSNV)
</tp:taxon-name>
. The record of 
Aubert (1983)
consists of a single male collected in 
Liguria
(Passo Turchino). Although the specimen certainly belongs to the 
<tp:taxon-name>
difformis
</tp:taxon-name>
group, males of this group are indeterminable (
Horstmann 2012
), especially if not obtained together with the females by rearing. On the basis of the known host records and the biology of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. capitator
</tp:taxon-name>
(

Villemant 
et al.
2011

; 

Lucchi 
et al.
2017

; 

Scaramozzino 
et al.
2017

, 
2018
), we think that this record should be treated as doubtful as males cannot be reliably assigned to any species.
