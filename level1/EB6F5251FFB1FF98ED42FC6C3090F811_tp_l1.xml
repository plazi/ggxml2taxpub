Remarks
</p>
      <p>
Molecular studies carried out by 
Schuchert (2005)
to explore species boundaries within the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Coryne
</tp:taxon-name>
found that populations identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Coryne pusilla
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Mediterranean, 
Japan
and 
Korea
are genetically different from the Northeast Atlantic ones. Based on these results, 
Schuchert (2005
, 
2010
) indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. pusilla
</tp:taxon-name>
appears to be a species complex, an opinion also shared by 
Calder (2017)
.
</p>
      <p>
The material examined here is scarce and prevents us from giving a detailed description of the species. Nevertheless, we want to highlight that we found two size-classes of stenoteles: small (8.2–10.3× 
4.1– 5.5 µm
) and large (15.1–17.6 × 
10.3–11.8 µm
) ones. These measurements concur with those obtained by Millard (1975) from South African material, but they are clearly inferior to those reported from East and West Atlantic populations (see 
Schuchert 2001b
and 
Calder 2017
, respectively). These data suggest that the Southeast Atlantic populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. pusilla
</tp:taxon-name>
could also represent a different species.

Distribution
</p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Coryne pusilla
</tp:taxon-name>
is considered as a circumglobal species, although the records from 
Madagascar
and Kerguelen Islands (Millard 1975) and those from the Pacific Ocean (Millard 1975; 
Schuchert 2005
, 
2012
) are considered as uncertain. It was reported from 
South Africa
by Millard (1975). Its bathymetric range extends from the intertidal level to 
100 m
depth (
Hirohito 1988
).
