Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
The salient features of the new species include: tegmina (
Fig. 8
) with two transverse brown bands apically; inner side of gonostyli (
Fig. 10
) concave medially producing an angular production; anal tube in lateral view (
Fig. 10
) bifurcate with two curved hooks at apex, lateral margins bifurcate at apex in dorsal view (
Fig. 7
); aedeagus (
Figs 10, 12
) bifurcate, lower part bifurcate at apex.

Description
</p>
      <p>
MEASUREMENTS. Body length including tegmina: male 
2.90–3.11 mm
(N = 5), female 
3.10–3.21 mm
(N = 2).
</p>
      <p>
COLORATION. General color grayish white (
Figs 1–2
). Eyes blackish brown. Frons pale brown, with weak blackish stripe in middle. Clypeus and antenna pale brown. Vertex, pronotum and mesonotum with brown stripe in middle, pronotum and mesonotum with two yellowish-brown patches on both sides. Tegmina with longitudinal veins and adjacent parts of membrane with dark patterns, with two transverse brown bands apically. Wings waxy white with pale veins.
</p>
      <p>
HEAD AND THORAX. Head (
Figs 1
, 
5
) significantly narrower than pronotum. Vertex shorter in middle than wide at base (1: 2.32), posterior margin slightly convex, with two triangular posterolateral areolets widely separated from each other, not nearly approaching in middle line. Frons (
Fig. 6
) approximately rectangular, without median carina, longer in middle line than wide at widest portion (about 1.66: 1), lateral carinae with dense row of sensory pits along outer margin. Clypeus (
Fig. 6
) without lateral carinae, elevated medially, median carina present. Frontoclypeal suture nearly straight. Rostrum elongate, surpassing hind-coxae. Pronotum (
Fig. 5
) short, wider than maximum width of head (including eyes) (1.36:1), lateral carinae sinuate, median carina absent. Mesonotum (
Fig. 5
) about 4.08 × as long as pronotum in midline, with weak median carina. Tegmina (
Fig. 8
) broadened apically, longer than maximal width (2.02: 1). A2 of wing (
Fig. 9
) not reaching margin. Metatibiotarsal formula: (3+5)-7-5.
</p>
      <p>
MALE GENITALIA. Pygofer (
Figs 10–11
) in lateral view with dorsocaudal angle strongly produced; in caudoventral view, strongly concave medially, each side with finger-like process with hairs lateroapically, slightly curved outwardly. Anal tube stout (
Figs 7, 10
) in lateral view, bifurcate curved hooks at apex, ventral margin waved; in dorsal view, bifurcate, lateral margins bifurcate at apex, anal style sets near base. Aedeagus (
Figs 10, 12
) bifurcate in lateral view, almost as long as anal tube, lower part of aedeagus slightly blunt, bifurcate at apex. Gonostyli (
Figs 10–11
) in lateral view, slightly curved at middle, inner side concave medially producing angular production; in caudoventral view, near middle to apex much narrower than other part, curved inwards with two bumps.

This species is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Eponisiella gramina

</tp:taxon-name>
); (2) anal tube in lateral view branched at apex (anal tube in lateral view unbranched at apex in
