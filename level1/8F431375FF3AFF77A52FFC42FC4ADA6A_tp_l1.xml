Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
This species may be separated from other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Charinus
</tp:taxon-name>
in Oceania as follows: aside from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. papuanus
</tp:taxon-name>
, the only other charinid species in the region in which the first tarsal article of leg I is as long as the sum of the next five articles is 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. pescotti
</tp:taxon-name>
, from which 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. papuanus
</tp:taxon-name>
can be distinguished by the number of dorsal spines on the pedipalp femur. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Charinus papuanus
</tp:taxon-name>
differs further from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. australianus
</tp:taxon-name>
and other New Caledonian species by the presence of a setiferous tubercle instead of a spine between ventral spine 1 and the proximal margin of the femur.

Supplementary description
</p>
      <p>CARAPACE. Median eyes and median ocular tubercle well developed; pair of setae on median ocular tubercle; lateral eyes well developed, seta posterior to lateral ocular triad; lateral ocular triad well separated from margin of carapace.</p>
      <p>STERNUM. Tritosternum projected anteriorly with typical setation; other sternal platelets wide, with seta on each lateral border and some smaller setae in between; pentasternum with two setae anteriorly and without seta in membranous region.</p>
      <p>OPISTHOSOMA. Ventral sacs and ventral sac cover absent.</p>
      <p>GENITALIA. Posterior margin of female genital operculum slightly convex; gonopod cushion-like and slightly sclerotized basally. Male gonopod with margin of fistula and lateral lobes sclerotized; lateral lobe 2 fimbriate.</p>
      <p>CHELICERAE. Small, flat tooth on retrolateral surface of basal segment, opposite to bifid tooth; retrolateral surface of claw with row of setae from ventral to dorsal; claw with four teeth; row of eight or nine setae on prolateral surface of basal segment; bifid tooth on basal segment with dorsal cusp larger than ventral cusp.</p>
      <p>PEDIPALPS. Coxal dorsal carina without seta encircled by round carina and with four setae on margin. Femur with five dorsal spines and four ventral spines; setiferous tubercle between ventral spine 1 and proximal margin. Patella with three dorsal spines and three prominent setiferous tubercles proximal to spine III; prominent setiferous tubercle distal to spine I, one-third length of spine I; two ventral spines and small setiferous tubercle closer to spine II; three setiferous tubercles between spine I and distal margin. Tibia with ventral spine distally and two setae between spine and distal margin. Tarsus with two dorsal spines, distal spine long, about one-third length of tarsus, proximal spine one-third length of distal spine; several long setae ventral to distal spine; cleaning organ with 29 setae in ventral row.</p>
      <p>
LEGS. Tibia of leg I with 23 articles; tarsus I with 41 articles; first tarsal article similar in length to sum of subsequent five articles, and second article very short (mean length of first article:

; mean sum of lengths of subsequent five articles: 
1.05 mm
, n =2). Leg IV basitibia with four pseudo-articles, trichobothrium 
bt

bc
situated slightly closer to 
sbf
than to 
bf
, 
sc
and 
sf
series each with five trichobothria.
