      <p> Natural history </p>
      <p> The localities at which <tp:taxon-name> C. potiguar </tp:taxon-name> has been recorded are
         situated in a karstic limestone formation, known as the Apodi group, dated to the late
         Cretaceous. The area is situated in the Caatinga biome, the only semi-arid biome in Brazil
         , with low rainfall most of the year. <tp:taxon-name> Charinus potiguar </tp:taxon-name> is
         widespread within the formation, but its abundance in each cave is usually low (3.9 ± 3.4
         individuals). Vasconcelos et al . (2013) suggested that caves might not be the primary
         habitat of the species, noting that more individuals were found in the caves during the dry
         season. For example, in 16 caves sampled during the dry and wet seasons, the abundance was
         significantly higher in the dry season than in the rainy season ( t -value: -2.91, p =
         0.007), which, according to Vasconcelos et al . (2013) suggests that specimens are
         migrating into the caves when the outside climate is unfavourable. L.S. Carvalho (pers.
         com.) noted that specimens can be found under rocks at the entrance of the caves. Specimens
         are usually found on the cave walls, although immatures were frequently found under rocks
         on the floor. A schizomid, <tp:taxon-name> Rowlandius potiguar Santos, Ferreira &amp;
            Buzatto, 2013 </tp:taxon-name> , and several pholcid spiders, <tp:taxon-name> Metagonia
            potiguar Ferreira, Souza, Machado &amp; Brescovit, 2011 </tp:taxon-name> and
            <tp:taxon-name> Micropholcus sp. </tp:taxon-name> inhabit the same caves (L.S. Carvalho,
         pers. com.). Potential prey species observed in the cave included crickets (
            <tp:taxon-name> Endecous sp. </tp:taxon-name> ) and cockroaches. </p>
