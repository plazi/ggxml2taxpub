The 
lectotype
specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chassalia blumeana
</tp:taxon-name>
[L 0057738] was collected in 
Java
. The infructescence of the 
lectotype
specimen is a 3-branched compound cyme with branches and rachis 
2–4 mm
long. The branches and rachis remain short during fruit maturation. The exact distribution of this species in Borneo
</p>
      <p>
is unknown. The specimen most similar to the 
lectotype
found in 
Borneo
from the 
Kew
herbarium is:

         <tp:taxon-name>
Chassalia blumeana

differs from other species by the base of the inflorescence peduncle not having bracts, and by having the branches and rachis of the infructescence less than 
5 mm
long. It differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chassalia ramosa
T.Y.Yu
</tp:taxon-name>

by having just 1 flowering branch, rather than two or more per stem.
</p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Chassalia blumeana
</tp:taxon-name>
may be the taxonomically most difficult species among all Asian species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chassalia
</tp:taxon-name>
. Most of the specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chassalia
</tp:taxon-name>
from Borneo were previously identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cephaelis psychotrioides
</tp:taxon-name>
(= 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chassalia psychotriformis
</tp:taxon-name>
) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cephaelis stipulacea
</tp:taxon-name>
(synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chassalia blumeana
</tp:taxon-name>
). These specimens contain a wide range of morphological variation. The 
lectotype
specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chassalia blumeana
</tp:taxon-name>
from Java shows that this species seems to have 1 peduncle and 3 capitula on highly reduced partial peduncles less than 
0.5 cm
long. This makes the inflorescence look as though it is one big capitulum. The description in the protologue indicates that this species is distributed from West to Central Java (
Blume 1826
–1827). Additional information is provided by the description and illustration of 
Valeton (1913a)
. These highlight the short partial peduncles (
5–10 mm
long) which are slightly longer then the partial peduncle of the 
lectotype
specimen. 
Valeton (1913a)
recorded it as distributed from Java and in Borneo from northwest Indonesian Borneo to southwest Malaysian Borneo (Kuching). In this survey, specimens which appear to be a reasonable match for the type specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. blumeana
</tp:taxon-name>
have been found in both Indonesian Borneo and Malaysian Borneo (Kuching), as well as 
Brunei
. However, several specimens from west 
Sarawak
to 
Sabah
seem to share similarity with the typical 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. blumeana
</tp:taxon-name>
but also vary somewhat from this species. Therefore, the delimitation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. blumeana
</tp:taxon-name>
with similar specimens from Borneo still needs further study.
