This was reported by 
Horstmann (1985)
as a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. tibialis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Following 
Horstmann (1985)
, specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
corsicator
</tp:taxon-name>
in Aubert’s collection belong to neither 
<tp:taxon-name>
tibialis
</tp:taxon-name>
nor related species, as they have an ovipositor ratio of about 1.6 (whilst 
<tp:taxon-name>
tibialis
</tp:taxon-name>
in Horstmann’s collection has an index of about 1.3). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Campoplex corsicator
</tp:taxon-name>
also has very short temples (temple in lateral view about 0.5–0.6 as long as the transverse diameter of the eye in 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. tibialis
</tp:taxon-name>
) and the area basalis triangular, i.e., with lateral carinae bounding the area basalis converging posteriorly to a single point, then extended to a short longitudinal carina towards the base of the area superomedia (area basalis trapezoidal, i.e., with lateral carinae converging posteriorly, but not touching at the base of the area superomedia in 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. tibialis
</tp:taxon-name>
) (see redescription below and 
Fig. 3
).
