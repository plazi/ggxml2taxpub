Description
</p>
      <p>
CARAPACE. Ten anterior setae (
Fig. 35A
); frontal process triangular, visible in dorsal view (
Fig. 35C
). Small granules densely scattered between ocular triads and among sulci. Median eyes reduced, median ocular tubercle absent (
Fig. 35C
); pair of setae near remnants of median eyes; lateral eyes weakly developed, pale, seta posterior to each lateral ocular triad (
Fig. 35A
).
</p>
      <p>
STERNUM. Tritosternum projected anteriorly, with typical setation (
Fig. 35B
); other sternal platelets broad, flat, with pair of setae on each side and some smaller setae posteriorly; pentasternum with six setae anteriorly and without seta near membranous region (
Fig. 35B
).
</p>
      <p>OPISTHOSOMA. Ventral sacs and ventral sac cover absent.</p>
      <p>GENITALIA. Female genital operculum with prominent setae posteromedially and smaller setae near margin; posterior margin of gonopod with pair of shallow lateral sulci; gonopod cushion-like, with retrolateral margins of fold projecting over other margin; base of gonopods unsclerotized. Male unknown.</p>
      <p>CHELICERAE. Small tooth, slightly projecting from retrolateral surface of basal segment, opposite to bifid tooth; retrolateral surface of claw with two patches of setae, one basal, other medial; claw with five teeth; transverse row of around five setae on prolateral surface of basal segment; bifid tooth on basal segment with cusps subequal in size.</p>
      <p>
PEDIPALPS. Coxal dorsal carina with two prominent setae encircled by round carina and two setae on margin. Femur with three dorsal and three ventral spines (
Fig. 35E–F
); two prominent setiferous tubercles between dorsal spine 1 and proximal margin; setiferous tubercle between ventral spine 1 and proximal margin. Patella with three dorsal spines in primary series (
Fig. 35E
); prominent setiferous tubercle distal to spine I, one-third length of spine I; patella with two ventral spines in primary series; setiferous tubercle between spine I and distal margin. Tibia with ventral spine distally and two setae between spine and distal margin. Tarsus with two dorsal spines, proximal spine one-third length of distal spine (
Fig. 35D
); cleaning organ with 31 setae in ventral row.
</p>
      <p>
LEGS. Tibia of leg I with 23 articles; tarsus I with 41 articles; first tarsal article slightly longer than second article. Leg IV basitibia with three pseudo-articles, without sclerotized, denticulate margin at apex of articles; trichobothrium 
bt

sbf
and 
bf
