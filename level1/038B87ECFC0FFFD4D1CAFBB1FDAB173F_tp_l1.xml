Description
(female)
</p>
      <p>
BODY LENGTH
. 
1.2–1.3 mm
.
</p>
      <p>
COLOR
. Black; antennae, mandibles, tegulae and legs including coxae medium brown; base and apex of fore tibiae, base of mid and hind tibiae, and segments 1–4 of all tarsi light brown.
</p>
      <p>
HEAD
. From above 2.1 times as wide as long, 1.2 times as wide as mesosoma; occiput rounded, finely reticulate-coriaceous, medially with weak transverse elements, anteromedially with a few weak transverse carinae not wider than ocellar area; vertex finely reticulate-coriaceous (not transversely so); frons smoothly fan-like reticulate out from a weak longitudinal midline. Eyes bare. OOL:POL:LOL = 3.5:6.5:3.0. Head in frontal view one and a third times as wide as high. Malar space slightly more than half as long as eye height (5.0:9.5). Antenna with A1 shorter than height of head (15:16), longer than distance between inner orbits (15:14). Length:width of A1–A10 = 15.0:2.5; 4.0:1.9; 2.0:1.2; 2.5:1.7; 2.8:1.5; 3.5:1.9; 3.5:1.8; 3.4:2.0; 3.4:2.0; 4.5:1.9. Flagellar pubescence short.

. Habitus in lateral view.

</p>
      <p>MESOSOMA. 1.45 times as long as wide, higher than wide (19:18). Sides of pronotum weakly reticulate, in lower half longitudinally so, smoother along narrow upper and hind margins. Mesoscutum with a few setae, most of them anterolaterally and along hind margin, weakly reticulate, smoother medially on lateral lobes and posterior 0.25; notauli distinct in about posterior half, then fade out, meeting in a fine point just touching base of scutellum; scuto-scutellar grooves narrowly triangular, each covered by about seven setae. Mesopleuron smooth. Scutellum evenly convex, smooth, anterolaterally slightly leathery, medially bare, towards margins dense setose. Metapleuron with pilosity all over, though not dense. Propodeal carinae short, parallel; area between them distinctly wider than long, smooth.</p>

WINGS
. Fore wing 0.85 as long as entire body, 2.7 times as long as wide, surpassing tip of metasoma by a distance equal to 1.25 times combined length of 
T
3– 
T
6, clear, with fine and dense microtrichia; marginal cilia 0.08 width of wing. Hind wing 5.6 times as long as wide, with two hamuli; marginal cilia 0.3 width of wing.

      <p>
METASOMA. As long as rest of body to very slightly longer (37:35), about 1.9 times as long as wide, 1.1 times as wide as mesosoma. Length:width of 
T
1– 
T
6 = 5.0:9.0; 20.0:19.7; 3.0:19.0; 3.5:17.0; 3.5:13.5; 4.0:8.5. 
T
1 with about ten rather uniform, fine longitudinal carinae, with a transverse depression around midlength. 
T
2 striate to half of its length, medially slightly shorter, rest of 
T
2 as well as following tergites smooth, 
T
6 with faint traces of reticulation. Apical tergites with setae in fine punctures: about four on 
T
3, ten on each of 
T
4 and 
T
6, and 12 on 
T
5.
