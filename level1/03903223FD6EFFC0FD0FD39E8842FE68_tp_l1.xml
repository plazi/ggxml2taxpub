Description
</p>
      <p>
SHELL (
Figs 4
A–B, 5A). Short turriform, about 1.7 times as high as than wide, white-translucent with light brown periostracum; protoconch with fine pits comprising 0.75 whorls (
Fig. 6A
); entire shell with 3.875 to 4.25 whorls without structure apart from growth lines; umbilicus narrow; aperture orthocline, almost circular, only slightly higher than wide.
</p>
      <p>
OPERCULUM (
Fig. 7
). Yellowish to light orange, paucispiral; with non-calcareous white peg in submarginal nucleus.
</p>
      <p>EXTERNAL FEATURES. Epidermis without pigment; eyes small with bean-shaped pigment spot; tentacles without particular ciliation.</p>
      <p>MANTLE CAVITY. No ctenidial filaments; osphradium ovate-elongate.</p>
      <p>
DIGESTIVE SYSTEM. Radula has formula R 5-6 1 5-6/2 2, L 4-5 1 7, M1 25-29, M2 22-24 (
Fig. 8A
); stomach without caecum; intestine makes narrow, long coil in roof of mantle cavity.
</p>
      <p>
FEMALE GENITALIA (n = 3; 
Fig 9A
). Ovary short, simple sac not reaching stomach; renal oviduct first coiling 180° clockwise, then 270° counter-clockwise; one small, distal receptaculum seminis; bursa copulatrix globular, behind albumen gland, bursal duct entering ventrally; ovoviviparous, brooding at least one embryo in pallial oviduct, pallial oviduct as brood pouch with albumen gland as well as capsule gland with a larger posterior and short anterior section.
</p>
      <p>
MALE GENITALIA (n = 1; 
Fig. 9B
). Testis sac with short lobes, starting more than one whorl below apex, comprises ca 0.5 whorl, anteriorly just reaching stomach; vesicula seminalis coils along anterior half of testis; proximal and distal vasa deferentia insert closely in about middle of flat pear-shaped prostate; penis slender, unclear from CT-scans whether it has a lobe or not.

is most similar to

in terms of shell size and shape (
Fig. 3
). The latter is the only other species of the genus for which sequence data exist. The divergence of the species was fairly large (
Fig. 2
) with a COI p-distance of 0.07, and 45 and 14 diagnostic characters in COI and 16S, respectively (
Table 2
). The reduced eyes suggest that this species dwells in the transition zone of epigean and ground waters. The new species occurred sympatrically with
