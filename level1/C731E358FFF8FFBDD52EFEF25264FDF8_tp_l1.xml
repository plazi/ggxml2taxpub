Comparative diagnosis

This species belongs to the 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. apidanus
</tp:taxon-name>
species-group (formerly a monotypic group from the Aru Islands) according to the position of its recurrent vein (m-cu) of the fore wing, arising from the parallel vein (CU1a) at a long distance from the apex of the brachial (subdiscal) cell, and the entirely smooth metasomal tergites behind the petiole. This new species distinctly differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. apidanus
Nixon, 1943
</tp:taxon-name>
by several diagnostic characters: vertex smooth (striate in

<tp:taxon-name>

Etymology

      <p>
Named from the combination of the Latin words ‘ 
australis
’ (= south) and ‘
