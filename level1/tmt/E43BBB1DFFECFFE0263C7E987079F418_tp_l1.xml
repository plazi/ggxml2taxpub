Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>

43 mm
in length, fusiform, with weakly concave, nearly smooth subsutural ramp and nodules on shoulder of upper teleoconch whorls, absent on later whorls of large specimens. Spiral sculpture weak, of closely spaced cords covering entire shell except subsutural ramp in some specimens. Radula with central tooth and longitudinally folded marginal teeth with weakly thickened edges.

SHELL (
holotype
). Moderately thick, glossy, strong except for very fragile and partially broken outer aperture lip, narrowly fusiform, with high spire and long, narrow, straight siphonal canal. Protoconch small, globose, corroded, of about 1.5 whorls. Protoconch preserved in other juvenile specimen (MNHN-IM-2013-48156), comprising just over 1.5 strongly convex, microshagreened whorls. Protoconch/teleoconch transition indistinct, marked by appearance of axial ribs. Protoconch diameter 1.0 mm, height 
0.74 mm
. Spire whorls angled at shoulder, last whorl with less angular shoulder. Total teleoconch whorls just under 8. Suture shallowly impressed on last whorl and rather deep on spire whorls, subsutural ramp moderately broad, weakly concave on upper teleoconch whorls and nearly flat on penultimate and last whorls. Subsutural ramp with distinct prosocline axial wrinkles, extending from suture to upper ⅔ of ramp, 22–23 on first and second whorls, 24 on penultimate and 31 on last whorl, and without spiral sculpture on upper four whorls and later with indistinct spiral cords, three on last whorl. Shoulder of teleoconch whorls (except last one) with a row of distinct, opisthoclinely elongated nodules, intersected by weak spiral cords. Seventeen nodules on first teleoconch whorl, 18 on antepenultimate and penultimate whorls. Weak spiral cords on and below shoulder, starting from 3 
rd
teleoconch whorls, about twice as wide below shoulder. Penultimate whorl with four cords on shoulder and four below shoulder. Shoulder smooth on last whorl, but with about 55 cords below shoulder, of which 25 on canal. Cords weak, slightly wavy and closely spaced, their intervals about half the width of cords. Shell base gradually narrowing towards long, narrow, nearly straight siphonal canal. Aperture narrow, constricted posteriorly, with narrow, very thin parietal callus, outer lip badly broken, distinctly impressed at shoulder, weakly convex below shoulder and shallowly concave at transition to canal. Anal sinus judging from growth lines shallow, subsutural, broadly arcuate, confluent with forward extension of outer lip. Shell very light yellowish, protoconch very light tan (in 
holotype
) and light brown in MNHN-IM-2013-48156.
</p>
      <p>ANATOMY (n = 1; MNHN-IM-2009-29311). Male. Penis tip obliquely truncated, with long and very narrow papilla, surrounded by circular fold, much larger in diameter than papilla itself. Proboscis conical, moderately long, with broad base, anterior half rapidly narrowing towards tip. Proboscis retractors distinct, arranged in two symmetrical lateral bundles, attached to inner proboscis walls at border of its posterior third. Buccal mass with small radular sac, odontophore situated within proboscis in its broader posterior part; elongate oval, occupying slightly less than half of proboscis length. Single small accessory salivary gland present. Salivary glands separate, acinous, irregular in shape. Venom gland long, moderately thick and convoluted, opening into oesophagus within the nerve ring.</p>
      <p>
RADULA (n = 1; MNHN-IM-2009-29311) (
Fig. 8D
). Short, comprising 28 rows of teeth, 13 nascent. Radula length 
1.15 mm
(7.9% of AL without canal), width up to 255 μm (1.8% of AL without canal), tooth length 160 μm (1.10% of AL without canal). Central tooth with subrectangular basal plate, having distinct borders and long, narrow, sharp cusp. Anterior margin overlapped by preceding row, posterior margin formed by two straight sections meeting at obtuse angle in midline. Marginal teeth flat when formed, becoming trough-shaped with weakly thickened edges during maturation, folded longitudinally when fully formed, with both margins overlapping at tooth tip. Resulting folded tooth moderately broad, with sharp pointed tip, anterior edge with a narrow slit between tooth margins. Tooth folding occurring within 15 
th
row of teeth.

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
The largest specimen attains 
43.1 mm
.
</p>
      <p>
Other specimens are similar to the 
holotype
in shell shape, although some have much more pronounced spiral sculpture, especially MNHN-IM-2009-29230, which also retains spiral cords on the shoulder of the last whorl.
</p>
      <p>
In shell shape and sculpture the new species is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sibogasyrinx filosa
</tp:taxon-name>
, some specimens being almost indistinguishable (e.g., 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. filosa
</tp:taxon-name>
and MNHN-IM-2009-29230). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sibogasyrinx lolae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
can be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. filosa
</tp:taxon-name>
due to its generally less distinct spiral sculpture and less concave, nearly flat subsutural ramp. Other conchologically similar species are 
<tp:taxon-name>
S.
cf. 
pyramidalis
</tp:taxon-name>
1 and 2, but these differ in their radular morphology. In both these species and 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. lolae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
, the nodules on the shoulder become less pronounced or disappear on later whorls. Nevertheless, the nodules are still pronounced on the shoulder of the last whorl in specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S.
cf. 
pyramidalis
</tp:taxon-name>
1 and 2 of the same size as specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. lolae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
which already lack nodules on the last whorl.
