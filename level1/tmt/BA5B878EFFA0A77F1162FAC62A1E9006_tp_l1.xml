Etymology
</p>
      <p>
The species is named after the Andasibe-Mantadia National Park located about 
150 km
east of 
Antananarivo
, consisting principally of primary growth forest of the Alaotra-Mangoro Region in eastern 
Madagascar
. The park’s two component parts are Mantadia National Park and Analamazoatra Reserve (
Newsome &amp; Hassell 2014
).
