in the fore tarsomere 4 black and simple, segment 2 half as long as segment 3. The fore tarsus has segment 4 yellow, flattened and widened in the new species, with posterior comb of 8–9 long flattened setae, segment 2 as long as segment 3. The fore basitarsus is 2–3 times as long as the fore tibia, and the last segment of the fore tarsus is white in both species.

Etymology
</p>
      <p>
The species is named after the former 
Fianarantsoa Province
in the southeastern part of 
Madagascar
, where the Ranomafana National Park is situated (
65 km
southwest of 
Fianarantsoa
city), now in the regions of Haute Matsiatra and Vatovavy-Fitovinany. With more than 41 600 hectares of tropical rainforest, the Park is home to many rare species of flora and fauna. It is part of the World Heritage Site Rainforests of the Atsinanana.
