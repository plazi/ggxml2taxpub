Comparative diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
This new subspecies is very similar to the trans-tropical 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hemidoryctes carbonarius carbonarius
(Ashmead, 1894)
</tp:taxon-name>
, but differs from it by the distinctly postfurcal position of the fore wing recurrent vein
</p>
      <p>
(m-cu) (always antefurcal in 

H. c. 
<tp:taxon-name>carbonarius</tp:taxon-name>

) and recorded only in 
Yemen
(with wide pantropical distribution for 

H. c.

Second radiomedial (submarginal) cell long, 3.5–3.8 times longer than its maximum width, 1.4 times longer than the narrow brachial (subdiscal) cell. First medial abscissa (1-SR+M) distinctly sinuate. Recurrent vein (m-cu) distinctly postfurcal, 4.5–5.0 times longer than second abscissa of medial vein (2-SR+M), 0.6 times longer than first radiomedial vein (rm). Nervulus (cu-a) strongly postfurcal, distance from nervulus (cu-a) to basal vein (1-M) 1.6–2.0 times nervulus (cu-a) length. Brachial (subdiscal) cell open apically, but present short brachial vein (CU1b). Parallel vein (CU1a) weakly curved basally. Hind wing 5.0–5.2 times longer than wide. First abscissa of costal vein (C+SC+R)about as long as second abscissa. Medial (basal) cell rather narrow, weakly widened posteriorly, 11.0–13.0 times longer than wide, 0.4 times as long as hind wing.

Third tergite finely to very finely and densely semi-circularly transversely aciculate in anterior half, reticulate coriaceous in latero-posteriorly, almost smooth on wide medial half. Remaining tergites mainly smooth, but densely and finely or very finely granulate laterally. Vertex mainly with sparse, short and semi-erect white setae directed forward.
