Workers monomorphic with little size variation (
types
: HL 0.48–0.52, HW 0.45–0.48; non-types HL 0.46–0.48, HW 0.41–0.44). Head in full-face view subrectangular, longer than wide, posterior margin with a shallow median concavity (
Fig. 5a
). In profile, clypeus broadly and weakly convex (
Fig. 5c
); dorsum of head finely striate (
Fig. 5a
); striations on posterior half of head generally weaker and more fragmented; ventral face of head largely superficially reticulate. In dorsal view, mesosoma subrectangular with almost parallel sides and weakly concave posterior propodeal margin (
Fig. 5b
); posterolateral corners of propodeum bluntly angulate, slightly projecting posteriorly and distinctly, though shallowly, differentiated from inner posterior propodeal face. Propodeal junction in lateral view roundly obtuse (
Fig. 5d
); posterior propodeal declivitous face weakly marginate and shallowly concave (
Fig. 5b, d
); propodeal dorsum differentiated from posterior face by weakly marginate edge.Anterior face of petiole weakly concave (
Fig. 5d
), with fairly dense appressed and decumbent hairs. Head, mesosoma dorsum and gaster darker brown than rest of body; dorsum of head sometimes with blackish undertones.

queen (non-types: HL 0.48–0.49, HW 0.44–0.45), head in full-face view subrectangular and slightly narrower anteriorly (
Fig. 6a
). Anterior clypeal face in profile weakly and broadly convex, sometimes almost flat (
Fig. 6d
). Posterior half and ventral face of head largely smooth and shiny, with feeble striations on frons and vertex. Dorsal outline of mesosoma weakly and broadly convex; propodeal junction roundly obtuse and indistinct (
Fig. 6d
). In dorsal view, anterior margin of pronotal disc broadly convex with roundly obtuse humeral corners; mesoscutum slightly wider than long; propodeum much wider than long; propodeal dorsum weakly convex and rounding into steep posterior declivity at indistinct rounded posterior edge; posterior propodeal face with shallow median concavity (
Fig. 6c
). Dorsum of mesosoma largely finely striate and shiny; lateral-most triangular area of mesoscutum immediately above parascutellar carina mostly smooth and shining (
Fig. 6c
); apicodorsal faces of petiole and postpetiole feebly and superficially reticulate(
Fig. 6b, d
), each with a central area that is smooth and shining (
Fig. 6b
). Body largely uniformly dark brown; head, dorsum of mesosoma and gaster slightly darker brown, tibia and tarsus yellowish brown.

Male
</p>
      <p>
Small size (non-types: HL 0.39–0.41, HW 0.38–0.4). Head in full-face view sub-spherical, posterior margin broadly and strongly rounded (

: fig. 21); in lateral view, head with dorsum gently inclined posteriorly; clypeus in profile with distinct dorsal and anterior faces separated by a roundly angulate edge, dorsal face gently sloped downwards and nearly flat, anterior face steep and very weakly convex or flat (
Fig. 7a
). Median ocellus subcircular, less elongate and slightly smaller than lateral ocelli; frontal lobes distinctly raised and differentiated from frontal supraclypeal area; posterior apex of supraclypeal area bluntly rounded (

Wang 
et al.
2018b

: fig. 21). In posterior view, posterior propodeal face indistinctly marginate, weakly differentiated from lateral propodeal face by indistinct rounded lateral margin. In lateral view, petiole short and subtrapezoidal, longer than high, anterior margin long, steep and weakly concave, apical dorsum weakly convex, rounding into short posterior face at indistinct rounded edge (

Workers monomorphic with little intranidal variation in size. Head in full-face view subrectangular, longer than wide, posterior margin with a broad but shallow median concavity, posterolateral corners roundly convex, lateral margins of head broadly convex and weakly converging anteriorly, anterior clypeal margin less wide than posterior margin of head, with broadly and weakly convex median section (
Fig. 5a
). Eye with 11–16 ommatidia for 
types
and specimens for 
Singapore
, 13–21 ommatidia for Thai specimens. In lateral view, outline of clypeus evenly and weakly convex, projecting slightly forward from dorsal margin of head (
Fig. 5c
). Mesosoma in lateral view box-shaped or subcylindrical, dorsal outline weakly and broadly convex, propodeal junction roundly obtuse, propodeal declivity steep and shallowly concave (
Fig. 5d
); dorsum of propodeum differentiated from posterior declivitous face by a weak but distinct marginate edge. In dorsal view, mesosoma subrectangular with lateral sides almost parallel to each other; anterior margin of pronotal disc broadly convex, sometimes angulate at its median point, humeral corners rounded and often indistinctly angulate; lateral margins of propodeum broadly convex, transitioning to and differentiated from weakly concave posterior propodeal margin at bluntly angulate posterolateral corners (
Fig. 5b
); posterolateral corners slightly projecting posteriorly and differentiated from inner posterior propodeal face. Posterior face of propodeum weakly marginate, rounding into lateral propodeal face at indistinct angulate edge. In lateral view, petiole inclined posteriorly, slightly longer than high, distinctly narrower at apex than at base, anterior face weakly concave and longer than posterior face; apex roundly convex, apical dorsum rounding smoothly into steeper posterior face at indistinct rounded edge; petiole higher and longer than postpetiole, dorsal margin of postpetiole weakly convex and nearly flat (
Fig. 5d
). In dorsal view, petiole suboval, wider than long; postpetiole globular and less than twice as wide as petiole (
Fig. 5b
).
</p>

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
Thai populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. javana
</tp:taxon-name>
appear to be generally larger in size compared to populations from 
Indonesia
(
Java
) and 
Singapore
(Java and 
Singapore
TL 1.83–2.02; 
Thailand
TL 2.02–2.88). In terms of variation in morphological measurement metrics, Thai populations also seem much more variable relative to the other two countries (e.g., Thai HL 0.46–0.58; Java HL 0.48–0.52; 
Singapore
HL 0.46– 0.48), however, this might have arisen from bias in geographic range of sampling. For Thai 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. javana
</tp:taxon-name>
, measurements were taken from 13 individuals from seven colonies distributed across Central, North and West 
Thailand
, whereas for Java and 
Singapore
, mostly individuals from 1–2 colonies were measured. A combination of measurements from different countries may be a more accurate representation of actual variation within the species.
</p>
      <p>
Thai colonies that could be morphologically identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. javana
</tp:taxon-name>
were extremely variable in terms of COI (313 bp), with internidal divergences spread across multiple different values from 0.0–4.5% (
Fig. 1
). While sequence divergence between different species existing in sympatry can be as low as 3.8% (average uncorrected 
p
distance) in ants, especially for recently diverged species (

Wang 
et al.
2018a

), higher percentage distances (&gt; 4%) between allopatric populations do not necessarily indicate different species. In the latter case, clustering based on barcodes may split allopatric or geographically distant populations of the same species, belonging to older lineages that diverged genetically back in time (

Meier 
et al.
2008

). Thus, in light of the two aforementioned possibilities, inferring species boundaries from the clustering pattern of Thai 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. javana
</tp:taxon-name>
specimens is complicated. If we define allopatric colonies as those coming from different parts (i.e., North, South, East, West, Central) of 
Thailand
, then possibly the split clusters observed (
Fig. 1
) mostly represent different lineages of the same species 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. javana
</tp:taxon-name>
. However, 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. javana
</tp:taxon-name>
colonies considered ‘sympatric’ from North and Central 
Thailand
respectively diverged at 4.5% (
Fig. 1
), suggesting (but not ascertaining) possible newly diverged species. Taking into account the broad inter- and intranidal variation shown amongst 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. javana
</tp:taxon-name>
workers, we were unable to observe any striking morphological differences between specimens from the genetically divergent clusters. Given the lack of more convincing morphological or molecular evidence supporting further species delimitation in this study, we tentatively treat these colonies as conspecific. The possibility remains for this current treatment to be revised in future, when gene flow between 
<tp:taxon-name>
R. javana
</tp:taxon-name>
populations are more thoroughly investigated, and the relevant data from other molecular markers are made available.
