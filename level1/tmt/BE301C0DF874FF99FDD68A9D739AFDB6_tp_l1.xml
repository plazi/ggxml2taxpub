Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
Recognized by the yellow or orange-yellow ground color with contrasting dark pattern, specifically distinguished by the uniformly black antennal segments I and II, dark brown tibiae, presence of black longitudinal stripes at sides of anterior part of pronotum, and the two more stripes close to midline on posterior part and the almost entirely black hemelytron with the apex of clavus, the basal half of cuneus, and the base and extreme apex of endocorium yellow (

Description
</p>
      <p>
Male
</p>
      <p>
COLORATION. Yellow to orange yellow, with contrasting black pattern (
Fig. 2E
). Head: yellow to orangeyellow, with postocular region of vertex black and sometimes with a narrow brown mark on frons along midline; eye silvery with black band along inner margin in frontal view; antennal segments I and II black, remaining segments brown; labium brown. Thorax: pronotal collar and calli with longitudinal black stripes laterally, disc of pronotum with two black stripes close to midline and darkened posterior angles; thoracic venter pale brown, propleura with similar black longitudinal stripe; exposed part of mesoscutum and scutellum yellow to orange-yellow, with lateral black patches at base. Hemelytron: clavus black, with V-shaped yellow region apically; corium yellow to orange yellow, with entirely black exocorium and with three large, almost confluent, longitudinal black patches separated by branches of R+M vein and occupying most of endocorium except base and extreme apex; cuneus yellow to orange yellow with black apical half. Legs: coxae pale brown to pale yellow; femora yellow with darkened apices and a diffuse dark brown ring on apical third; tibiae brown to dark brown, pale yellow medially. Abdomen: yellow to orange yellow, with lateral black patches.
</p>
      <p>SURFACE AND VESTITURE. Dorsum finely punctate; head, pronotum and hemelytra weakly rugose, with yellow, long, erect simple setae, antenna and legs with setae somewhat longer than elsewhere.</p>
      <p>
STRUCTURE. Body elongate-oval, total length 2.5× as long as basal width of pronotum. Head: transverse, with distinctly convex and anteriorly projecting frons; eye sessile, large, occupying half of head height in lateral view, not in contact with anterior margin of pronotum due to well-developed postocular region of vertex; vertex slightly convex; antennal fossa, prominent, round, narrowly separated from eye, located near ventral eye margin; antennal segment I short, subequal to vertex width, tubular and narrowing at base; segment II 1.2× as long as head width, about half as thin as segment I, slightly dilate apically; segments III and IV short, filiform, subequal in length; labium long, reaching abdominal sternite III. Thorax: pronotum 1.6× as wide as long, with collar concave, distinctly wider than diameter of antennal segment I, slightly narrowing towards midline, posteriorly well delimited by an impressed line; calli raised, anteriorly and posteriorly delimited by impressed lines; disc of pronotum slightly raised, trapeziform, with strongly sinuate posterior margin; mesoscutum largely exposed; scutellum slightly longer than exposed part of mesocutum, slightly raised; metathoracic scent gland efferent system reduced, with narrow opening and peritreme (
Fig. 25B
). Hemelytron: costal margin slightly concave, hemelytron broadest at level with apex of clavus; slightly above cuneus, cuneus about 1.5× as long as wide, with distinct cuneal fracture; primary cell of membrane large, far exceeding apex of cuneus, secondary cell narrow.
</p>
      <p>
GENITALIA. Genital capsule short and wide, with a large, posteriorly directed aperture (
Figs 17
, 
18A– B
); dorsal margin with very large, spoon-shaped lobe more than twice as long as genital capsule and equipped with groove running towards apex; lateral margins of genital capsule with large, slightly asymmetrical lobes resembling parameres; aedeagus and parameres strongly reduced, parameres almost equal in length, located close to each other on ventral margin of capsule; left paramere as in 
Fig. 18C–D
, right paramere as in 
Fig. 18E
. aedeagus with entirely membranous phallotheca, simple membranous endosoma, and ductus seminis with membranous basal part and sclerotized, spine-like apical part (
Fig. 18F
).
</p>
      <p>
Female
</p>
      <p>Similar to male but slightly smaller. Coloration as in male but vertex with a longitudinal pale brown marking and eye entirely silver, without any black markings.</p>

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
The new species is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. pallescens

Poppius, 
1912
</tp:taxon-name>
in size, body proportions, vestiture, and general color-pattern but it differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. dandeliensis
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
in the pale-brown ground color, the diffuse, weakly expressed dark markings on the dorsum, and the coloration of antennal segment II and tibiae. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lopidolon sordidus
</tp:taxon-name>
is similar to the new species in the contrasting black and orange coloration but differs from it in the largely darkened head, uniformly dark brown antennal segments I–II, reddishbrown tibiae, presence of a pair of uninterrupted black stripes on pronotum running from collar to posterior margin of disc, and longer vestiture.
