Radial vein (r) arising behind middle of pterostigma, from basal 0.6. Radial (marginal) cell not shortened, metacarpus (1-R1) 1.3–1.4 times longer than pterostigma. Second radial abscissa (3-SR) 2.3–3.3 times longer than first abscissa (r) and forming with it obtuse angle, 0.50–0.65 times as long as the weakly curved third abscissa (SR1), 1.0–1.3 times as long as weakly curved or straight first radiomedial vein (2-SR). Second radiomedial (submarginal) cell weakly narrowed distally, its length 3.1–3.6 times maximum width, 1.0–1.1 times length of brachial (subdiscal) cell. Second abscissa of medial vein (2-SR+M) short, 0.8–1.5 times as long as recurrent vein (m-cu). Nervulus (cu-a) strongly antefurcal, distance between basal vein and nervulus 1.8–2.5 times nervulus length. Mediocubital vein (M+CU1) submedially strongly sinuate and deep curved to longitudinal anal vein (1-1A). Narrow brachial (subdiscal) cell closed apically before recurrent vein. Parallel vein (CU1a) interstitial. Hind wing 5.5–6.0 times longer than its maximum width. First costal abscissa (C+SC+R) 0.7–1.0 times as long as second abscissa (1-SC+R).
