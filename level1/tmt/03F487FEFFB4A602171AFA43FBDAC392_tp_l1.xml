Fig. 9A
). For body size see above ‘Material examined’. Cephalothorax comprises 28–34% of body length, pleon (without telson) 54–67%, and carapace (without rostrum) 20–31%. Abdominal somites 1–5 measure 0.7–1.0, 0.6–1.0, 0.7–0.9, 0.7– 0.9, and 0.6–1.0 times the length of somite 6, respectively.
</p>
      <p>
CARAPACE (
Fig. 9B
). Carapace covers 70–81% of cephalothorax dorsally. Rostrum reaches at most to distal ⅔ of artificially straight forward-oriented eyestalks (without cornea). Cervical sulcus short but strong. Cervical pore group consists of 11–15 pores with about 
1 µm
diameter in a roughly U-shaped arrangement. Posterior margin leaving 1–2 posterior thoracic somites mid-dorsally exposed.
</p>
      <p>
EYES (
Fig. 9
A–C). Eyestalks and cornea dorsoventrally compressed (
Fig. 9A
). Eyestalks without scales. In dorsal view (
Fig. 9
B–C) the cornea appears calotte-shaped, measuring 0.8–1.0 times length of eyestalk (cornea not included). In lateral view (
Fig. 9A
) the cornea appears ovoid with flattened ventral margin, length 1.5 times maximum width.
</p>
      <p>

Fig. 10
A–D). Trunk extends 40–58% its length beyond eyes, 19–40% beyond antennal scale. Measured without apophysis along dorsal midline, basal segment is 32–47% trunk length, median

Terminal segment 1.2–1.5 times as long as wide. Mid-dorsal apophysis with 4–5 barbed setae. Outer antennular flagellum thicker than inner one by a factor of 1.3–1.5 when measured near basis of flagella. Male lobe setose, inserts ventrally close to terminal margin of antennular trunk, length is 18–26% width of terminal segment of trunk, its width 15–28%.

      <p>
GNATHOPODS (thoracic endopods 3; 
Fig. 10
I–M). Ischium 1.2‾2.2 times as long as wide; merus 2.0‾3.6 as long as wide and 1.5‾2.2 length of ischium. Carpus 0.5–0.8 times length of merus, 0.9–1.1 times ischium. Claw 2.6–3.9 times dactylus length, and 45–50% carpopropodus. Both sexes with series of basally thickened, unilaterally barbed setae (

</p>
      <p>MARSUPIUM. Oostegites 1–2 (derivates of thoracopods 7–8) without setae on upper (dorsal) margins. Lower margins from subbasal region up to the rounded tip bearing series of setae, most of which barbed by fine cilia along subbasal to median portions. Oostegite 1 near basis with 6–9 setae, oostegite 2 with 5–7 setae which are sparsely microserrated along distal half. Ventral and rostral portions of outer face of only second oostegite with total of 9–11 whip setae, but shorter than barbed setae. Thoracopod 6 with rudimentary oostegite represented by small, rounded lobe terminally with four setae which are microserrated on their distal half.</p>

TAIL FAN (
Figs 9
E–F, 10N). Scutellum paracaudale triangular, tip acute or narrowly rounded (
Fig. 10N

70–110 µm
, thickness 
40–45 µm
(n = 4). Statoliths discoidal with shallow fundus and distinct tegmen. Statolith formula 2 + (2–3) + (1–2) + (5–9) + (4–5) = 15–20. Telson length 1.3–1.4 times its maximum width or 0.9–1.0 times length of endopod of uropod, 0.8–0.9 times exopod of uropod, and 1.1–1.4 times last abdominal somite, respectively.
