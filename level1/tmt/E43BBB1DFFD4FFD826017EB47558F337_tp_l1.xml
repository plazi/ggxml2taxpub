Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
Shell small, reaching 
29 mm
in length, pagodiform, with strongly concave subsutural ramp bearing two low spiral cords and distinct subsutural nodules. Axial sculpture of distinct opisthocline ribs extending to shell base, 10–11 per whorl. Spiral sculpture of closely spaced cords on and below shoulder. Radula lacking central tooth, marginal teeth trough-shaped with thickened edges.

SHELL (
holotype
). Moderately thick, except for fragile, partially chipped outer aperture lip; pagodiform, with moderately high spire and moderately long, narrow siphonal canal inclined to abaxially left. Protoconch missing (rendering exact an whorl count and protoconch measurements impossible), upper teleoconch whorls eroded. Teleoconch whorls rapidly increasing and strongly angled at shoulder, more than 8 remaining. Suture shallowly impressed, subsutural ramp broad, concave. A row of distinct, sharp, subsutural nodules on upper teleoconch whorls. Nodules less distinct on last three whorls and situated on short, slightly raised, prosocline axial ribs. Number of ribs on uppermost whorls indeterminate due to shell surface erosion, number of nodules per whorl increasing from 16–17 on first intact whorl to 22 on penultimate and 26 on last whorl. Subsutural ramp smooth except for nodules and two low, indistinct subsutural cords. Shoulder with pronounced, thickened, opisthocline axial ribs on all teleoconch whorls. Axial ribs on upper teleoconch whorls situated just above suture, extending to shell base on last whorl, number of ribs constant, 11–12 per whorl. Ribs intersected by closely spaced, rounded spiral cords, number increasing from 5 on uppermost remaining whorl to 10 on penultimate whorl. Last whorl with total of 38 cords, including 18 on canal. Cords narrow, their intervals 0.5–1.5 times cord width. Shell base rapidly narrowing towards narrow, moderately long siphonal canal. Aperture narrow, constricted posteriorly, with thin, moderately broad parietal callus, outer lip partially broken, convex on subsutural ramp, with rounded angle at shoulder, convex below shoulder and weakly concave at transition to canal. Anal sinus judging from growth lines shallow, subsutural, broadly arcuate. Shell flesh-coloured, with darker base, glossy. Periostracum thin, persisting in some cord intervals.

      <p>ANATOMY (n = 1; MNHN-IM-2009-11327). Female. Proboscis relatively short, straight, cylindrical. Proboscis retractors large, in two bundles attached at proboscis base. Buccal mass within proboscis, rather long, about half length of proboscis, radular sac opening on right. Venom gland very thick, not long, opening with very short constriction just posterior to nerve ring. Venom bulb moderately large, elongate.</p>

RADULA (n = 2; MNHN-IM-2009-16825, AL 
9.9 mm
, IM-2009-11327, AL ca 
9 mm
). Relatively short, comprising 20–24 rows of teeth, 8–9 nascent. Radula length 
1.1–1.6 mm
(12–16% of AL without canal), tooth length 150 μm (1.7% of AL without canal). Central tooth absent. Marginal teeth trough-shaped when mature (
Fig. 8F
), with slightly thickened edges and sharp pointed tips. Teeth initially forming as a flat, elongate-oval plate, its edges gradually thickening along radular membrane and then by longitudinal folding of each tooth on 10–11 
th
row, counting from rear.

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
The second live collected specimen has a broken shell base. In sculpture pattern it is very similar to the 
holotype
.
</p>
      <p>
The species is distinct from all congeners in having a relatively broad, pagodiform shell with a shorter canal. Conchologically the species is quite similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Comitas paupera
(Watson, 1881)
</tp:taxon-name>
, a highly variable species of uncertain generic affinity, but differing in lacking distinct spiral cords on the subsutural ramp. The 
lectotype
and 
paralectotypes
of the latter were illustrated by 
Sysoev (1996
: figs 42–48). Superficially, the new species also strongly resembles a miniature copy of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Leucosyrinx luzonica
(
Powell, 1969
)
</tp:taxon-name>
(see 

Kantor 
et al.
2018

: fig. 21), but differs in the shape of the marginal radular teeth and foregut anatomy. Another species of

Leucosyrinx
</tp:taxon-name>
from the 
Solomon Islands
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Leucosyrinx
sp. D
</tp:taxon-name>
, is similar to the new species in shell outline (
Fig. 13F
), differing in radular morphology.
