Occipital carina not fused with hypostomal carina below being obliterated for short distance upper base of mandible. Vertex convex.</p>
      <p>ANTENNA. Antenna filiform, more than 23-segmented (apical segments missing). Length of scape 1.6 times its maximum width. First flagellar segment about 4.0 times longer than its apical width, 0.9 times as long as second segment. Subapical segment 3.5 times longer than wide.</p>
      <p>MESOSOMA. Length 2.2 times its height. Pronotum anteriorly straight (dorsal view), posteriorly strongly and narrowly convex dorsally (lateral view). Pronotal carina distinct, widely separated from posterior margin of pronotum, distances from carina to anterior and posterior margins of pronotum subequal. Mesoscutum weakly and gently-roundly elevated above pronotum. Notauli rather deep, complete and crenulated. Mesoscutum without median longitudinal depression. Prescutellar depression rather short, rather deep, its posterior sides straight obliquely directed posterolaterally, with distinct median carina, sparsely and finely sculptured, 0.3 times as long as convex scutellum. Precoxal sulcus distinct, crenulatereticulate, straight, long, running along entire lower part of mesopleuron. Prepectal carina rather strong, not widened below, without lobes opposite fore coxae. Metanotum with short, slender and pointed tooth directed posteriorly. Metapleural lobe rather short, wide, rounded distally.</p>
      <p>WINGS. Length of fore wing 4.0 times its maximum width. Radial (marginal) cell not shortened. Metacarpus (1-R1) 1.15 times longer than pterostigma. Radial vein (r) arising weakly before middle of pterostigma. First radial abscissa (r) forming very obtuse angle with second abscissa (3-SR). Second radial abscissa (3-SR) 1.9 times longer than first abscissa (r), 0.5 times as long as third abscissa (SR1), 1.6 times longer than first radiomedial vein (2-SR). Second radiomedial (submarginal) cell not widened distally, its length about 3.0 times maximum width, 1.1 times longer than brachial (subdiscal) cell. First medial abscissa (1-SR+M) weakly sinuate.

Vertex and frons distinctly and densely granulate-coriaceous, without striation or rugosity; temple finely reticulate-coriaceous in upper half, almost smooth in lower half. Face densely and finely reticulate-coriaceous, smooth in lower lateral parts. Mesoscutum densely granulate, without striation along notauli, with two subparally and almost straight striae in medio-posterior third. Scutellum granulate-coriaceous. Mesopleuron entirely densely reticulate-coriaceous, finely sculptured below precoxal sulcus. Propodeum with areas delineated by distinct carinae, with median carina in anterior half, areola rather short, pentagonal, rugose-granulate; long basolateral areas densely reticulatecoriaceous, without striation along carinae. Legs finely coriaceous in upper halves and almost smooth in lower halves. First tergite with distinct dorsal carinae in anterior half. First to fifth tergites distinctly, densely and at least partly undulately striate, with fine and dense rugulosity between striae. Second-fifth tergites laterally with distinct striae and very fine rugosity between it. Vertex with short and sparse semierect white setae directed backwards. Mesoscutum almost entirely with rather dense and semi-erect white setae, its lateral lobes glabrous on narrow lateral parts. Metasoma dorsally almost entirely with short and rather dense semi-erect white setae directed backwards. Hind tibia dorsally with almost erect and rather dense white setae, length of these setae 0.7–0.8 times maximum width of hind tibia.</p>
