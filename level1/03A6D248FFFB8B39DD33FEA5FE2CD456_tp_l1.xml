is named for Deepak Apte, a great naturalist and the Executive Director of the 
Bombay
Natural History Society, 
Mumbai
, 
India
. Deepak Apte provided great help in the organization of our fieldwork in 
India
as well as with molecular lab work at the National Centre for Cell Science in Pune. We would not have been able to explore the mangroves of 
India
without his assistance.

Description
</p>
      <p>
Color and morphology of live animals
(
Fig. 59
) Live animals are not usually covered with mud, and their natural color is usually visible without washing. The dorsal notum is brown, sometimes with darker markings. The notum bears low, elongated (longitudinal) ridges. The foot is black (
Malaysia
) or dark brown (
India
). The background of the hyponotum is bright yellow (
Malaysia
) to light yellow or beige (
India
) with a varying number of spots that range from light brown (
India
) to dark brown or black (
Malaysia
). Spots tend to be more concentrated around the margin of the hyponotum, but their density is highly variable (from only around the margin to the entire hyponotum). Exceptionally, the hyponotum can be homogenously dark brown with only a small yellow band around the foot. Small or juvenile specimens tend to have fewer or no spots on the hyponotum. Papillae with dorsal eyes are present. Their exact number is variable (between 35 and 50). Each papilla bears one dorsal eye. The dorsal eyes are distributed across the notum, with numerous eyes at the margin of the notum (i.e., many eyes are &lt;
2 mm
from the notum edge).

Reproductive system
(
Figs 61C
,

)
</p>
      <p>
In the posterior part of the reproductive system, the oviduct is wider than the deferent duct (up to twice as wide). Its distal section (distal to the spermatheca) is slightly longer than its proximal section and is sharply bent (U-shaped). The deferent duct is slightly longer than the oviduct, not attached to it, and loosely to highly convoluted (
Fig. 61C
). The penial sheath is very thick but the penis inside is extremely thin. The vestibule is cylindrical and attached to the anterior, dorsal wall of the visceral cavity by many short muscle fibers. The distal, flexible region of the penis with hooks is approximately 
2.5 to 5 mm
long and is very narrow, approximately 
80 µm
wide. Penial hooks are large, approximately 
30 to 40 µm
long, and can be seen inside the semi-transparent penis. The retractor muscle of the penis inserts at the posterior end of the visceral cavity, near the rectum. The retractor muscle varies from much shorter than the penial sheath (one-fifth its length) to approximately as long as the penial sheath. In the penial complex, the deferent duct is convoluted in small loops (
Fig. 62D
).
