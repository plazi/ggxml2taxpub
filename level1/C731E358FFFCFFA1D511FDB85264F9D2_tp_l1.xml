Nixon’s (1943)
key, this new species belongs to the 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. dissors
Wilkinson
</tp:taxon-name>
species-group being similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. zagreus

</tp:taxon-name>

Philippines
. However, 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. lahji
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
distinctly differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. zagreus
</tp:taxon-name>
by having all maxillary palpal segments entirely dark reddish brown (apical segment whitish in 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. zagreus
</tp:taxon-name>
), fore and middle tibiae entirely black (pale at apex in 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. zagreus
</tp:taxon-name>
), vertex entirely and very densely granulate reticulate (with distinct traces of transverse aciculation in 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. zagreus
</tp:taxon-name>
), temple very densely punctate-reticulate (virtually smooth in 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. zagreus
</tp:taxon-name>
), mesonotum with low but distinct longitudinal keel (without keel and flat in 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
), mesopleuron entirely finely reticulate-coriaceous (with broad smooth shining area in 
<tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>
