Here, we add new distributional data and new illustrations. Yigong Township is now the current northernmost distribution of 
<tp:taxon-name>

. (

himalayensis
</tp:taxon-name>
. The species was considered by Brunetti to be variable but within certain limits and can be easily recognized by the pale yellow wide ring on all the femora about as far from the tip as the width of the ring. We examined other additional material, in addition to the previously indicated: 
1 ♂
(
paratype
) Darjiling; 
6000 feet
a.s.l.; 
22 Sep. 1908
; Brunetti (USNM) / 
1 ♂
(
syntype
) Darjiling; 
20 Oct. 1905
; Brunetti (BMNH(E)#246064). There is no difference in the characteristics of the femora of the three, but the wing veins are slightly different. It seems that the difference in the wing veins shown in Joseph’s illustrations (
Joseph 1974
) can be regarded as intraspecific variation. But there are also some differences in the shape of inner gonostylus as shown in the illustrations, especially the beak different from others. It is necessary to make further observations on the specimens of ZSI.
