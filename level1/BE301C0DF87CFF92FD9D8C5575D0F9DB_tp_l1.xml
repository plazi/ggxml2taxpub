Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
Recognized by the following characters: total body length 3.2–3.7; corium uniformly yellow, without dark pattern (
Fig. 3D
); antenna uniformly dark brown, usually with reddish tinge; right lateral wall of genital capsule deeply excavated, with large, apically rounded sclerotized outgrowth (
Fig. 21A–B
); right paramere flattened, with broadly semicircular dorsal expansion (
Fig. 21C–D
); base of aedeagus with large, characteristic, uniformly sclerotized outgrowth; apex of aedeagus with small, entirely membranous lobe (
Fig 21F
).

Description
</p>
      <p>
Male
</p>
      <p>
COLORATION. Dorsum pale lemon yellow to pale brown (
Fig. 3D–E
); head pale yellow, antennal segments dark brown to reddish brown; pronotum yellow, sometimes with pale brown anterior angles; pro-, meso- and metathorax laterally brown, ventrally pale brown or yellow; scutellum pale brown to dark brown; hemelytron uniformly lemon yellow, with narrowly brown or black costal margin and claval commissure; legs uniformly yellow; abdomen yellow ventrally, pale brown at sides.
</p>
      <p>STRUCTURE. Total length 3.2–3.5; body 3.5–3.7× as long as basal width of pronotum; head transverse, vertex 1.8–2.0× as wide as dorsal width of one eye, 0.8–0.9× as wide as length of antennal segment I; segment II 0.8–0.9× as long as head width, 0.6× as long as basal width of pronotum; pronotum 1.8–1.9× as wide as long.</p>
      <p>
GENITALIA. Genital capsule (
Fig. 21A–B
) subquadrate, short and broad, about 1.5× as wide as long, with large aperture; right lateral wall of capsule deeply excavated, with prominent, apically rounded process. Left paramere (
Fig. 21E
) scythe-shaped, with slightly and uniformly swollen body and gradually tapering, apically upturned apical process. Right paramere (
Fig. 21C–D
) somewhat larger than left one, broad, lamellate, with strongly expanded, semicircular body. Aedeagus (
Fig. 21F
) tubular, C-shaped, very thin and evenly sclerotized, with small, entirely membranous apical lobe; Dorsal wall of aedeagus at base with large, hook-shaped sclerotized outgrowth, apically flattened and serrated.

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
The new species is easily distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. sirsiensis
</tp:taxon-name>
gen. et sp. nov.
by its more uniform dorsal coloration and striking features of the male genitalia. A peculiar sclerotized outgrowth originating from the extreme base of the aedeagus seems to be a unique feature within eccritotarsines.
