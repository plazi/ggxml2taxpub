            <p> LEGS. First metatarsomere longer than fifth (S1/S5 = 1.8) ( Fig. 2A ). </p>
            <p>ELYTRON. Longer than wide (EL/EW = 1.8), at sides about 1.6× as long as elytron along

                  angle ( Fig. 1C ). Sternum VIII slightly emarginate apically at middle, with
                  numerous long setae on apical area and small setae on basal area ( Fig. 1D ).
                  Sternum IX symmetrical, narrowed in the middle of its lateral margins, deeply
                  emarginate apically, with several fine and short setae at each side of
                  emargination ( Fig. 1E ). Tergum X with apex rounded, with numerous setae at apex
                  ( Fig. 1F ). Aedeagus with median lobe distinctly broadened at middle and
                  gradually narrowed towards a rather truncate apex seen from above, paramere
                  triangular with base concave ( Fig. 1 G–H), internal sclerites as in Fig. 1 G–H. </p>

            <p> Geographical distribution and bionomics </p>
            <p> The male holotype of <tp:taxon-name> O. serpentinus </tp:taxon-name> was collected
                  in 1873 by Jelski in “Peruvia centralis” ( Fig. 1B ). Jelski travelled and
                  collected in the central Andes of Peru during that year ( Solsky 1875 ;
                  Taczanowski 1875 ; Mlíkovský 2009 ) and the localities he visited are summarized
                  in the Supp. file 1 and Figs 4–5 . Based on these analyses, the type locality
                  “Peruvia centralis” is located in the department of Junín , but we do not have
                  more information (e.g., day and/or month of collection) to improve the accuracy of
                  this type locality ( Fig. 1B ). Additionally, the new locality provided by the
                  female specimen from Hacienda Llaguén, ca 7°40′ S , 78°40′ W , 1800 m [m a.s.l.] (
                  Koepcke 1982 ) is located in the department of La Libertad and close to the Forest
                  of Llaguén ( 7°42′ S , 78°44′ W , 2642 m [m a.s.l.]), which is described as a dry
                  cloud forest, with high human disturbance and used for grazing cattle and as a
                  source of fuel ( Valencia 1990 ). Hacienda Llaguén is placed in the ecoregion of
                  Peruvian Yungas ( Olson et al . 2001 ) or in the Puna province ( Morrone 2014 ) (
                  Fig. 4 ) and nowadays it is placed in the ecosystem of Andean shrublands ( MINAM
                  2019 ). According to label information, the female specimen was collected in an
                  open area within a montane forest and riverside shrubbery. </p>
