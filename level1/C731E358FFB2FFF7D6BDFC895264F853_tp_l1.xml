Etymology
</p>
      <p>
The name of this species refers to the Latin words ‘ 
albus
’ (white) and ‘ 
setosis
’ (pubescence), after the white body setosity of this species.

Metacarpus (1-R1) 1.15–1.20 times longer than pterostigma, almost 7.0 times longer than distance from apex of radial (marginal) cell to apex of wing. Radial vein (r) arising weakly before middle of pterostigma, from basal 0.45. First radial abscissa (r) forming distinct obtuse angle with second abscissa (3-SR). Second radial abscissa (3-SR) 2.6–2.7 times longer than first abscissa (r), 0.5 times as long as third abscissa (SR1), 1.5 times longer than first radiomedial vein (2-SR). Second radiomedial (submarginal) cell not widened distally, its length 3.0–3.3 times maximum width, 0.85–1.00 times length of the wide brachial (subdiscal) cell. First medial abscissa (1-SR+M) distinctly sinuate. Recurrent vein (m-cu) weakly postfurcal. Mediocubital vein (M+CU1) rather distinctly curved to anal vein (1-1A) in distal half. Distance from nervulus (cu-a) to basal vein (1-M) 0.6–0.7 times nervulus (cu- a) length. Brachial (subdiscal) cell rather gently and almost roundly closed almost on level of recurrent vein (m-cu); posterior bulla on brachial vein (CU1b) present; posterior abscissa of anal vein (2-1A) (behind brachial vein (CU1b)) shortly present. Hind wing not narrowed basally, 5.4–5.5 times longer than wide. First costal abscissa (C+SC+R) 0.5–0.6 times as long as second abscissa (1-SC+R). First abscissa of mediocubital vein (M+CU) 0.50–0.55 times as long as second abscissa (1-M). Recurrent vein (m-cu) long and unsclerotised.</p>

Second to fifth tergites distinctly and densely striate, with distinct and dense rugulosity or striation between striae; sixth tergite striate with very dense reticulation in anterior two–thirds, striae more or less concentrically in posterior third. Second-fifth tergites laterally with rather distinct striae and very dense rugosity-reticulation between it. Vertex with long and rather dense semi-erect white setae mainly directed backwards. Mesoscutum with dense semi-erect white setae widely arranged along notauli and anteriorly and in usually single line laterally. Mesopleuron almost entirely with sparse long and white setae. Metasoma dorsally almost entirely with long and rather dense semi-erect white setae directed backwards. Hind tibia dorsally with almost erect or semi-erect, rather dense white setae; length of these setae 1.0–1.3 times maximum width of hind tibia.</p>
