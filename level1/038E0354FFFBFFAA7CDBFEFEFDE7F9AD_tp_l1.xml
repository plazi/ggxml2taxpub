         <tp:taxon-name>
Drepanoistodus
cf.

is included in the present work because it superficially resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
Drepanoistodus viirae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
Originally, 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. suberectus
</tp:taxon-name>
was described as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oistodus suberectus
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Upper Ordovician strata of 
Missouri
, 
USA
, by 
Branson &amp; Mehl (1933)
, but it was not until 1966 that conodont specialists included the geniculate element in the apparatus (see 
Bergström &amp; Sweet 1966
and 
Webers 1966
, for details). The 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. suberectus
</tp:taxon-name>
type
locality near Ozora, 
Missouri
, was located and restudied by 
Bergström &amp; Leslie (2010)
who documented the conodont fauna and illustrated three different elements of 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. suberectus
</tp:taxon-name>
, including the geniculate element. The Upper Ordovician geniculate 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. suberectus
</tp:taxon-name>
elements (e.g., 
Stauffer 1935
; 
Nowlan 2002
; 
Bergström &amp; Leslie 2010
) are generally more rounded anteriorly and carry more pronounced keels on the cusp than the three geniculate elements at hand, thus leading us to leave the Lynna River specimens in open nomenclature.

      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Drepanoistodus
cf. 
suberectus
</tp:taxon-name>
occurs only sporadically in the Lynna River section samples. It is characterised by a short upper margin of the base compared to the free cusp (b/c ratio near 
0.20 in
the 
three specimens
found). Angle A between the upper margin of the cusp and the carina on the cusp (see 
Fig. 3
) varies considerably (41–52°) but it is wider than that of the other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Drepanoistodus
species
</tp:taxon-name>
described here. Moreover, it is typified by a convex basal margin; weakly rounded anterior margin, and a weakly developed carina on the straight cusp, which is located on the lower half part of the cusp.

Superficially, 
<tp:taxon-name>
D
. cf. 
suberectus
</tp:taxon-name>
resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. viirae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
because of the relatively short base, but the latter species is distinguished by a narrower angle A (see 
Fig. 3
); wider sides anteriorly on the cusp; laterally compressed cusp with distinct keels, and a median, as opposed to a lower, carina.
