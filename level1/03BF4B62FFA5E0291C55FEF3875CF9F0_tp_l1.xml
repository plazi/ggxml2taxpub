Description

      <p>
BODY LENGTH. Male (
holotype
): length 
26.3 mm
, width of thoracic shield 
16.1 mm
, of tergite 7 
16.7 mm
(widest), height of thoracic shield 
8.9 mm
, of tergite 7 
9.3 mm
(highest).
</p>
      <p>
COLORATION. Head, collum, thoracic shield and tergites light brown with dark posterior margins. Anal shield entirely light brown (
Fig. 2E
). Antennae dark green, legs basally light brown, apically green.
</p>
      <p>HEAD. Eyes with more than 65 ommatidia. Antennae short, protruding back to leg 5. Length of antennomeres 1=2 =3=4 =5&lt;6. A shallow groove present on antennomere 1, disc with 48/49 apical cones.</p>
      <p>GNATHOCHILARIUM AND MANDIBLE. Not dissected.</p>
      <p>
STIGMATIC PLATES. First stigmatic plate triangular, apex sharply edged, pointed, turned towards coxa. Hairs most abundant on apical margin (
Fig. 9C
).
</p>
      <p>PLEURITES. First pleurite extending posteriorly in a well-rounded process. Second pleurite also with a well-rounded process, but not projecting. Remaining pleurites broadly rounded.</p>
      <p>COLLUM. Margins with a few short hairs, central part glabrous.</p>
      <p>THORACIC SHIELD. Surface like those of tergites, glabrous.</p>
      <p>
TERGITES. Smooth and glabrous, no small pits present. Paratergites projecting slightly posteriorly. ENDOTERGUM. Inner section with numerous short spines and isolated bristles. Between marginal ridge and inner area a single row of sparse, circular cuticular impressions. Externally two dense rows of marginal bristles. Bristles scaly, the longest reaching above tergite margin (
Fig. 5E
).
</p>
      <p>ANAL SHIELD. Rounded, neither bell-shaped nor tapered, glabrous. Ventral side with two black locking carinae, located closely to laterotergites. Anterior carina small and posterior carina 2–3 times as long as anterior carina.</p>
      <p>
LEGS. Leg 1 with 4 ventral spines, leg 2 with 5 or 6, leg 3 with 7. First two leg pairs without an apical spine, spine present on leg 3. Leg pairs 4–21 with 9 or 10 ventral spines and an apical spine. On leg 9, femur 2.1 and tarsus 5.1 times as long as wide. All podomeres with setae (
Fig. 9A
).
</p>
      <p>
Male sexual characters
</p>
      <p>
GONOPORE. Covered with a single undivided, apically rounded, membranous, basally sclerotized plate covering ¼ of surface of coxa. Gonopore located basally on joint (
Fig. 9B
).
</p>
      <p>
ANTERIOR TELOPODS. Harp with single stridulation rib located mesally, long and well developed (
Fig. 9D
). First podomere 1.1 times as wide as long. Second podomere process lobe-like and slightly curved with rounded edges, protruding up to half of third podomere height, apically with sclerotized spots (
Fig. 9F
). Third podomere long, almost as long as first; cavity mesally with numerous sclerotized spots and three thin, sclerotized spines located apically (
Fig. 9E–F
); one sclerotized spot located close to tip, laterally with a row of ca 11 crenulated teeth (
Fig. 9E
). Podomeres 1–3 covered on both sides with numerous long, isolated hairs.
</p>
      <p>
POSTERIOR TELOPODS. Movable finger slender and long, with a well-rounded tip, not tapering towards tip; hollowed-out inner margin with 3 or 4 sclerotized spines located apically, posterior aspect with ca 25 small sclerotized teeth (
Fig. 9G
). Movable finger 4 times as long as wide, slightly longer than fixed finger. Fixed finger straight, only apically curved towards movable finger, not tapering, more slender than third podomere. Fixed finger at margin with numerous sclerotized spots (
Fig. 9H
). First podomere in posterior view almost glabrous, podomeres 2 and 3 covered on both sides with numerous long, isolated hairs.
