Description
</p>
      <p>
BODY. Shape elongated. Length 
0.4 cm
. Smooth dorsal surface. Background pigmentation orange-garnet (
Fig. 5E
). Cerebral and tentacular eyes, scattered between the small tentacles (
Fig. 5F
). Ruffled pharynx, well developed, extending along 
⅔
of the body. Male and female genital pores located in the posterior half of the body, together, but clearly separated.
</p>
      <p>
MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. Male copulatory system backwards oriented, with a small penis papilla. Prostatic vesicle surrounded by muscular layers and lined with fingered granular lining, most probably polyglandular (
Fig. 5
G–H). Seminal vesicle divided into two sections. A muscular and elongated proximal section, and a more rounded distal section provided with a thin wall. Both regions separated by muscle narrowing (
Fig. 5H
). The distal section leads to the seminal duct that opens into the prostatic duct and forms a short ejaculatory duct. The two 
vasa deferentia
dilated to form spermatic vesicles, open into the proximal section. Male atrium small, englobing a short penis papilla (
Fig. 4H
).
</p>
      <p>FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. Apparatus simple and backwards oriented. Comprises an elongated tube without clear differentiation between external and internal vagina and ends in a small widening, without Lang’s vesicle.</p>

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
The new species belongs to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Distylochus
</tp:taxon-name>
due to the presence of few scattered marginal, tentacular and cerebral eyes. Gonopores together and are located near the posterior end. Male apparatus with a short papilla and unarmed. Seminal vesicle configured in two regions, following the “doublevesicle-system” after 
Faubel (1983)
and female apparatus simple, without Lang’s vesicle.
</p>
      <p>
There are currently only three known species for the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Distylochus
</tp:taxon-name>
: 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. pusillus
(Bock, 1913)
</tp:taxon-name>
recorded for 
Hong Kong
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. martae
(Marcus, 1947)
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Brazil
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. isifer
(Du Bois-Reymond, 1955)
</tp:taxon-name>
also from 
Brazil
. These species were described on fixed specimens, therefore the colors are unknown, but apparently and after the original descriptions, they have pale pigmentation that contrast sharply with the orange-vermilion colors of the new species.
</p>
      <p>
The most conspicuous difference of the new species is the disposition of female and male gonopore. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
Distylochus fundae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
the gonopores are clearly separated, while in the Brazilian species are common and in the Chinese species are very close together.
