14.2 mm
(widest), height of thoracic shield 
7.2 mm
(highest).
</p>
      <p>
COLORATION. Head, collum, thoracic shield and tergites dark brown to black. Grooves of thoracic shield greenish, anal shield lighter brown (
Fig. 2F
). Antennae and legs green.
</p>
      <p>HEAD. Eyes with more than 50 ommatidia. Antennae short, protruding back to leg 4. Length of antennomeres 1&gt;2&gt;3=4 =5&lt;6. A shallow groove present on antennomere 1, disc with 33/12 apical cones.</p>
      <p>GNATHOCHILARIUM AND MANDIBLE. Not dissected.</p>
      <p>
STIGMATIC PLATES. First stigmatic plate triangular, apex well-rounded, slender, curved towards coxa. Hair most abundant on apical margin (
Fig. 11C
).
</p>
      <p>PLEURITES. First pleurite extending slightly posteriorly in a long, thin process.</p>
      <p>COLLUM. Margins covered with a few short hairs, central part glabrous.</p>
      <p>THORACIC SHIELD. Surface like those of tergites, glabrous.</p>
      <p>TERGITES. Smooth and glabrous, no small pits. Paratergites projecting slightly posteriorly.</p>
      <p>
ENDOTERGUM. Inner section with numerous short spines and isolated bristles. Between marginal ridge and inner area a single row of sparse large, circular cuticular impressions, distance between impressions larger than their diameter. Marginal brim wavy towards inner area. Externally 1 or 2 rows of marginal bristles. Bristles scaly, of medium length, longest reaching slightly above tergite margin (
Fig. 10A
).
</p>
      <p>ANAL SHIELD. Rounded, neither bell-shaped nor tapered, covered with numerous short setae. Ventral side of anal shield with two black locking carinae, located close to laterotergites. Anterior carina small and posterior carina 3 times as long as anterior carina.</p>
      <p>
LEGS. Leg 1 with 1 ventral spine, leg 2 with 2–4, leg 3 with 3 or 4. First two leg pairs without an apical spine, spine present on leg 3. Leg pairs 4–21 with 7 or 8 ventral spines and an apical spine. On leg 9, femur 2.4 and tarsus 4.2 times as long as wide. All podomeres with setae (
Fig. 11A

      <p>
Male sexual characters
</p>
      <p>
GONOPORE. Covered with a single undivided, rounded, apically membranous, basally sclerotized plate, covering ¼ of surface of coxa. Gonopore located basally on joint (
Fig. 11B
).
</p>
      <p>
ANTERIOR TELOPODS. Harp with two stridulation ribs, mesal rib smaller than lateral one, both ribs well developed, located in mesal corner (
Fig. 11D
). First podomere 1.1 times as wide as long. Second podomere process lobe-like and slightly curved, with rounded edges, protruding up to half of third podomere height, apically with sclerotized spots. Third podomere long, as long as first; cavity mesally with numerous sclerotized spots and three thin, sclerotized spines; one sclerotized spot located close to tip; laterally with up to 12 crenulated teeth. Podomeres 1–3 covered on both sides with numerous long, isolated hairs.
</p>
      <p>
POSTERIOR TELOPODS. Movable finger with a well-rounded tip, tapering towards tip; hollowed-out inner margin without lobes but with 5 sclerotized spines, 2 located apically, 2 at midpoint and 1 basally (
Fig. 11H
). Posterior aspect of movable finger with ca 14 small sclerotized teeth (
Fig. 11G
). Movable finger slightly longer than fixed finger, the latter slender (4 times as long as wide), apically curved towards former. Fixed finger basally with a single spine, at margin with numerous sclerotized spots. First podomeres almost glabrous, movable and immovable finger covered on both sides with numerous long, isolated hairs, only tips of chela glabrous.

Distribution and ecology
</p>
      <p>
This species is currently known only from the vast lowland rainforests of the Masoala Peninsula on the east coast (
Fig. 3
).

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
Despite several attempts, no DNA could be extracted from the male 
holotype
. Therefore, its degree of similarity to the two much larger females known and sequenced from the Masoala area (
KY399024
and 
KY399025
) could not be assessed (see 
Fig. 1
).
