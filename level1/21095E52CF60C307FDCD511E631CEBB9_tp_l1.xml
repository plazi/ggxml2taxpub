Preliminary remarks
</p>
      <p>
The classification of ornate 
<tp:taxon-name>Bairdiidae</tp:taxon-name>
is complex and still disputed mainly because of the difficulty to unravel the taxonomic significance of their lateral ornamentation features. As detailed in 
Forel &amp; Grădinaru (2020)
, the revision of their classification requires the addition of new characters to avoid producing another classification system that would only be a new point of view further complicating the current situation. The peak of diversity of ornate 
<tp:taxon-name>Bairdiidae</tp:taxon-name>
occurred in the Late Triassic but they were already present in the Permian (see 
Forel &amp; Crasquin 2020
and references therein for a review) as illustrated for instance by the material described herein from the Middle Permian of the 
Guadalupe
Mountains. Specifically, the confusion and instability of the conceptions of 
Petasobairdia
Chen, 1982 and 
Praelobobairdia
Kozur, 1991
have recently been described and discussed in 
Forel &amp; Grădinaru (2020)
. Herein, we follow the view that 
Praelobobairdia
is a junior synonym of 
Petasobairdia
, as was first introduced by 
Becker (2001)
.
