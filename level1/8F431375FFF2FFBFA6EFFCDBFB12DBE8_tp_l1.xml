Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
This species may be separated from other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Charinus
</tp:taxon-name>
in eastern South America by means of the following combination of characters: anterior margin of carapace with corners weakly developed into small roundish knobs; median ocular tubercle indistinct; lateral eyes present, but reduced, with flattened lenses; female gonopods small, slightly longer than wide, sucker-like, with rounded opening; cheliceral claw with nine or twelve teeth; pedipalp femur with three dorsal spines and three ventral spines; pedipalp patella with four dorsal spines and three ventral spines; pedipalp tarsus with two long spines similar in length; tibia of leg I with 23 articles, tarsus I with 40 or 41 articles; leg IV basitibia with four pseudo-articles.

Supplementary description
</p>
      <p>CARAPACE.Ten anterior setae; frontal process triangular, not visible in dorsal view. Small granules densely scattered between ocular triads and among sulci. Median eyes reduced, median ocular tubercle absent; seta near remnants of median eyes; lateral eyes reduced, pale, seta posterior to lateral ocular triad.</p>
      <p>STERNUM. Tritosternum projected anteriorly, with typical setation; other sternal platelets narrow, concave, with pair of setae anteriorly and some smaller setae posteriorly; pentasternum with twelve setae anteriorly and three setae near membranous region.</p>
      <p>OPISTHOSOMA. Ventral sacs and ventral sac cover absent.</p>
      <p>GENITALIA. Female genital operculum with prominent setae posteromedially and some smaller setae near margin; posterior margin of genital operculum with pair of shallow lateral sulci; gonopod sucker-like, with short stem and wide opening of genital atrium; gonopods unsclerotized basally. Male gonopod with base of fistula and lateral lobe sclerotized; lateral lobe 2 fimbriate.</p>
      <p>CHELICERAE. Small tooth projecting slightly from retrolateral surface of basal segment, opposite to bifid tooth; retrolateral surface of claw with two patches of setae, one situated basally, the other medially; claw with 9–12 teeth; transverse row of around ten setae on prolateral surface of basal segment; bifid tooth on basal segment with dorsal cusp larger than ventral cusp.</p>
      <p>PEDIPALPS. Coxal dorsal carina with three prominent setae encircled by round carina and three setae on margin. Femur with three dorsal spines and four ventral spines; small spine between dorsal spines 2 and 3; two prominent setiferous tubercles between dorsal spine 1 and proximal margin; long spine between ventral spine 1 and proximal margin; small spine between spines 1 and 2 and 2 and 3. Patella with three dorsal spines in primary series; prominent setiferous tubercle distal to spine I, one-third length of spine I; three ventral spines in primary series; long spine between spine I and distal margin. Tibia with ventral spine distally and five setae between spine and distal margin. Tarsus with two dorsal spines, proximal spine half length of distal spine; cleaning organ with 29–30 setae in ventral row.</p>
      <p>
LEGS. Tibia of leg I with 23 articles; tarsus I with 41 articles; first tarsal article shorter than subsequent articles. Leg IV basitibia with four pseudo-articles, without sclerotized, denticulate border at apex of articles; trichobothrium 
bt
situated in proximal third of pseudo-article; distitibia trichobothrium 
bc
situated closer to 
sbf

Natural history
</p>
      <p>
All specimens were collected in the dark zone of the cave; none were found in the dry, upper galleries, where the phrynichid, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Trichodamon princeps
Mello-Leitão, 1935
</tp:taxon-name>
, was abundant. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Charinus eleonorae
</tp:taxon-name>
may be found inside small galleries or holes in the cave walls. Females carry up to 
15 eggs
and five embryos (
Baptista &amp; Giupponi 2003
). The cave is experiencing intense human disturbance including the installation of a water pump and construction of a water dam (L.S. Carvalho, pers. com.).
