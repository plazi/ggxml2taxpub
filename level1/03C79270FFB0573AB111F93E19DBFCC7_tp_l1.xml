      <p>
Higgins (1986)
mentions that he accessed the 
type
material of 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. pilosus
in SMNH
</tp:taxon-name>
, mounted and observed two paratypic specimens. However, such mounted specimens were found in neither the SMNH nor the USNM.
</p>
      <p>
After examining the 
syntypes
and providing the present redescription we choose, in the interest of assuring future taxonomic stability, to designate one of the female 
syntype
as 
lectotype
for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Echinoderes pilosus
</tp:taxon-name>
with the catalogue number SMNH-3930, and consequently designate the remaining specimens as 
paralectotypes
(SMNH-1007, 9256–9282).

Description
</p>
      <p>
The species was described by 
Lang (1949)
, and more recently redescribed by 
Higgins (1986)
. However, since information from SEM not previously has been available for the species, and since the present examinations with LM and SEM resulted in substantial new information about the morphology of the species, we are here providing a full redescription.
</p>
      <p>
Adults with head, neck and eleven trunk segments. The anterior part of the trunk is relatively stout, and maximum width is reached around segments 6 and 7 (
Fig. 9
A–B). From segment 8 the segments taper significantly, giving the species an appearance of a pointed hind end (
Fig. 9
A–B). The trunk cuticle appears thin in SEM specimens (
Fig. 10A
), and tends to collapse posterior to the stronger pachycycli. Secondary pectinate fringe present near anterior segment margin on segments 2 to 10. For complete overview of measurements and dimensions, see 
Table 9
. Distribution of cuticular structures, i.e., sensory spots, glandular cell outlets, spines and tubes, is summarized in 
Table 10
.
</p>
      <p>The head consists of a retractable mouth cone and an introvert. Inner oral styles could not be examined. Nine outer oral styles are present; nine tufts with ca. six long, rigid and distally bifurcated tips in each, attach basally on the mouth cone, posterior to each outer oral style. The exact arrangement of scalids could not be examined.</p>
      <p>
The neck has 16 placids, measuring 
19 µm
in length. The midventral placid is broadest, measuring 
17 µm
in width at its base, whereas all other are narrower, measuring 
10 µm
in width at their bases.
