      <p>
Specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. taboa
</tp:taxon-name>
were found in two of the ten caves (
<tp:taxon-name>Taboa Cave</tp:taxon-name>
and BR-24 Cave) surveyed in the Bambui speleological group, near the city of Sete Lagoas, 
Minas Gerais
, 
Brazil
. The caves are located less than 
500 m
apart and likely connected by meso-caverns (

Vasconcelos 
et al
. 2016

). About fifteen adults and 
ten juveniles
were observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>Taboa Cave</tp:taxon-name>
, all in the inner part, near a large watercourse. Adults were mainly found on the walls and ceiling of the cave, whereas juveniles were often under rocks. Specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. taboa
</tp:taxon-name>
were only found in the deepest part of the BR-24 Cave. Six specimens were found during the dry season and only one during the rainy season. Potential prey species observed in the cave included moths and crickets. One specimen was observed preying on a noctuid moth during the day. The external native vegetation and rock outcrops surrounding these caves are severely degraded or in some cases completely destroyed by human activites, such as mining.
