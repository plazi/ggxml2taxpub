      <p> Diagnosis </p>
      <p> Based on Vasconcelos et al. (2016) , this species may be separated from other
            <tp:taxon-name> Charinus </tp:taxon-name> in eastern South America by means of the
         following combination of characters: median eyes reduced, with depressed median ocular
         tubercle; lateral eyes reduced, pale; tritosternum slightly forked anteriorly; female
         gonopod sucker-like, with irregular opening and margins with small fold; male gonopod with
         pairs of PI and LoL1 emerging from each side of Fi with narrow prolongations, and pairs of
         LoD and LoL2 claw-shaped, emerging from interior of upper part of Fi; pedipalps sexually
         dimorphic; pedipalp femur with four or (usually) five dorsal spines and five (usually) or
         six ventral spines; pedipalp patella with six (usually) or seven dorsal spines and four
         ventral spines; leg IV distitibia sc and sf series each with five trichobothria. </p>

      <p> Natural history </p>
      <p> Specimens of <tp:taxon-name> C. taboa </tp:taxon-name> were found in two of the ten caves
         ( <tp:taxon-name>Taboa Cave</tp:taxon-name> and BR-24 Cave) surveyed in the Bambui
         speleological group, near the city of Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais , Brazil . The caves are
         located less than 500 m apart and likely connected by meso-caverns ( Vasconcelos et al .
         2016 ). About fifteen adults and ten juveniles were observed in <tp:taxon-name>Taboa
            Cave</tp:taxon-name> , all in the inner part, near a large watercourse. Adults were
         mainly found on the walls and ceiling of the cave, whereas juveniles were often under
         rocks. Specimens of <tp:taxon-name> C. taboa </tp:taxon-name> were only found in the
         deepest part of the BR-24 Cave. Six specimens were found during the dry season and only one
         during the rainy season. Potential prey species observed in the cave included moths and
         crickets. One specimen was observed preying on a noctuid moth during the day. The external
         native vegetation and rock outcrops surrounding these caves are severely degraded or in
         some cases completely destroyed by human activites, such as mining. </p>
