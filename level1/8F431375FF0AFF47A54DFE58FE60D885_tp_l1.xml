            <p> Diagnosis </p>
            <p> This species may be separated from <tp:taxon-name> C. madagascariensis
                  </tp:taxon-name> and other African species of <tp:taxon-name> Charinus
                  </tp:taxon-name> by means of the following combination of characters: median and
                  lateral eyes well developed; cheliceral claw with nine teeth; pedipalp tarsus with
                  two dorsal spines. The count of nine teeth on the cheliceral claw is greater than
                  in any other known African species of <tp:taxon-name> Charinus </tp:taxon-name>

            <p> Redescription </p>
            <p> CARAPACE. Six short anterior setae ( Fig. 89A ); frontal process triangular. Small
                  granules densely scattered between ocular triads and among sulci. Median eyes well
                  developed, median ocular tubercle shallow, with pair of setae ( Fig. 89A );
                  lateral eyes well developed, seta posterior to lateral ocular triad; lateral
                  ocular triad well separated from carapace margin. </p>
            <p>STERNUM. Tritosternum projected anteriorly, with typical setation, short, only
                  reaching base of pedipalp coxae; other sternal platelets narrow, with pair of
                  setae anteriorly on plaque and some smaller setae posteriorly; pentasternum with
                  four setae anteriorly and without seta in membranous region.</p>
            <p>OPISTHOSOMA. Ventral sacs and ventral sac cover absent.</p>
            <p>GENITALIA. Male gonopod with border of fistula and lateral lobe slightly sclerotized;
                  lateral lobe 2 fimbriate.</p>
            <p>CHELICERAE. Small, flat tooth on retrolateral surface of basal segment, opposite to
                  bifid tooth; retrolateral surface of claw with discontinous row of setae, basally
                  to medially; claw with nine teeth; row of seven or eight setae on prolateral
                  surface of basal segment; bifid tooth on basal segment with dorsal cusp larger
                  than ventral cusp.</p>
            <p> PEDIPALPS. Coxal dorsal carina with two setae encircled by round carina and three
                  setae on margin. Femur with four dorsal spines, last spine very small, and four
                  ventral spines ( Fig. 89B–C ); small spine between dorsal spines 2 and 3, and two
                  or three spines distal to spine 4; two small spines between ventral spines 2 and
                  3, spine between spines 3 and 4, and two spines distal to spine 4; small spine
                  proximal to ventral spine 1 ( Fig. 89C ); two prominent setae and two small
                  setiferous tubercles between dorsal spine 1 and proximal margin. Patella with
                  three dorsal spines and two prominent setiferous tubercles proximally ( Fig. 89B
                  ); prominent setiferous tubercle distal to spine I, one-third length of spine I;
                  four ventral spines, distal two spines small, slightly larger than setiferous
                  tubercle; three or four small setiferous tubercles between spine I and distal
                  margin. Tibia with ventral spine distally and two setae between spine and distal
                  margin. Tarsus with two dorsal spines, distal spine half length of tarsus and
                  proximal spine onethird length of distal spine; cleaning organ with 22–23 setae in
                  ventral row. </p>
            <p> LEGS. Tibia of leg I with 23 articles; first tarsal article almost half length of
                  second article. Leg IV basitibia with four pseudo-articles, trichobothrium bt
                  situated in proximal third of pseudo-article; distitibia trichobothrium bc
                  situated closer to sbf than to bf , sc and sf series each with five trichobothria. </p>
