         <tp:taxon-name>
Mesanthura antenniformis
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
differs from previously recorded species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Mesanthura
</tp:taxon-name>
in the following unique characteristics: second article of antenna strongly projected and winding on the distal margin; palm of pereopod 1 straight. Between the three eastern Pacific species (

), 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. antenniformis
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
is more similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M
. 
occidentalis
</tp:taxon-name>
, described from Point Conception, California, by the following characteristics: (1) last article of mandibular palp with five setae, (2) dorsal surface of the telson with some setae; however, differs because in that 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. antenniformis
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
has a dense pigmentation pattern, the palm of pereopod 1 is straight with the distal margin crenulate, propodus of pereopod 2 with setulated scales, apical part of the telson slightly emarginated and with six pair of setae, while, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. occidentalis
</tp:taxon-name>
has a slightly pigmented body in a circular pattern, palm of pereopod 1 medially projected, propodus of pereopod 2 with cuticular scales and the telson has eight pairs of setae.
