Description of myxospores
(
Fig. 1
)
</p>
      <p>
Mature spores were ovoid to subspherical in frontal view and lenticular in lateral view (
Fig. 1
A–B). The valves were relatively thick, without edge markings. Intercapsular processes were absent. The spore size was 10.7 ± 0.14 (10–11.5) µm long, 9 ±0.15 (8–10) μm wide and 6.2± 0.7 (5.6–7.2) μm thick. The two ovoid polar capsules were equal in size, converging and opening together at the anterior end of the same pore (
Fig. 1A
, C–D). They measured 5± 0.07 (4.3–6.0) μm in length and 2.7± 0.07 (2.2–3.0) μm in width. Polar filaments were coiled from 5 to 7 turns perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the polar capsules (
Fig. 1D
). A sporoplasm containing an iodinophilous vacuole of varying shape and size filled the entire space below the polar capsules (
Fig. 1A
).
</p>
      <p>
Clinical finding and histopathology
</p>
      <p>
Based solely on gross observation of the fish, no signs of disease were observed. Parasitized fish harbored cysts on skin, muscles and spleen. On skin, white cysts up to 
2 mm
long were collected from the body flanks of some fish (
Fig. 2A
). Sections revealed that plasmodia developed in the connective tissue of the dermis beneath the underside of scales (
Fig. 2B
). Plasmodia were flattened and surrounded by a thin membrane and an internal endoplasm comprising a loosely defined matrix containing developed spores (
Fig. 2B
).
</p>
      <p>
Some plasmodia were spotted within muscle cells (
Fig. 2C
). Plasmodia were spindle-shaped, centrally located in the cell and not surrounded by a visible wall. No evidence of inflammation or immune-cell recruitment was seen. The integrity of myofibrils within the infected fibers showed some degree of lysis, with partial loss of myofibrillar details and striations (
Fig. 2
C–D). These lesions were observed close to plasmodia. Mature spores were scattered in the cytoplasm of infected cells (
Fig. 2D
).
</p>
      <p>
Infected spleens had plasmodia of up to 2.5 × 
1.5 mm
(
Fig. 3A
). They were white, isolated or clustered (
Fig. 3B
). Some infected spleens were heavily infected and plasmodia were randomly distributed in the whole organ. In these cases, abnormal enlargement of the spleen was evident (
Fig. 3C
). Histological sections revealed that, for moderately infected spleens, cysts were either fixed to the external region of the organ (
Fig. 3D
) or completely implanted within it (
Fig. 3E
). Development of cysts in the spleen was asynchronous (
Fig. 3
D–F). Atrophy of the adjacent splenic cells surrounding the cyst was likely due to mechanical compression (
Fig. 3
F–G). Each plasmodium was surrounded by a wall of a monolayer of flat cells (
Fig. 3
F–G). The central part of the plasmodium was occupied by fully mature spores, with initial stages of development visible in the periphery (
Fig. 3G
).
