Fig. 4A
), 69–74% length of terminal segment of antennular trunk, apex acute to narrowly rounded. Cornea occupies distal third of eye surface. Disto-mesial edge of eyestalks with small tooth (
Fig. 4C
). Antennular trunk (
Fig. 5
B–E) with one strong, apically barbed, spine-like seta on dorsal apophysis of basal segment, and with two subapically flagellate spines in addition to setae, namely one spine on disto-mesial edge of median segment, and a broader one on disto-mesial edge of terminal segment. Antennal scale (

</p>
      <p>
CARAPACE (

). Carapace covers 66–93% of cephalothorax dorsally. Rostrum reaches at most to distal ⅔ of artificially straight forward-oriented eyestalks (without cornea). Cervical sulcus distinct. Posterior margin leaves 0.5–2.5 posterior thoracic somites mid-dorsally exposed. Carapace shape as in 
Fig. 2F
, but with longer rostrum as in 
Fig. 4A.
</p>
      <p>
EYES (
Fig. 4A, C
). Eyestalks and cornea dorsoventrally weakly compressed. Eyestalks with scales along basal half to ⅔ of mesial margin. In dorsal view, cornea appears calotte-shaped, measuring 0.5–1.0 times length of eyestalk (cornea not included). In lateral view the cornea appears ovoid, length 1.1–1.3 times maximum width.
</p>
      <p>

Colour

      <p>
PHOTOS FROM BREST (
Fig. 8
A–B). General appearance transparent with yellow to orange-brown portions, rendering contents of foregut and alimentary canal visible. Small orange to brown chromatophore spots scattered over the thorax, with greatest density above the foregut. The reflecting spots above the foregut may be due to small oil globules (usually disappearing in ethanol-preserved material). Eggs are green, as often found in species of

PHOTO FROM LONDON (
Fig. 8C
). Compared with the figures from Brest, the figure from London shows an essentially similar density of chromatophores, but more ‘expanded’ ones, giving the animal a more intensive orange to red tinge. The differences between 
Fig. 8
A–B and 
Fig. 8C
are well within the range of normal colour change in species of the family

The species is so far known only from tanks in the ‘Horniman Museum Aquarium London’ (
UK
), the ‘Oceanopolis Aquarium’ in Brest (
France
), the ‘Aquarium de Paris’ (
France
), and the ‘Zoo Wroclaw’ (
Poland
). The data from Paris suggest a Caribbean origin (

Eggs and larvae
</p>
      <p>
MATERIAL FROM LONDON. Two females with empty brood pouch, while another female with 
5.3 mm
body length carried three postnauplioid larvae at substage P2 with 
1.28–1.35 mm
length, one female 
6.1 mm
carried three P2 with 
1.23–1.35 mm
. A crude estimate suggests that the larvae attain ¼ parent length shortly before the moult to the free-living juvenile stage.
</p>
      <p>
MATERIAL FROM WROCLAW. Female with 
6.1 mm
body length carried one nauplioid larva at substage N1 (
0.92 mm
length); female 
6.5 mm
carried two eggs with diameter 
0.49 mm
and eight N1-larvae with 
0.87–1.11 mm
. The co-occurrence of eggs and N1-larvae in the same brood pouch is rarely found. This indicates that the embryos were asynchronously hatching from the egg membrane shortly before and during fixation. The observed strong size differences between the hatchlings are clearly due to the obligatory stretching of the abdomen during and shortly after hatching. Adoption of eggs or larvae from other mothers appears unlikely in this case: in experiments of 
Wittmann (1978)
with mysids from other subfamilies, the breeding females did not introduce offered eggs (embryos) into their brood pouch, but a few mothers did so with up to two nauplioid larvae, never with more. The here studied N1-larvae show a smooth cuticle all around.
