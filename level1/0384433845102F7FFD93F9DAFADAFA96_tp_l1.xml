Description based on the 
lectotype
</p>
      <p>
Female
</p>
      <p>
MEASUREMENTS. Body length 
7.1 mm
; fore wing length 
4.4 mm
.
</p>
      <p>HEAD. Face about 0.80–0.90 × as high as wide. Malar space 0.5–0.6 × width of mandibular base. Gena about 0.4 × as long as eye (maximum width, seen laterally); temple 0.3 × as long as eye (see dorsally), narrowed behind eye, imaginary lines connecting outer side of eye and temple intersect not before the level of the scutellar groove or just behind it. OOD 0.65 × distance between lateral ocelli. Mandibular teeth subequal. Clypeus 0.4–0.5 × as high as wide, not produced in profile medially, matt and coriaceous, its apical margin sharp and gently rounded. Face and frons granulate and matt. Vertex and temples coriaceous and subpolished. Flagellum in the examined specimen with 33 segments, flagellomeres in apical quarter about 0.8–0.9 × as long as wide.</p>
      <p>MESOSOMA. Pronotum medio-ventrally with longitudinal striae, dorsally coriaceous. Epomia indistinct. Mesoscutum and scutellum granulate and matt, scutellum without lateral carinae. Mesopleuron coriaceous and matt, with shallow and scattered punctures, especially on antero-ventral half; speculum smooth, anteriorly with fine longitudinal striae. Epicnemial carina only slightly sinuate subventrally, ventrally slightly raised, in middle without notch and not produced into lobes. Metapleuron coriaceous and matt. Fore wing with areolet small and petiolate, 2m-cu beyond its middle; 1cu-a opposite M&amp;RS. Hind wing with proximal abscissa of CU 4.5 × as long as cu-a, distal abscissa of CU unpigmented. Hind femur 4.5 × as long as its maximum width, the longer inner tibial spur about 0.5–0.6 × as long as hind basitarsus. Propodeum with area basalis triangular and connected by a small longitudinal carina to anterior margin of area superomedia, at its anterior end about 0.4 × as wide as area superomedia (width at level of costulae); area superomedia large, about 1.4 × as wide as long, coriaceous and matt, not depressed and open posteriorly, with few transverse striae at its lateral margins. Area petiolaris very slightly depressed and with irregular transverse striae. Rim of propodeal spiracle and carina connecting propodeal spiracle to pleural carina normal.</p>
      <p>METASOMA. Postpetiole coriaceous. Metasomal tergite II 1.6 × as long as posteriorly wide. Ovipositor ratio about 1.6.</p>
      <p>COLOUR. Black. Palps and tegulae yellowish-white. Mandibles (except black base and reddish teeth) and pedicel apically yellow. Scape and flagellum yellowish-brown, flagellum lighter distally. Pterostigma yellowish-brown. All coxae black, fore coxa yellow marked distally, all tibial spurs yellowish-white; fore and mid trochanters and trochantelli yellow, fore and mid femora, tibiae and tarsi yellowish-red. Hind trochanter and trochantellus brownish, hind femur red, hind tibia and tarsus yellowish-red, tibia with very small light spot at base, slightly brownish subbasally. Metasoma and ovipositor sheath black.</p>

Notes
</p>
      <p>
The examined specimen, which we designate as the 
lectotype
, does not fit the description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Campoplex tibialis
</tp:taxon-name>
, as the ovipositor ratio is clearly greater than that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. tibialis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Also, the specimen is characterized by the temple, in lateral view, at most 0.4–0.5 × as long as the transverse diameter of the eye and the propodeum with the area basalis triangular (as in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Campoplex angustioranae
(Bauer, 1937)
</tp:taxon-name>
; 
Horstmann 1985
). These reasons led us to remove 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. corsicator
</tp:taxon-name>
from synonymy with 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. tibialis
(
Horstmann, 1985
)
