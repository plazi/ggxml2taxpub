Antennae slender, filiform, more than 18-segmented. Scapus 1.5 times as long as its maximum width. First flagellar segment about 5.0 times as long as its apical width. Subapical segments 4.0–4.3 times as long as width.</p>
      <p>MESOSOMA. Length 2.1 times its height. Pronotal carina weak, distances from carina to anterior margin of pronotum about 6.0 times distance from carina to posterior margin. Mesoscutum not highly and roundly elevated above pronotum (lateral view), almost as long as median width (dorsal view). Notauli entirely deep, rather wide, finely crenulate. Median lobe of mesoscutum with shallow median furrow. Prescutellar depression rather shallow, distinctly and roundly oblique postero-laterally, entirely distinctly sculptured, 0.5 times as long as the convex scutellum. Sternaulus (precoxal furrow) rather narrow, entirely granulate-coriaceous, running along almost entire length of lower part of mesopleuron. Prepectal carina below without widened lobes opposite fore coxae. Subalar depression rather deep, narrow, crenulate and fine additional reticulation between crenulae. Metanotum with very short and subpointed tooth directed backwards (lateral view). Metapleural lobe short, wide, subpointed apically, without dense pubescence.</p>
      <p>WINGS. Fore wing 4.0 times its maximum width. Metacarpus (1-R1) weakly longer than pterostigma. First radial abscissa (r) forming almost straight angle with second abscissa (3-SR). Second radial abscissa (3-SR) 2.7 times as long as first abscissa (r), 0.4 times as long as the weakly sinuate third abscissa (SR1), 1.6 times as long as first radiomedial vein (2-SR). Second radiomedial (submarginal) cell rather long, weakly widened distally, about 3.0 times as long as wide, 1.2 times as long as brachial (subdiscal) cell. First medial abscissa (1-SR+M) weakly sinuate. Discoidal (discal) cell 2.5 times as long as maximum width. Mediocubital vein (M+CU1) weakly curved to anal vein (2-1A) in distal half. Distance between nervulus (cu-a) and basal (1-M) vein 1.3 times nervulus (cu-a) length. Brachial (subdiscal) cell narrow, gently-roundly closed distinctly before level of recurrent vein; posterior bulla and posterior abscissa of longitudinal anal vein (behind brachial vein (CU1b)) absent. Hind wing about 5.0 times as long as wide. First costal abscissa (C+SC+R) 0.5 times as long as second abscissa (1-SC+R). First abscissa of mediocubital vein (M+CU) about 0.4 times as long as second abscissa (1-M).</p>
      <p>LEGS. Hind femur with distinct dorsal protuberance, length of femur 2.8 times its maximum width. Hind tarsus almost as long as hind tibia. Hind basitarsus 0.5 times length of second–fifth segments combined. Second tarsal segment 0.55 times as long as basitarsus, 1.1 times as long as fifth segment (without pretarsus).</p>
      <p>METASOMA. Length 1.2 times as long as head and mesosoma combined, with six dorsally visible tergites. First tergite without subbasal lateral processes. Maximum width of first tergite about twice its basal width; its length almost equal to apical width, 1.1 times length of propodeum. Median length of second tergite 0.7 times its basal width, 1.8 times length of third tergite; median length of apical area 1.4 times length of rest part of tergite. Second suture deep and rather wide. Fifth tergite straight in posterior margin, without median emargination and postero-ventral lobes. Fifth tergite 1.4 times as long as fourth tergite, almost twice as long as than third or sixth tergites. Ovipositor sheath 0.6 times as long as metasoma, 1.4 times as long as hind tibia, 0.9 times as long as mesosoma, 0.4 times as long as fore wing.</p>
      <p>SCULPTURE AND PUBESCENCE. Vertex distinctly densely granulate, with additional distinct, weakly undulate and rather dense transverse striae; frons densely granulate and with distinct curved striae directed from lateral sides towards middle; face medially finely granulate-coriaceous, smooth or almost smooth widely laterally; temple granulate with curved striation, finely granulate to coriaceous or smooth in lower third. Mesoscutum entirely densely and distinctly granulate, without rugosity along notauli and laterally, with short rugosity in medio-posterior 0.3 of mesoscutum. Scutellum mostly smooth, coriaceous anteriorly. Mesopleuron entirely densely granulate. Metapleuron rugose-reticulate with granulation. Propodeum small areolate-rugulose with granulation, with granulate and indistinctly delineated by carinae basolateral areas, without areola. Hind coxa mostly smooth, finely granulate dorsally. Hind femur coriaceous in upper half and almost smooth in lower half. First tergite with rather distinct, almost complete and weakly convergent dorsal carinae, distinctly coarsely striate with fine reticulation between striae, smooth in medio-basal 0.4 and in medio-apical small area. Second tergite basally coarsely and curvedly striate, its apical area finely and subtransversely striate. Third and fourth tergites in basal 0.3 (medially) – 0.7 (laterally) distinctly curvedly striate, almost transversely striate medially, smooth in apical parts. Fifth tergite rugulose-striate in basal 0.2–0.3, finely reticulate to smooth on most part. Second–fourth tergites laterally almost entirely densely striate with reticulation. Vertex entirely with short, sparse and semi-erect pale setae. Mesoscutum with rather sparse, short and semi-erect setae arranged widely along notauli and narrowly marginally, with narrow glabrous median areas on all lobes. Mesopleuron almost entirely covered by sparse pale setae. Hind tibia dorsally with rather long, more or less dense and semi-erect pale setae; length of these setae 0.5–1.0 times maximum width of hind tibia.</p>
