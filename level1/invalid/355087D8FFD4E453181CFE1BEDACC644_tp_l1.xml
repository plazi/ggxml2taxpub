Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
This is the smallest of all Bornean species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chassalia
</tp:taxon-name>
, differing from all other species in being just 
25–30 cm
tall (other species are at least 
40 cm
tall, and usually a minimum of 
1 m
tall), in the obovate leaves just 
5.5–7.5 cm
long (in other species they exceed 
10 cm
long and may attain 
48 cm
long), in the apex of leaves obtuse (acute or acuminate in most other species), in having large white fruits 8 × 7 × 
7 mm
(all other species have blue or purple or black fruits), in having a large bony spine 2 × 1 × 
0.5 mm
on the ventral surface of the pyrene.

      <p>
Herb, 
25–30 cm
tall, glabrous, almost half of the plant growing among mosses. Stem 
1–2 mm
wide, usually producing adventitious roots 
1–8cm
below lowest internode, internodes 
1.8–3.5 cm
long, lower internodes terete, upper internodes drying flat, slightly canaliculate. Leaf-blades narrowly obovate to oblanceolate, coriaceous, adaxially dark green, abaxially light yellowish-green, (2.5–)4–6.5 × 
1.3– 1.8 cm
; apex obtuse, base attenuate; midrib slightly raised both adaxially and abaxially, secondary nerves 7–12 on each side, tertiary nerves not visible; petiole short, 
5–10 mm
long. Stipule flabellate, 5–7 × 
4–5 mm
. Inflorescences short, 
4.5 cm
long, peduncle 
3.5 cm
× 
0.8 mm
, broadening near apex to 
2 mm
wide, bracts of first internode of rachis and first branches 4, broadly elliptic, 4.5 × 
2–3.5 mm
; first internode of rachis and first branches very short to absent, usually less than 
1 mm
; bracts of capitulum 4–6 or more, 4–4.5 × 
1–4.5 mm
, with crystal bodies on each rachis bract and capitulum bract. Flowers 
6–12 in
each capitulum, open flowers not seen; hypanthium 
1.5–2 mm
long, calyx tube 
0.7 mm
long, apex slightly curved. Corolla white, glabrous, 
1–1.8 cm
long in bud, tube slightly broadened at apex, 
5 mm
long before opening, 
1 mm
wide at base, apex 
2.5–3 mm
wide, band of hairs 
1 mm
wide, at base of stamens 
1–2 mm
from mouth of corolla tube, hairs erect, colourless, 
0.1–0.2 mm
long; open flower not seen. Stamens 1 × 
0.5 mm
, slightly concave, base bifurcate, inserted ca 
1.5 mm
from mouth of corolla, filaments very short to absent. Stigma bilobed, lobes orbiculate, 
0.6 mm
diameter. Disc cylindric, 
0.4 mm
long, 
0.7 mm
wide, apex flat. Fruits sessile, ellipsoid, 7–8 × 7 × 
7 mm
, pure white; calyx persistent, not accrescent, 1 × 
2 mm
, disc persistent, not accrescent, 0.5 × 
1 mm
. Pyrenes plano-convex, 7–8 × 6–7 × 
4 mm
, dorsal surface convex, with two adjacent parallel longitudinal crests, 
1 mm
wide, 
1 mm
high, 
0.5 mm
apart along their length, forming a longitudinal groove from apex to base between the two crests; ventral surface concave, central part slightly elevated, margin with an endocarpal outgrowth 
0.2 mm
wide, with a groove between the edge of endocarp and endocarpal outgrowth 
0.2 mm
wide. Raphal opening at base of the endocarpal outgrowth, round, 
0.5 mm
wide, 
0.2–0.3 mm
from the edge of the pyrene wall, apex with a bony spine, flabellate, 2 × 1 ×
