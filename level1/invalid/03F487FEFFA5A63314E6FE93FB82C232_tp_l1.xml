Description
</p>
      <p>
All features of the Diagnosis. Size of adult females 
3.3–4.2 mm
, males 
3.4–4.8 mm
. Cephalothorax comprises 22–33% body length, pleon (without telson) 50–65%, carapace (without rostrum) 20–25%, and rostrum 4–5%. Abdominal somites 1–5 measure 0.6–0.8, 0.6–0.9, 0.6–0.8, 0.5–0.9, and 0.6–0.9 times the length of somite 6, respectively.
</p>
      <p>
CARAPACE (
Fig. 2
F–H). Carapace covers 65–87% of cephalothorax dorsally. Rostrum reaches at most to distal ⅔ of artificially straight forward-oriented eyestalks (without cornea). Cervical and cardial sulcus short but distinct. Posterior margin leaving 0.8–1.5 posterior thoracic somites mid-dorsally exposed. Cervical pore group formed by 8–11 pores each with about 
1 µm
diameter arranged in a wide arc (
Fig. 2G
). The posterior group of pores (
Fig. 2H
) closely behind cardial sulcus; it consists of 10–12 such pores, each with about 
1.2 µm
diameter surrounding a larger but indistinct, rounded structure.
</p>
      <p>
EYES (
Fig. 1
A–C). Eyestalks and cornea dorsoventrally strongly compressed. Eyestalks without scales. In dorsal view the cornea appears calotte-shaped, measuring 0.6–0.9 times the length of eyestalk (cornea not included). In lateral view (
Fig. 1B
) the cornea appears kidney-shaped, length 1.6 times maximum width.
</p>
      <p>
ANTENNULAE (
Fig. 2
A–D). Trunk extends 46–61% its length beyond eyes, 15–33% beyond antennal scale. Measured along dorsal midline, the basal segment is 32–47% trunk length, median segment 12– 18%, and terminal segment 38–49%. Basal segment on basal half of its outer face with two small, stout, barbed setae (
Fig. 2D
). Its dorsal apophysis with 3–2 barbed setae, one flagelliform seta, and one flagellate spine (
Fig. 2C
). Lateral apophysis with one plumose and one shorter barbed seta, and one flagelliform seta. Median segment dorsally with large apophysis with 3–4 barbed plus one flagelliform seta. Terminal segment 1.4–1.5 times as long as wide. Its mid-dorsal apophysis with 4–2 barbed setae. Disto-mesial edge of terminal segment with flagellate spine (
Fig. 2B
) resembling certain flagellate spines (
Fig. 2P
) of gnathopods. In both sexes the outer antennular flagellum is thicker than the inner one by a factor of 1.5–2.3 when measured near basis of flagella. Male lobe well setose, inserts ventrally close to terminal margin of antennular trunk, almost spherical, length is 20–24% width of terminal segment of trunk, its width 19–26%.
</p>
      <p>
ANTENNAE (
Fig. 2E
). Three-segmented antennal peduncle: basal segment is 18–23% peduncle length, second segment 43–49%, and third segment 29–32%. Sympod with tongue-like process on ventral face.
</p>
      <p>
MOUTHPARTS (
Fig. 2
I–K). Labrum not produced into a spiniform process; caudally with small, stiff bristles, fields of setae on caudal and ventral faces. Mandibular palp (
Fig. 2I
) three-segmented. Its proximal segment without setae, 10–15% length of palp. Length of median segment 2.1–2.3 times its maximum width and 65–72% palp length. Inner margin of median segment with two smooth setae in subapical and subbasal position, respectively, and with 6–7 modified setae along proximal half in both sexes. These setae increasing in length distally; their basal half thickened, bearing unilateral series of stiff barbs; distal half with smooth flagellum (
Fig. 2K
). Mid-caudal face with 0–1 weakly barbed seta, outer margin with smooth setae all along. Rostral face only in males with longitudinal series of scales near inner margin from subbasal to subterminal portions; scales triangular, facing distally, arranged in groups formed by mostly 7–9 peripheral scales around a central scale (
Fig. 2J
). Terminal segment strongly setose, 17–21% palp length. Pars molaris with well-developed grinding surface in both mandibles. Pars incisiva with 4–5 teeth, digitus mobilis with 3–4 teeth, and pars centralis with 3–4 spiny teeth. Labium normal, comprising two hairy lobes with dense set of stiff bristles on distal half of inner face. Maxillula as normal in this genus; distal segment terminally with 11–12 mostly smooth, in part weakly serrated spines; subterminally with three setae barbed on their distal half; transverse series of three pores closely adjoining the outer (= most ventral) seta. Endite of maxillula terminally with three strong, distally spiny setae accompanied by 3–4 proximally thick, barbed setae; inner and outer margins with numerous less thick setae. Maxilla as normal in this genus; terminal segment of endopod with maximum width 53– 66% length. Outer margin of exopod all along with 16–19 mostly plumose setae, the two apical setae larger than the remaining ones.

      <p>
THORACOPODS (general; 
Figs 2
L–S, 3C–G). Length of flagella as well as of basal plates increases from exopod 1 to 6, and decreases from exopod 6 to 8. Basal plates (
Fig. 3F
) expanded, 1.7–2.3 times as long as wide in both sexes. Outer margin of the plates ends in a well-rounded edge. First thoracopods with large, leaf-like, smooth epipod. As in many species of this genus, a plumose seta plus a shorter barbed seta present at the intersegmental joint connecting sympod of thoracopod 2 with corresponding thoracic sternite; no such setae in remaining thoracopods. Length of ischium and total length of endopod increase in series of thoracopods 1, 2, 4, 3, 5–8. Basis of endopods 4–8 (
Fig. 3F
) with a small, lappet-like apophysis on rostral face below endopod. Ischium becomes more slender from endopods 1 to 5, and its shape remains subequal among endopods 5–8. Ischium shorter than merus in endopods 1–4 (
Fig. 2L, O
), but longer than merus in endopods 5–8 (
Fig. 3F
). Thoracic endopods with claw 3 longest; claws 1, 4–8 (
Figs 2R
, 
3
D–E, G) about half as long as claw 3; claw 2 not detected (presence not excluded). Claws 1, 5–8 subapically unilaterally serrated (

</p>
      <p>MAXILLIPEDS. Coxa of first maxilliped with small endite bearing one barbed seta at tip. Basis with large, prominent endite that is densely setose on inner margin. Ischium and merus each with one smaller but distinct, medially setose endite. Basis of second maxilliped with large, distinctly medially projecting endite. In both sexes, combined praeischium plus ischium are 0.7–0.9 times length of merus, carpopropodus plus dactylus 1.0–1.2 times merus. Dactylus very large, with dense brush formed by large numbers of normal setae and 10–12 modified setae, the latter apically bent, bearing two symmetrical series of denticles (stiff barbs) on either side in subbasal to median portions.</p>

Subterminal seta without, remaining setae at end of thickened portion with 1–2 modified, spine-like barbs; mainly two such ‘spines’ in males (
Fig. 2N
), only one in females (
Fig. 2Q
). Proximal 60–80% of merus with 3–7 short whip setae on mesial margin, whip setae alternating with longer smooth setae; no tooth-like projections. Carpus with flagellate spines (
Fig. 2M, P
) arranged as two single spines and more distally two pairs of spines; all these spines with subapical flagellum positioned on smooth posterior (proximal) face; four distal spines rugged to various degrees on anterior face.

Larvae
</p>
      <p>
In the ethanol-fixed material, three out of six adult females examined had 1–2 nauplioid larvae in the brood pouch; three lacked a brood. A female with 
4.2 mm
body length carried two nauplioid larvae at substage N1 with 
0.66–0.69 mm
, a female of 
3.9 mm
had one N3 with 
0.78 mm
, and a female of 
3.6 mm
had one N4 with 
0.84 mm
. Larvae at substages N3 and N4 with smooth cuticle all around. The two N
