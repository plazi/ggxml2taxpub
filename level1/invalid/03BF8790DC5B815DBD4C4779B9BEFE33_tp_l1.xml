      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name> Russula minor </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. is mainly characterized by its very
         small basidiocarp with thin context and pink to rosy pileus less than 2.5 cm in diam.,
         pileipellis very easy to peel off, white to cream lamellae with few lamellulae, often
         curved and hollow to multi-chambered stipe, spores with conical to cylindrical warts never
         connected, very small basidia and gelatinized pileipellis with slender terminal cells and
         abundant pileocystidia, and pleurocystidia weakly SV+ (slightly becoming brownish) or SV-,
         while pileocystidia becoming brown in SV. </p>

      <p> Description </p>
      <p> Basidiocarp very small (pileus diameter less than 3 cm ). Pileus 0.8–2.5 cm in diam.,
         hemispherical to convex when young, turning applanate with depressed center or
         infundibuliform at maturity; surface dry, viscid when wet, sometimes slightly villose at
         center, easy to peel to 2/3 radius, white (#FFFAFA) to pinkish (#FAEBD7) at margin, pink,
         fuchsia pink to rosy (#F97D8E, # C85868 , #DF828F) at center; margin smooth and entire at
         first, turning striate with age, sometimes cracked. Lamellae adnate, dense at first,
         becoming scattered with age, interveined, white when young, turning yellowish cream
         (#FCF3CF, #FEF9E7) at maturity; edge concolorous, smooth; lamellulae irregularly dispersed.
         Stipe central, fleshy, fragile, cylindrical, often curved, solid at first, turning hollow
         to multi-chambered with age, 0.7–1.2 × 0.2–0.4 cm , white to yellowish cream (#FCF3CF,
         #F8F9C2), sometimes slightly villose. Context white, sometimes yellowing at lower part of
         the stipe; taste mild; odor indistinct. Spore print pale cream (#F3E2A9). </p>
      <p>Basidiospores subglobose to ellipsoid, rarely globose, (40/2/2) (5.0–)5.3–5.8–6.1(–6.6) ×
         (4.1–) 4.3–4.6–4.9(–5.2) μm, [Q = (1.11–)1.15–1.22–1.30], hyaline in 5% KOH; ornamentation
         amyloid, conical to cylindrical warts less than 1.5 μm in height, mostly isolated, rarely
         fused into short crest, but not reticulate; suprahilar spot amyloid. Basidia clavate, 2- or
         4-spored, thin-walled, with irregular contents or dorplets, small,
         (17–)17.5–21–27(–29.5)×7–8.5–9.5(–10) μm; sterigmata 2.2–4.8 ×0.9–1.7 μm. Pleurocystidia
         subcylindrical to fusiform, with obtuse, papillate or mucronate apices, thin-walled, with
         irregular refractive contents, weakly SV+ or SV-, 26.5–36–48(–52.5)×4–6–7 μm.
         Cheilocystidia similar to pleurocystidia, but shorter, 20–31–40(–47) in length. Subhymenium
         pseudoparenchymatous. Lamellar trama composed of numerous sphaerocytes surrounded by
         connective hyphae, sphaerocytes measuring 21–28 μm in diam. Pileipellis 60–120 μm thick,
         gelatinized, composed of ascending to erect hyphae; hyphae cylindrical, thin-walled,
         hyaline, sometimes branched, 1.5–4 μm wide; terminal cells cylindrical, slender, with
         obtuse or tapering apices, thin-walled, hyaline, (7–)8–18–31(–44) × 2–2.5–3.5 μm.
         Pileocystidia one-celled, abundant, subcylindrical to subclavate, obtuse or papillate,
         sometimes branched, with refractive contents, becoming brown in SV, (15.5–)16–46–106(–130)
         × 3–4.5–6.5 μm. Stipitipellis a cutis, composed of cylindrical, septate, thin-walled,
         hyaline hyphae measuring 1-3 μm in diam.; terminal cells cylindrical with obtuse apices,
         hyaline, 9–13.5–16(–18) ×2.5–3–4 μm. Caulocystidia subcylindrical, with obtuse apices, with
         irregular refractive contents, becoming brown in SV, (16.5–)21–35–62(–85.5)× 3–5–6.5 μm.
         Clamp connections absent in all tissues.</p>
