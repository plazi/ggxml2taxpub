            <p> This species may be separated from other species of <tp:taxon-name> Sarax
                  </tp:taxon-name> in Southeast Asia and Oceania by the following combination of
                  characters: chelicera without retrolateral tooth on basal segment opposite to
                  bifid tooth; cheliceral claw with three teeth; pedipalp femur with four or five
                  dorsal spines and four or five ventral spines ( Fig. 105E–F ); pedipalp patella
                  with three dorsal spines and two ventral spines ( Fig. 105E–F ); leg IV basitibia
                  with four pseudo-articles and trichobothrium bt situated distally; distitibia
                  trichobothrium bc situated closer to bf than to sbf ; sc and sf series each with
                  five trichobothria. </p>
            <p> This species resembles <tp:taxon-name> S. sarawakensis </tp:taxon-name> , but
                  possesses fewer teeth on the cheliceral claw and more spines on the pedipalp
                  femur. </p>

            <p> Description </p>

                  Median eyes well developed ( Fig. 105A, C ); median ocular tubercle reduced; pair
                  of setae on median ocular tubercle; lateral eyes well developed, seta lateral to
                  lateral ocular triad; lateral ocular triad near carapace margin; curved carina
                  between ocular triads and lateral margin of carapace ( Fig. 105C ). </p>
            <p> STERNUM. Tritosternum anteriorly projected with typical setation ( Fig. 105B );
                  other sternal platelets narrow and concave, with pair of setae anteriorly on
                  plaque and some smaller setae posteriorly; pentasternum four setae anteriorly and
                  without seta on membranous region. </p>

            <p> GENITALIA. Female genital operculum with prominent setae posteromedially and some
                  smaller setae near margin, without bulges medially ( Fig. 106A–C ); gonopod with
                  pair of short, plunger-like submedian lobes unsclerotized basally ( Fig. 106A, C,
                  F ); denticulate surface between gonopod and posterior margin of genital operculum
                  ( Fig. 106D ); slit sensilla on lateral margin of genital operculum ( Fig. 106E ).

                  denticulate projection at apex of articles; trichobothrium bt situated in distal
                  third of pseudo-article; distitibia trichobothrium bc situated closer to bf than
                  to s bf ; sc and sf series each with five trichobothria. </p>

            <p>The three ovigerous females are different sizes, suggesting different developmental
                  stages. The small female does not appear to be a fully developed adult and the
                  possession of eggs at an early stage of development suggests this species may be
                  parthenogenetic.</p>
