                        1910) </tp:taxon-name> from Indonesia ( Belokobylskij 2001b ), but differs
                  from the latter by having the posterior lenticular area of the second metasomal
                  tergite medially long (short in <tp:taxon-name> Rh. testaceiceps </tp:taxon-name>

                  furrows (with a deep and coarsely crenulate transverse curved furrow in

                  dorsally with semi-erect and rather dense short pale setae, length of these setae
                  0.6–0.8 times maximum width of hind tibia.</p>
            <p>COLOUR. Head mainly yellowish brown, reddish brown dorsally; mesosoma and metasoma
                  dark reddish brown or reddish brown, but sometimes dark reddish brown, metasoma
                  below mainly pale brown or almost yellow. Scape and pedicel of antenna light
                  reddish brown to reddish brown, most basal part of flagellum yellow to yellowish
                  brown, remaining short apical part of flagellum sometimes becoming brownish. Palpi
                  yellow. Legs mainly yellow, hind coxa distinctly infuscate. Ovipositor sheath
                  brown. Fore wing faintly infuscate. Pterostigma brownish yellow in basal half,
                  brown in apical half.</p>
            <p> Male </p>
            <p> Body length 2.3–2.7 mm ; fore wing length 1.6–2.1 mm . Antenna 23–26-segmented;
                  scape wide, its length 1.4 times maximum width. Metasoma 1.1–1.4 times longer than
                  head and mesosoma combined, with six dorsally visible sclerotised tergites; sixth
                  tergite finely reticulate-rugulose and almost smooth in posterior fifth. Median
                  length of second tergite (with posterior area) 1.1 times its anterior width;
                  median length of its posterior area 0.9–1.0 times median length of remaining part
                  of tergite. Fifth tergite on posterior margin almost straight, 1.0–1.2 times as
                  long as sixth tergite, 1.1–1.2 times longer than fourth tergite. Face widely
                  smooth, rugose-reticulate in upper sublateral third. </p>
