The specimens bear red labels specifying that the identification was made from comparison with Thomson’s material in Lund. We studied two females in Aubert’s collection and, after comparison with 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. difformis
</tp:taxon-name>
in Horstmann’s collection, we think they are likely 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. unicingulatus
</tp:taxon-name>
as they have the epicnemial carina evenly raised ventrally and submedially, propodeum with the area superomedia and area petiolaris only slightly depressed and with fine transverse striae starting from the base of the area petiolaris, and an ovipositor ratio of 1.5–1.6 (ovipositor ratio slightly exceeding that stated for 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. unicingulatus
</tp:taxon-name>
). In our opinion, this misidentification could be the reason that led Aubert to reject Horstmann’s interpretation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
mutabilis
</tp:taxon-name>
as a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
difformis
</tp:taxon-name>
.
