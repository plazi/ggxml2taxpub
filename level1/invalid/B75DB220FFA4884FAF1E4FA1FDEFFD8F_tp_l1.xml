Description
</p>
      <p>
Female
</p>
      <p>
Small sized nematodes, slightly curved ventrad to open C-shaped upon fixation; body cylindrical, tapering gradually towards both extremities but more so towards the anterior end. Cuticle with two distinct layers, 1.0–1.5 μm thick at midbody and 2.0–2.5 μm on tail. Outer cuticle strongly striated; inner layer thick, loose, irregular outline with distinct radial refractive elements. Lateral chords occupying about 26–36% of midbody diameter. Lateral dorsal and ventral body pores indistinct. Lip region caplike, offset by slight constriction, 1.7–2.0 times as wide as high or about ⅓ to 
2/5
of the body diameter at neck base. Lips rounded, amalgamated, inner part slightly elevated. Labial and cephalic papillae distinct but not interfering with the labial contour. Amphids cup-shaped, their aperture occupying about ⅓ to 
2/5
of lip region diameter. Stoma a truncate cone. Odontostyle 0.8 times the lip region diameter long, its aperture about ⅓ of the odontostyle length. Odontophore rod-like, as long as odontostyle, with minute basal knobs. Guiding ring simple, refractive, at 0.7–0.9 times the lip region diameter from anterior end. Pharynx consisting of a slender, slightly muscular anterior part, expanding abruptly into a cylindrical basal bulb, with thick-walled lumen, occupying about 36–41% of total neck length. Pharyngeal gland nuclei and their orifices are located as follows: DO = 62–66, DN = 65–69, DO–DN = 2.2–3.1, S1N1 = 74–77, S1N2 = 78–82, S2N = 89–91, S2O = 91–92. Nerve ring at 39–44% of neck length from anterior end. Cardia rounded conoid, about ⅓ of the corresponding body diameter long.
</p>
      <p>
Genital system monodelphic-prodelphic. Ovary reflexed, measuring 29–47 μm long; oocytes arranged in single row except near tip. Oviduct joining the ovary subterminally, measuring 42–54 μm, its proximal and distal parts not differentiated. Oviduct-uterus junction marked by well-developed sphincter. Uterus short, measuring 19–26 μm. Posterior genital branch reduced to a small uterine sac, 5.5–10.0 μm or about 
2/5
to 
3/5
of the corresponding body diameter long, rarely absent (n = 2). Sperm cell not present in the genital tract. Vagina cylindrical, extending inwards, 7.5–9.0 μm or about ½ (49–55%) of midbody diameter; pars proximalis vaginae 5.0–6.0 × 2.5–3.5 μm, encircled by circular muscles; pars distalis vaginae short, 2.5– 3.0 μm with slightly curved walls; pars refringens absent. Vulva apparently a transverse slit. Prerectum 2.6–4.5 and rectum 1.1–1.5 times anal body diameter long. Tail convex-conoid with bluntly rounded terminus, 1.1–1.3 times anal body diameter long, with a pair of caudal pores on each side.

Taxonomic remarks

0.37–0.52 mm
); absence of labial disc 
(
