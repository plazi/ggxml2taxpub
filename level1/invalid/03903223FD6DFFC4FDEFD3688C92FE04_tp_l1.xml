Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
The new species is a slender-conical 
<tp:taxon-name>
Opacuincola
</tp:taxon-name>
most similar to the smaller 
<tp:taxon-name>
Op. terraelapsus
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Opacuincola takakaensis
</tp:taxon-name>
is larger and more conical. Compared to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Op. terraelapsus
</tp:taxon-name>
, the new species has a larger bursa copulatrix reaching much farther behind the albumen gland than in the latter, and the huge penis has no subterminal swelling and has a lobe that points forward rather than to the right. Compared to all other congeners, 
<tp:taxon-name>

had 20 diagnostic DNA positions.

is dedicated to Lisanne Verhaegen, the sister of the first author, on the occasion of her 30 
th
birthday. She is in part responsible for the debut of the first author as a biologist by proofreading numerous of her applications, including the one for her PhD position, resulting in the discovery of this new species.

Description
</p>
      <p>
SHELL (
Figs 4
C–D,

B–C). Slender-conical to pupiform, about 1.8 times as high as than wide, whitetranslucent with light brown periostracum; protoconch with fine pits comprising ca 0.85 whorls (
Fig. 6
B– C); entire shell with 3.75 to 4.375 whorls, teleoconch with fine longitudinal ridges on first 0.25 whorl, then without structure apart from growth lines; umbilicus narrow; aperture orthocline, almost circular, only slightly higher than wide.
</p>
      <p>OPERCULUM. Light orange, paucispiral; nucleus submarginal, without peg.</p>
      <p>EXTERNAL FEATURES. Epidermis without pigment; eyes small with bean-shaped pigment spot; tentacles without particular ciliation.</p>
      <p>
MANTLE CAVITY (n = 5). 9–12 ctenidial filaments; osphradium ovate-elongate, behind middle of gill. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM. Radula has formula R 4-6 1 4-6/3-4 3-4, L 5-6 1 5, M1 23-26, M2 26-33 (
Fig. 8B
); stomach without caecum; intestine makes loop in roof of mantle cavity, which is clearer in males than in females due to different sizes of pallial genital glands.

FEMALE GENITALIA (n = 2; 
Fig. 10A
). Ovary short, simple sac starting 1.5 whorls below apex, comprising 0.25 whorl and not reaching stomach; renal oviduct first coiling 180° clockwise, then 270° counterclockwise; one distal, large receptaculum seminis lying ventrally against bursa copulatrix; bursa copulatrix large, ellipsoid, underneath and reaching far behind albumen gland, bursal duct entering anteriorly; ovoviviparous, brooding at least one embryo in pallial oviduct, pallial oviduct as brood pouch with short albumen gland as well as longer capsule gland, the latter histologically uniform in CT scans.
</p>
      <p>
MALE GENITALIA (n = 5; 
Fig. 10B
). Testis lobate sac, starting ca 0.75 whorl below apex, comprising ca 0.75 whorl, anteriorly just reaching stomach; vesicula seminalis coils along anterior half of testis; proximal vas deferens inserts close to middle of kidney-shaped prostate, distal vas deferens leaving anteriorly; penis large, continuously tapering, ending with broad, cylindrical filament, huge muscular lobe on right side pointing forward (

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
With respect to all other sequenced congeners, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Op. lisannea
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
had 14 diagnostic characters in COI and six in 16S, respectively (
Table 2
). In the phylogeny, it was a well-supported sister species to five other species of the genus (
Fig. 2
). Morphologically, the new species is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Op. terraelapsus
</tp:taxon-name>
. The latter is smaller (shell height, ANOVA: df = 2, 50; F= 79.17; p &lt;0.0001; Tukey’s pairwise posthoc tests: p &lt;
0.004 in
all three cases), but the species cannot be distinguished in shape (shell height/ shell width, Kruskal-Wallis test: H = 4.409; p = 0.110; pairwise Mann-Whitney U-tests: p&gt; 
0.05 in
all three cases). This is perfectly reflected in the PCA, where the species largely overlap only along PC2 (
Fig. 3
). In 
February 2016
, we again failed to find 
<tp:taxon-name>
Op. terraelapsus
</tp:taxon-name>
. It was originally collected in a trickle somewhere at the start of the Fenian track near Karamea in 1976, blocked by a landslide in 2002 when MH first attempted to relocate this species (see 
Haase 2008
). Whether 
<tp:taxon-name>
Op. terraelapsus
</tp:taxon-name>
has survived until today can only be hoped. The reduced eyes suggest that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Op. lisannea
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
dwells in the transition zone of epigean and ground waters. At the 
type
locality of the new species, we also collected
