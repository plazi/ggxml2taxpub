            <p> Diagnosis </p>
            <p> Based in part on Weygoldt (2006b) , this species may be separated from other species
                  of <tp:taxon-name> Charinus </tp:taxon-name> in Oceania by the following
                  combination of characters: median and lateral eyes reduced ( Fig. 99A, C ); </p>
            <p> long, slender legs. It differs from <tp:taxon-name> C. cavernicolus </tp:taxon-name>
                  by the long legs and slender appearance, and from <tp:taxon-name> C. pecki
                  </tp:taxon-name> by the long distal spine on the pedipalp tarsus. </p>

      <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="etymology">
            <p> Etymology </p>
            <p> The species name refers to the long, thin walking legs ( Weygoldt 2006 ). </p>

            <p> Supplementary description </p>
            <p> CARAPACE. Median eyes and median ocular tubercle reduced ( Fig. 99A, C ); pair of
                  setae on median ocular tubercle; lateral eyes weakly developed, pale, with seta
                  posterior to lateral ocular triad ( Fig. 99A ); lateral ocular triad well
                  separated from carapace margin. </p>
            <p> STERNUM. Tritosternum projected anteriorly with typical setation ( Fig. 99B ); other
                  sternal platelets wide, with seta on each lateral border and some smaller setae in
                  between; pentasternum with six setae anteriorly and one seta in membranous region. </p>
            <p>OPISTHOSOMA. Ventral sacs and ventral sac cover absent.</p>
            <p> GENITALIA. Posterior margin of female genital operculum slightly convex; gonopod
                  cushion-like (see Weygoldt 2006b : figs 5–6), unsclerotized basally. Male unknown. </p>
            <p> CHELICERAE. Small, flat tooth on retrolateral surface of basal segment, opposite to
                  bifid tooth ( Fig. 11F ); retrolateral surface of claw with row of setae
                  restricted to base; claw with five teeth ( Fig. 11E–F ); row of ten setae on
                  prolateral surface of basal segment; bifid tooth on basal segment with dorsal cusp
                  larger than ventral cusp ( Fig. 11E–F ). </p>
            <p> PEDIPALPS. Coxal dorsal carina without setae encircled by round carina and with four
                  setae on margin. Femur with four dorsal spines, last spine very small, and three
                  ventral spines ( holotype with extra spine distally on dextral pedipalp) ( Fig.
                  99E–F ); three prominent setiferous tubercles between dorsal spine 1 and proximal
                  margin. Patella with three dorsal spines and prominent setiferous tubercle
                  proximal to spine 3 ( Fig. 99E ); prominent setiferous tubercle distal to spine I,
                  one-third length of spine I; two ventral spines ( Fig. 99F ); two setiferous
                  tubercles between spine I and distal margin. Tibia with ventral spine distally and
                  three setae between spine and distal margin; several long, slender setae
                  prolateral to ventral spines. Tarsus with two dorsal spines, distal spine long,
                  half length of tarsus, and proximal spine onethird length of distal spine ( Fig.
                  99D ); several long, narrow setae ventral to distal spine; cleaning organ with
                  32–35 setae in ventral row. </p>
            <p> LEGS. Tibia of leg I with 23 articles; tarsus I with 41 articles; first tarsal
                  article subequal in length to subsequent articles (length of first article: 0.7 mm
                  ; length of second article: 0.64 mm , n= 1). Leg IV basitibia with four
                  pseudo-articles, trichobothrium bt situated in proximal third of pseudo-article;
                  distitibia trichobothrium bc situated closer to sbf than to bf , sc and sf series
                  with five trichobothria. </p>
