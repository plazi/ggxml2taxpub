</p>
      <p>

Cymes scorpioid of 6–14 flowers in two rows, terminal, unbranched; peduncles angular, 10–16 × 
0.15–0.2 cm

1–2 mm
, longer in fruit, claret coloured, densely glandular-pubescent. Hypanthium campanulate, 5–6 × 
2–3 mm
, 3-lobed, 3-ribbed, claret coloured with greenish tinge distally, densely glandular-pubescent; lobes triangular, 1–2 × 
1–2 mm
, acute at apex. Petals 3, ovate to elliptic, 7–8 × 
4–5 mm
, pale pink with darker midrib, obtuse to rounded at base, acute to mucronate at apex, glabrous adaxially, with glandular trichomes on midrib abaxially. Stamens 3, alternate to petals; filaments 
4–5 mm
long, pale pink, glabrous, dilated and twisted downwards; anthers sagittate to deeply cordate at base, acute at apex, 
4–5 mm
long, yellow, dehiscing through apical pores. Ovary inferior, 2–2.5 × 
2–3 mm
; style filiform, 
8–9 mm
long, pale pink, dark towards apex, longer than stamen; stigma capitate, pink, rugose, glabrous. Capsules urceolate, 5–9 × 
3–3.5 mm
, claret coloured or green with claret tinge, 3-ribbed, with sparse bristly trichomes. Seeds many, obovoid, 
0.5–0.6 mm
long, pale brown; raphe prominent, excurrent; testa densely tuberculate throughout.

Distribution and habitat
</p>
      <p>
The new taxon is presently known only from a small area in the Kattukunnu of Banasura hills within the South Wayanad forest division (
Fig. 1
), where it has been growing under wet rocks on grassy slopes at an elevation of ca 
1000 m
. Although no detailed ecological studies have been undertaken, 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. longipedunculata
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
appears to be restricted to shaded rocky outcrops and is likely to occur in areas where a specific combination of light intensity and moisture prevails, such as vertical, mosscovered rocks or rock crevices, as is the case for many species of 

<tp:taxon-name>Sonerila</tp:taxon-name>
.

It is found in association with 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. raghaviana
Ratheesh, Sunil, Nandakumar &amp; Shaju
</tp:taxon-name>
, species of grass (
<tp:taxon-name>Poaceae Barnhart</tp:taxon-name>

         <tp:taxon-name>
Sonerila longipedunculata

sp. nov.
is known from a single population in the 
type
locality with about 60 mature individuals. The Area of Occupancy (AOO) is less than 
10 km
2
. No anthropogenic threat was detected as the area falls under a protected forest. However, this area is prone to landslides due to heavy rain, which has occurred in previous years. The habitat has been affected by climate-induced draught after the unexpected floods in 2018 and 2019. We suggest the status of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. longipedunculata
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
as Critically Endangered (CR) B1ab(ii) + B2ab(ii) according to 
IUCN (2019)
criteria.

Notes
</p>
      <p>
The new species is remarkable by the presence of a tuberous root stock (
Fig. 2
C–E), a feature seen in some of the South Indian caulescent species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sonerila
</tp:taxon-name>
that is apparently absent in Sri Lankan species (
Lundin 1983
), but also reported in species from the Malay Peninsula, 
Vietnam
and 
Cambodia
(
Ridley 1912
; 
Pham 2003
; 

Cho 
et al.
2015

; 

Van Dang 
et al.
2016

). These tubers, with the arrival of the monsoon, produce new stem and tufts of roots. The species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sonerila
</tp:taxon-name>
from 
India
are mostly pedunculate (with terete or angular peduncles) and rarely sub-sessile. The longer peduncles (
10–16 cm
) and petioles (
5–9 cm
) further distinguish the new species, and these traits are not described in any other caulescent herbaceous species, other than the suffrutescent or woody species of Indian 

<tp:taxon-name>Sonerila</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>Sonerila longipedunculata</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
has fleshy and simple stems, which occasionally branch at distal nodes and become procumbent with roots arising from many points along the stem basally, when grown in the greenhouse.

</tp:taxon-name>

Narayanan 
et al.
