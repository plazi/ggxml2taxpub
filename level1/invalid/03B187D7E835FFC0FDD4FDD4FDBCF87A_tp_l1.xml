can be distinguished from all species of the genus by the combination of the following characters: 1) smaller size (CL: 
1.25–1.26 mm
); 2) tomentum on profemora reaching behind middle, on mesofemora to around middle (
Fig. 6F
); 3) humeri produced; 4) prominent carina on sixth interval present; 5) elytral punctures shallowly impressed; 6) apex of aedeagus subtriangular (

Description
</p>
      <p>
Male
</p>
      <p>
BODY. Obovate, black (
Fig. 3C
); length 
1.25–1.26 mm
; width 
0.58–0.64 mm
; dorsum conveX, glabrous with sparse, light yellowish-brown setae. Hairy or scale-like tomentum distributed on following areas: genae, sides of prosternum, mesoventrite, metaventrite and abdomen, epipleura, and medial and lateral portions on bases of femora.
</p>
      <p>COLOUR. Head, pronotum and elytra black; venter dark brown to black with reddish tinge; coxae, femora and tarsi dark brown with reddish tinge; trochanters and tibiae brown; basal segments of antennae and tarsal claws pale brown.</p>
      <p>
HEAD. Partly retractable into prothoraX, dorsally shiny. Antennae filiform, 11-segmented; pedicel about twice as long as scape; remaining segments about 4 times as long as scape and pedicel combined; segments 3–10 subrectangular, subequal in length; terminal segment longest, suboval, with pointed apex. Labrum with anterior margin almost straight; anterolateral angles broadly arcuate with numerous golden, recumbent hair-like setae; clypeus shorter and wider than labrum, about 3.5 times as wide as long, anterior margin slightly concave, anterolateral angles rounded; frontoclypeal suture almost straight. Eyes well developed, HW: 
0.26–0.28 mm
, ID: 
0.14–0.16 mm
, suboval in lateral view, protruding from head outline in dorsal view, circumocular surface raised. Frons between eyes convex.
</p>
      <p>
THORAX. Pronotum widest behind middle, PW: 
0.38–0.41 mm
, PL: 
0.47–0.49 mm
; surface shiny, with narrow reticulation along basal margin and posterolateral angles, with dense tiny punctures; sublateral carinae never well-developed, but a short, very fine raised sublateral line in basal ½ present; disc conveX, divided by a broad, deep transverse impression before middle; prescutellar foveae separated by a raised line extending from base to middle connecting pre- and postimpression portions and merging into them; anterior margin arcuate; posterior margin bisinuate; sides of pronotum convex before and after transverse constriction; lateral margins narrowly rimmed; posterolateral angles orthogonal; anterolateral angles slightly produced. Hypomeron finely microreticulate, widest in middle. Prosternum moderately long in front of procoxae, with anterior margin concave; sides raised around procoxae, forming carinae, not reaching anterior margin, prosternal process long, moderately broad, with posterior margin broadly rounded. Mesoventrite coarse, short and wide, with deep triangular groove for reception of prosternal process; posterior margin around mesocoxae raised. Metaventrite slightly wider than long, shiny with setigerous punctures; disc convex with very shallow to indistinct medial, triangular depression in posterior half; discrimen in basal ¾, very thin, indistinct; prebasal foveae absent. Elytra (EL: 
0.77–0.81 mm
, EW: 
0.58–0.64 mm
) conveX, widest in anterior ¾; sides strongly declivous; surface shiny, with dense tiny punctures; elytral margin narrowly rimmed; humeri protruding from outline; epipleuron tapering posteriorly. Prominent carina on siXth interval reaching ⅘ of elytron. Elytra with ten rows of small, shallowly impressed punctures, separated by a 2–4 times puncture diameter, diminishing toward lateral margins and elytral apeX or absent. Scutellum subovate, flat. Legs moderately long; femora clavate; tibiae longest. Protibiae with anterior cleaning fringe on apical ⅓; mesotibiae with two cleaning fringes – anterior on apical ⅕ and posterior on apical ⅓; metatibiae with posterior cleaning fringe on apical ⅓. Tarsi 5-segmented, first four segments each with one fine pale, recumbent seta, fifth segment slightly shorter than remaining segments combined; claws with a large subbasal and smaller basal teeth.
</p>
      <p>
ABDOMEN. With 5 ventrites. First ventrite with basal margin broadly rounded, fifth ventrite longest, apically setose with posterior margin broadly arcuate. Aedeagus (
Fig. 9
A–B) elongate. Penis without fibula; corona in apical half; in ventral view parallel-sided, apically eXtended, apeX subtriangular; in lateral view straight, ventrally narrowed from base to apeX. Parameres absent. Phallobase slightly longer than penis, parallel-sided, in ventral view straight, slightly curved in lateral view.
</p>
      <p>
Female
</p>
      <p>EXternally similar to male, eXcept fifth ventrite more elongate and eXtension of femoral tomentum slightly greater.</p>
