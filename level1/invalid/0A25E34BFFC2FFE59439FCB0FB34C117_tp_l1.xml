differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. serpentinus
</tp:taxon-name>
by having the head with one pair of interocular punctures, antennae with the last three antennomeres much lighter than the preceding segments (
Fig. 3A
) and the abdominal terga IV and V each without a distinct posterior basal transverse carina.

Etymology
</p>
      <p>
This new species is dedicated to the outstanding Peruvian coleopterist Angélico Asenjo, a great friend and colleague, in recognition of his tireless contribution to the study of 
<tp:taxon-name>Staphylinidae</tp:taxon-name>
from Latin America and other regions, and as a small gesture of thanks for his continuous support of and collaboration with the first author, MR. This specific epithet is regarded as a Latinized masculine noun in the genitive case.

sp. nov.
is only known at present from its type locality in Bambamarca, department of 
Cajamarca
, Northern 
Peru
at 
3000 m
[m a.s.l.] (
Fig. 4
). In addition, it is known that on the same collection day as that of the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. asenjoi
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
(i.e., 
28 Jun. 1956
), Weyrauch collected two specimens of 

Cajamarca
triseriata

Roewer, 1957
(Arachnida: Opiliones) in “Nord-Peru: Cerro Macheipungo, 
4 km
NW Bambamarca” (
Roewer 1957: 75
), which is georeferenced as 
06°41′ S
, 
78°32′ W
(
Breure 2012: 5
). Therefore, it is highly probable that this locality is the same or close to where the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. asenjoi
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
was collected. Bambamarca belongs to the ecoregion of Peruvian Yungas (

Olson 
et al.
2001

) or Puna province (
Morrone 2014
) and is nowadays agricultural land, surrounded by an urban zone and Andean shrubland ecosystem (
MINAM 2019
).
