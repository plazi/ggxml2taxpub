Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>The new species is similar to other congeneric species in appearance, but it can easily be distinguished by the dorsal sclerite of the male genitalia being shaped like a butterfly with open wings, the basal area of the dorso-median lobe forming a protuberance, and the hind tibia being provided with 104 inner spines and 114 outer spines on the dorsal surface.</p>

Etymology
</p>
      <p>
The name of the new species derives from the Latin word ‘ 
papilio
’ (‘butterfly’), referring to the dorsal sclerite of the male genitalia being shaped like a butterfly with open wings.

      <p>
Male
</p>
      <p>BODY. Medium-sized.</p>
      <p>HEAD. Fastigium verticis with two conical tubercles, apices obtusely rounded, pointing forward. Eyes oval, protruding forward; median ocellus oval, located between antennal sockets; lateral ocelli nearly</p>
      <p>circular, situated on lateral margin of basal area of fastigium verticis. Apical segment of maxillary palpus distinctly longer than subapical one, apex inflated, globular.</p>
      <p>THORAX. Pronotum long, anterior margin straight, posterior margin arcuate; lateral lobes longer than high, ventral margin arc-shaped. Mesonotum and metanotum short, posterior margin of mesonotum arcuate, posterior margin of metanotum straight.</p>
      <p>LEGS. Fore coxa with one small spine; femur unarmed on ventral surface, internal genicular lobe with one small spine, external genicular lobe with one long spine; tibia with one inner spine and two outer spines on ventral surface, apex with one outer spine on dorsal surface and one pair of ventral spines, between paired ventral spines with one small spine. Mid femur unarmed on ventral surface, internal and external genicular lobes with one long spine each; tibia with one inner spine and one outer spine on ventral surface, apex with one pair of dorsal spines and one pair of ventral spines, between paired ventral spines with one small spine. Hind femur unarmed on ventral surface, internal genicular lobe with one spine, external genicular lobe unarmed; tibia with 104 inner spines and 114 outer spines on dorsal surface, with one pair of dorsal spines in subapical area, and at apex with one pair of dorsal spines and two pairs of ventral spines, interno-dorsal spine markedly shorter than hind basitarsus. Hind basitarsus with one apical spine on dorsal surface, ventral surface without bristles.</p>
      <p>MALE ABDOMEN. Posterior margins of all abdominal tergites relatively straight, abdominal sterna with distinct conical tubercles. Epiproct semicircular, paraproct simple, nearly triangular in lateral view. Cercus extremely long, conical, apex acute. Genitalia with six membranous lobes, basal area of dorsomedian lobe forming a protuberance, apical area with one pair of small lobes, lateral sclerite narrow, crescent shaped, dorso-lateral lobes slightly longer than dorso-median lobe, ventro-lateral lobes shorter</p>
