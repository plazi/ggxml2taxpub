Etymology
</p>
      <p>
The new species is named to honour the memory of Marilyn Suzanne Amos, of Mobile, 
Alabama
, 
USA
, who passed away during these studies. She was the mother of the second author (EJ). The specific epithet is used as a Latin noun in apposition. The vernacular name is Amos’s crab.

Potamonautes amosae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
was collected from rocky areas of Lake Kivu in the D.R. Congo and 
Rwanda
(
Fig. 3
). Lake Kivu is a relatively small (
100 km
long by 
50 km
wide), deep lake (depth 
480 m
) situated in the Albertine Rift of the Western Rift Valley. This lake is divided by the border between the D.R. Congo and 
Rwanda
, with the large Idjwi Island lying in the D.R. Congo. The Ruzizi River drains south out of Lake Kivu and links it to the northern part of Lake Tanganyika in 
Burundi
, but this species has not been recorded from this river. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Potamonautes amosae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
is found along the eastern shores of Lake Tanganyika in localities associated with the Malagarasi River in western 
Tanzania
(
Capart 1952
; 
Reed &amp; Cumberlidge 2006
; M. Mbalassa &amp; S. Marijnissen pers. com.) where it flows through the 
Kigoma District
, and on the western shores of Lake Tanganyika at Kalemie in the D.R. Congo (
Capart 1952

Little is known about the habitat and ecology of

sp. nov.
In the region of Lake Tanganyika this species was often captured in marshes and wetlands near the lake, but never in the lake itself (
Capart 1952
). In Lake 
Kivu
this species is found on islands in the lake as well as in the lake (
Chace 1942

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
There are a number of characters that distinguish 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amosae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. orbitospinus
</tp:taxon-name>
in Lake 
Malawi
. For example, the male thoracic sternal sulcus S3/4 of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amosae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
is faint and shallow (vs deep and complete in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. orbitospinus
</tp:taxon-name>
); the low dorsal lobe of the G1 TA of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amosae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
means that it is only slightly widened (vs a G1 TA dorsal margin that is conspicuously widened by a high dorsal lobe in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. orbitospinus
</tp:taxon-name>
); the anterolateral margin of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amosae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
is lined by small granules (vs lined by a row of small distinct teeth in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. orbitospinus
</tp:taxon-name>
); the merus, propodus, and dactylus of P5 of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amosae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
are all short (vs all elongated and slender in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. orbitospinus
</tp:taxon-name>
); and the third maxilliped ischium of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amosae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
is smooth (vs with a third maxilliped ischium that has a deep vertical sulcus in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. orbitospinus

).
</p>
      <p>
In the past, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amosae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
from Lake Kivu has been identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. lirrangensis
</tp:taxon-name>
s. lat.
by a number of authors (
Chace 1942
; 
Bott 1955
; 
Reed &amp; Cumberlidge 2006
; 
Cumberlidge &amp; Meyer 2011
). These identifications were made based on characters shared with the 
type
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. lirrangensis
</tp:taxon-name>
s. str.
from Liranga (such as denticles or granules lining the anterolateral margin, 2 large pointed spines on the cheliped carpus inner margin, and a large pointed spine on the cheliped merus inner margin). There are a number of illustrations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amosae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
available, but most of these specimens have been identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. lirrangensis
</tp:taxon-name>
s. lat.
For example, 
Chace (1942)
illustrated the carapace and G1 of a specimen from Lake Kivu (MCZ CRU-11224), and 
Capart (1952
: fig. 12) figured an entire specimen from Kalemie (formerly Albertville) on the western shores of Lake Tanganyika and remarked on its similarity to the species found in Lake Kivu. Later, 
Reed &amp; Cumberlidge (2006
: figs 41–51, 153–154, 177 pl. V) described in detail an adult female (CW 
81 mm
) and male (CW 
56.5 mm
) of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. lirrangensis
</tp:taxon-name>
s. lat.
(NMU TRW1971.15) from the Malagarasi River at Uvinza in the

</tp:taxon-name>
s. lat.
from Ruzizi in Lake Kivu in the D.R. Congo (GenBank

Malawi
(GenBank

Marijnissen

) formed a separate basal lineage from the clade formed by the other 
2 specimens
from Lake

</p>
      <p>
Daniels et al. (2015)
sequenced four DNA markers (GenBank

<tp:taxon-name>
P. lirrangensis
</tp:taxon-name>
s. lat.
and incorrectly listed as being from Lake 
Malawi
. In fact, specimen ZMA.Crust. De.204681 was collected from Lake Kivu (site 13, E. major; 
23 Aug. 2002
; Pascal Isumbisa leg.) and is therefore properly identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amosae
</tp:taxon-name>

      <p>
There is molecular support for the recognition of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amosae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
as a valid species from mitochondrial 16S rRNA and the nuclear coding gene Histone H3 sequences (
Fig. 14

5 specimens
are assigned to
