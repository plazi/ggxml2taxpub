Etymology
</p>
      <p>
Name derived from a combination of ‘ 
maculis
’ (Latin for ‘spotted’) and ‘ 
pennis
’ (Latin for ‘plumage’) because of the spotted colouration of the fore wing.

Nervulus (cu-a) short, distinct, strongly postfurcal, distance between basal vein (1-M) and nervulus (cu-a) 1.5–1.8 times nervulus length. Mediocubital vein (M+CU1) rather evenly and distinctly curved to longitudinal anal vein (1-1A). Narrow brachial (subdiscal) cell closed apically distinctly before recurrent vein (m-cu), apically reclivous and straight. Parallel vein (CU1a) interstitial. Hind wing 4.8–5.3 times longer than its maximum width. First costal abscissa (C+SC+R) 0.7–1.0 times as long as second abscissa (1-SC+R).
