      <p>
By far the most species-rich family of 
<tp:taxon-name>Chordeumatida</tp:taxon-name>
in Europe, and also with a particularly complicated taxonomy. Although much work has been done on some genera, several others are badly in need of revision, and several nominal species, of which only some have been included here, remain doubtful. The vast majority of the 189 species occur in 
Italy
, especially N 
Italy
, and adjoining countries, but several species occur further west, north and east. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Craspedosoma raulinsii
Leach, 1814
</tp:taxon-name>
is the most widespread European species of the order, extending from 
France
and the British Isles into southern Scandinavia, C and E Europe, with a few outliers (introductions?) in C 
Sweden
and 
Russia
.
