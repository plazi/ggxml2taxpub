      <p> By far the most species-rich family of <tp:taxon-name>Chordeumatida</tp:taxon-name> in
         Europe, and also with a particularly complicated taxonomy. Although much work has been done
         on some genera, several others are badly in need of revision, and several nominal species,
         of which only some have been included here, remain doubtful. The vast majority of the 189
         species occur in Italy , especially N Italy , and adjoining countries, but several species
         occur further west, north and east. <tp:taxon-name> Craspedosoma raulinsii Leach, 1814
         </tp:taxon-name> is the most widespread European species of the order, extending from
         France and the British Isles into southern Scandinavia, C and E Europe, with a few outliers
         (introductions?) in C Sweden and Russia . </p>
