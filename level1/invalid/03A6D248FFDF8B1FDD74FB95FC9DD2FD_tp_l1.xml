Notes on 
type
material

<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium luteum
</tp:taxon-name>
. The 
lectotype
was selected because the male parts are present (although they were previously detached from the specimen). The posterior part of the 
lectotype
is missing and the digestive system is not well preserved. The three 
paralectotypes
were also previously dissected: the internal organs are missing in the two largest ones; the third and smallest 
paralectotype
was cut longitudinally
</p>
      <p>
in two halves and is largely destroyed. Semper listed five 
syntypes
, suggesting that one of the original 
syntypes
is missing.
</p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Oncis schneideri
</tp:taxon-name>
. The 
holotype
was previously dissected. The penial complex was drawn by Hoffmann and likely destroyed by him (it is missing), and the insertion of the retractor muscle cannot be checked. Some parts of the female (posterior) reproductive system are inside the 
holotype
, but are largely destroyed. The digestive system is largely destroyed; the radula is present but the intestine is missing and the intestinal type cannot be verified.

) The dorsal notum of live animals may be covered by dry mud (especially when found underneath logs and rocks). The notum is bumpy with prominent, distinctly-raised papillae (with or without dorsal eyes). Individuals are flattened but often become almost hemispherical when disturbed. The dorsal color is typically brown, dark brown or nearly black, and occasionally yellowish-brown. The hyponotum color varies greatly: it may be dark blue, medium grey, white or variants in between. Papillae with dorsal eyes are present, many of which are distinctly raised. The exact number of papillae bearing dorsal eyes is difficult to determine as papillae may be retracted, but is usually between 10 and 22, although up to 35 dorsal eyes have been observed. Papillae bear only one dorsal eye. Dorsal eyes may be distributed across the entire notum or only in the middle but are absent from the margin (eyes are never &lt;
2 mm
from the notum edge).

Radulae measure up to

Reproductive system
(
Figs 33F
,

</p>
      <p>
In the posterior part of the reproductive system, the oviduct is approximately twice as wide as the deferent duct. Its distal section (distal to the spermatheca) is shorter or equal to its proximal section. The deferent duct is not attached or only loosely attached to the oviduct, and generally loosely coiled (not with many tight, U-shaped loops), but individuals with a highly-coiled deferent duct exceptionally do exist. The position of the female pore varies from very close to the anus (&lt;
1 mm
) up to 
3 mm
away from the anus. The flexible region of the penis with hooks is approximately 
1 to 1.5 mm
long. Penial hooks are large, approximately 
45 to 90 µm
long, but between 
20 to 60 µm
long in smaller individuals from 
Mauritius
. The penial hooks can be seen inside the semi-transparent penis. The posterior retractor muscle inserts near the heart on the right side of the visceral cavity. Its length varies from being half the length of the penial sheath to three times as long. The deferent duct is not particularly long or convoluted, displaying only a few loose loops (it is even less convoluted in immature specimens).

</p>
      <p>
The yellow foot of 
<tp:taxon-name>

easily distinguishes it from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
(black foot) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. aptei
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
(orange foot). However, its hyponotum color is highly variable and does not help distinguish it from other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
with a blue or grey hyponotum (e.g., 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. burnupi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
). Live individuals can be more hemispherical (especially when contracted) than in other species, but flattened individuals can easily be mistaken for small individuals of other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
reaches a smaller maximum size than other species with a similar ventral color, but the size range of all these species overlaps and cannot be used for identification. Finally, the notum of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
bears prominent dorsal papillae, which are especially obvious when the animal is contracted, but these dorsal papillae are also present in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
and are thus not strictly diagnostic of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
. The notum of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. burnupi
</tp:taxon-name>
is granular (i.e., not smooth), but does not bear prominent papillae, whether animals are disturbed or not.

Internally, intestinal loops help to distinguish 
<tp:taxon-name>

from 
<tp:taxon-name>

, 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. latus

(
Table 4
). The latter two species share intestinal loops of 
type
III, while the intestine of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
is of 
type
I or II. Further, even though the intestinal loops of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
are also of 
type
I, their transitional loop is oriented between 1 and 2 o’clock, while the transitional loop of individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
with a 
type
I is oriented between 3 and 6 o’clock. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
slugs with similar intestinal loops of 
type
II can be distinguished by other means, especially the length of the region of the penis with penial hooks: 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
(approximately 
1 mm
), 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
2–8 mm
), 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi

(
2–2.5 mm
) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. aptei
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
(
2.5–5 mm
). Note that 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amboinae
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. latus
</tp:taxon-name>
, which both completely lack penial hooks, also differ from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
in that respect. In the posterior reproductive system, the deferent duct is short, usually loosely coiled and only loosely attached to the oviduct, which helps to differentiate 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
, in which the deferent duct is tightly coiled and attached to the oviduct. The insertion of the retractor muscle of the penis near the heart in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
also clearly distinguishes it from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. aptei
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
, in which it inserts at the posterior end of the visceral cavity.
</p>
      <p>
Finally, individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
with intestinal loops of 
type
I can also be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. burnupi
</tp:taxon-name>
(intestinal loops of 
type
II) but individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
with intestinal loops of 
type
II cannot. However, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. burnupi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
do not overlap geographically, and can be reliably distinguished using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences.

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
The publication dates of the different sections of Semper’s 
Landmollusken
in the 

Reisen im Archipel der 
Philippinen

series were clarified by 
Johnson (1969)
. Because 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium luteum
</tp:taxon-name>
was published before 1931, ICZN Article 12.2.7 applies: 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium luteum
</tp:taxon-name>
was made available in 1880 because Semper’s figures (pl. 20, fig. 10, pl. 23, figs 2, 6) are regarded as an indication accompanying it, although the text of the description was not published until 1882.
</p>
      <p>
The species treated here is common and broadly distributed in the Indo-West Pacific, and so many original descriptions had to be reviewed and many type specimens examined in order to determine which existing names apply to it. The 
lectotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium luteum
</tp:taxon-name>
displays all the distinctive characteristics of a species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
: flattened shape, narrow foot and no accessory penial gland. Also, its male opening is slightly to the right of the midline between the oral tentacles, which agrees with Semper’s (1882: 275) description and is perfectly compatible with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
. Two main features indicate that the 
lectotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. luteum
</tp:taxon-name>
belongs to the species described here: the dorsal papillae on its notum as well as its penial anatomy, which is identical to what was observed in fresh material (
Fig. 31C
). Based on their dorsal notum (which also bears dorsal papillae) and Semper’s description (1882: 275) of the internal anatomy, it is very likely that the 
paralectotypes
also are part of the species described here. In particular, Semper described a short penis with a distal, flexible, hook-bearing region scarcely 
1 mm
long and a retractor muscle that inserts by the heart. Semper also described 16–25 dorsal eyes and noted that the dorsal eyes never reach the edge of the dorsal notum, which is in agreement with our observations and with all species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
in clade C (see 
Fig. 4
).
</p>
      <p>
Semper (1882) did not mention or illustrate the type of intestinal loops in the original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium luteum
</tp:taxon-name>
, and it could not be checked for the present study because the intestine of the 
lectotype
is not well preserved (and that of the 
paralectotypes
could not be checked either). However, 
Plate (1893: 181)
examined two of the former 
syntypes
and indicated that intestinal loops are of type II, which is compatible with our observations on freshly-collected samples from 
Singapore
.
</p>
      <p>
The intraspecific variation in the 
type
of intestinal loops observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
type
I, 
type
II and intermediary between 
types
I and II) is very unusual. Nearly all onchidiid species are characterized by only one 
type
of intestinal loops. Another known exception is 
<tp:taxon-name>
Alionchis jailoloensis
</tp:taxon-name>
characterized by intestinal loops of both 
types
II and III (

Goulding 
et al
. 2018a

; 

Dayrat 
et al
. 2019c

). The dissection of individuals for which the species identification was confirmed through DNA sequences allowed us to determine that intestinal 
types
vary between individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
even at the exact same localities.
</p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex schneideri
</tp:taxon-name>
was described by 
Hoffmann (1932: 135–137)
, as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis schneideri
</tp:taxon-name>
, from 
New Britain
, 
Papua New Guinea
, as a flat animal with a rectal gland, no accessory penial gland and a male pore to the left of the right eye tentacle. Combined, these features indicate that Hoffmann was correct in describing the species in Plate’s genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
</tp:taxon-name>
(now 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
). 
Hoffmann (1932: 135)
also described strong dorsal papillae (which he called ‘Tuberkeln’, or tubercles), a characteristic of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
. The male parts of the 
holotype
, now missing, were described and illustrated by 
Hoffmann (1932: 136)
, and the insertion of the retractor muscle at the level of the pericardium is compatible with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
. The intestinal loops were described as of type II, which is compatible with the variation observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
, but not with the sympatric species 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(in which intestinal loops are only of type I). For all the reasons above, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex schneideri
</tp:taxon-name>
is regarded as a junior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
.

Hoffmann (1932: 136)
suggested that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex schneideri
</tp:taxon-name>
might be a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amboinae
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granulosa
</tp:taxon-name>
(all as species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
</tp:taxon-name>
), but 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granulosa
</tp:taxon-name>
is a nomen dubium (see our species remarks on 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. latus
</tp:taxon-name>
). However, since 
Hoffmann (1928: 36)
considered 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex latus
</tp:taxon-name>
a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. granulosa
</tp:taxon-name>
, we can consider his comments on 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. schneideri
(
Hoffmann 1932: 136
)
</tp:taxon-name>
refer, in his mind, to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amboinae
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. latus
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Hoffmann’s (1932: 136)
description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. schneideri
</tp:taxon-name>
includes penial hooks, which are not found in either 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amboinae
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. latus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Table 4
). Hoffmann did not describe the dorsal eyes on the back of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. schneideri
</tp:taxon-name>
, but there are at least 18 eyes (one eye per papilla) on the dorsal notum of the 
holotype
. The presence of dorsal eyes also precludes 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. schneideri
</tp:taxon-name>
from being a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amboinae
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. latus
</tp:taxon-name>
, which both lack dorsal eyes (
Table 4
).
</p>
      <p>
Hoffmann (1932: 135)
noted a similarity between 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex schneideri
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. semperi
(
Plate, 1893
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, but concluded that they could not refer to the same species because their intestinal loops differed (type II in the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. schneideri
</tp:taxon-name>
and type I in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. semperi
</tp:taxon-name>
according to Plate’s original description). However, as mentioned above, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
is an exception regarding intestinal loops, and both 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. schneideri
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. semperi
</tp:taxon-name>
are compatible with the intraspecific variation in intestinal loops within 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
      <p>
Plate’s (1893)
description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis semperi
</tp:taxon-name>
, based on two 
syntypes
(22/18 and 22/ 
18 mm
) from Mindanao (ZMB/Moll 45661), is only compatible with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex semperi
</tp:taxon-name>
is thus regarded as a junior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
. The description of intestinal loops of type I suggests that one of the two 
syntypes
could belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
instead of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
, but this is most likely simply a mistake (see our remarks on 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
).
</p>
      <p>
Britton (1984)
described 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Hong Kong
based on four specimens with different intestinal types: two specimens (including the 
holotype
) with intestinal loops of type I, one with intestinal loops of type II and one with intestinal loops of an intermediate type between types I and II. Only the latter could be checked here because the digestive system is missing in all other types (see our remarks on 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
for a detailed description of the type material of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
). If Britton was correct that the intestinal loops of the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
were of type I, then 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
would be incompatible with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
(which are all characterized by a digestive system of type II), and the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
could be part of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
. However, it is unclear whether Britton’s description of the intestinal loops of the 
holotype
is correct (see our remarks on 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
for additional discussion of the status of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
). Also, 
<tp:taxon-name>

is not represented in the genetic sequences published by 

Sun

or other sequences available in GenBank from

</tp:taxon-name>
is later found in 
Hong Kong
, then the name 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
could be discussed as a possible synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
. For now, however, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
is regarded as a nomen dubium.

Von 
Martens (1897: 127)
indicated that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium luteum
</tp:taxon-name>
was found in “ 
Celebes
Djenemaedja bei Luwu” [Djenemaedja by Luwu, 
Sulawesi
, 
Indonesia
] by M. Weber, but did not provide any details with respect to identification. 
Hoffmann (1928: 89–90)
noted that it was impossible to determine whether the specimens von Martens examined from 
Sulawesi
were 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. luteum
</tp:taxon-name>
, since only the external appearance was described.

      <p>
In a study focusing on the relative abundance of onchidiids across a Malaysian mangrove forest, 
Sabri &amp; Singh (2018)
mentioned 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Selangor
, western Peninsular 
Malaysia
. Based on the small picture provided and the absence of any additional details regarding ventral coloration, anatomy or DNA sequences, it is unclear whether this identification is correct. We did not find 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
at any of the localities we visited in western Peninsular 
Malaysia
. Thus, the presence of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Selangor
is regarded here as hypothetical.

      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
is not a new combination because it was already used in our recent studies (

Goulding

), even though the classification in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
is demonstrated here for the first time. Note that 
Stantschinsky (1907: 395)
and 
Hoffmann (1928: 89)
had already moved 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
to Plate’s genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
</tp:taxon-name>
, based on information from the original description (Semper 1882).
