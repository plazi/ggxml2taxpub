Upper margin of clypeus situated upper lower level of eyes. Hypoclypeal depression small and round, its width 0.6–0.7 times distance from edge of depression to eye, 0.3 times width of face. Occipital carina not fused ventrally with hypostomal carina being obliterated upper base of mandible. Vertex weakly convex. Head below eyes distinctly and weakly-roundly narrowed. Antennae slender, weakly setiform, 25-segmented, 1.4 times as long as body. Scapus 1.4 times as long as its maximum width. First flagellar segment 4.5 times as long as its apical width, 1.1 times as long as second segment. Penultimate segment 4.7 times as long as wide, 0.8 times as long as first flagellar segment and 0.9 times as long as apical segment; the latter acuminate apically.</p>
      <p>MESOSOMA. Length 2.1 times its height. Pronotal carina distinct, distances from carina to anterior margin of pronotum subequal to distance from carina to posterior margin. Mesoscutum weakly, not highly and gently-roundly elevated above pronotum (lateral view), 0.8 times as long as maximum width (dorsal view). Notauli deep anteriorly and shallow in posterior 0.4, rather wide, finely crenulate with granulation. Median lobe of mesoscutum with shallow median furrow. Prescutellar depression rather shallow, rather long, distinctly and roundly widened postero-laterally, with high median carina, entirely rugulose, 0.6 times as long as weakly convex and transverse scutellum. Sternaulus (precoxal furrow) rather narrow, almost entirely smooth, running along almost entire length of lower part of mesopleuron. Prepectal carina below without widened lobes opposite fore coxae. Subalar depression shallow, rather narrow, finely transverse striate and partly with reticulation. Metanotum with very short and rounded dorsomedial tooth (lateral view). Metapleural lobe relatively long, wide, subrounded apically, without dense pubescence.</p>

      <p>WINGS. Fore wing 3.6 times its maximum width. Metacarpus (1-R1) 1.4 times as long as pterostigma. First radial abscissa (r) forming distinctly obtuse angle with second abscissa (3-SR). Second radial abscissa (3-SR) 2.5 times as long as first abscissa (r), 0.4 times as long as the straight third abscissa (SR1), 1.4 times as long as first radiomedial vein (2-SR). Second radiomedial (submarginal) cell medium-sized, not widened distally, 3.0 times as long as wide, 1.8 times as long as brachial (subdiscal) cell. First medial abscissa (1-SR+M) distinctly sinuate. Discoidal (discal) cell 2.2 times as long as maximum width. Mediocubital vein (M+CU1) very weakly curved to anal vein (2-1A) in distal half. Distance between nervulus (cu-a) and basal (1-M) vein 0.7 times nervulus (cu-a) length. Brachial (subdiscal) cell relatively narrow, gently-roundly closed rather distinctly before level of recurrent vein (m-cu); posterior bulla absent, posterior abscissa of longitudinal anal vein shortly developed. Hind wing 5.2 times as long as wide. First costal abscissa (C+SC+R) 0.5 times as long as second abscissa (1-SC+R). First abscissa of mediocubital vein (M+CU) 0.5 times as long as second abscissa (1-M). Recurrent vein (m-cu) unsclerotised, antefurcal, strongly curved towards base of wing.</p>
      <p>LEGS. Hind femur with very low and wide dorsal protuberance, length of femur 2.9 times its maximum width. Hind tarsus almost as long as hind tibia. Hind basitarsus 0.6 times length of second–fifth segments combined. Second tarsal segment 0.6 times as long as basitarsus, 1.3 times as long as fifth segment (without pretarsus).</p>
