      <p> Diagnosis </p>
      <p>Cp elongated and bean-shaped, with curved ventral margin. LV largely overlapping RV,
         especially along the anterior side. LV with weak anterior and ventral inner list, posterior
         inner list fully absent. RV without anterior inner list, posteriorly with weakly inwardly
         displaced selvage. Several limbs with segments reduced in length and/or in chaetotaxy: A1
         with four distal segments highly reduced in both length and chaetotaxy; A2 with one short
         natatory seta (or its accompanying seta) only and reduced length of two distal segments.
         Idem for Md-palp, Mx1, T1 and T2 (where both setae d1 and d2 are missing). Male
         unknown.</p>

      <p> Remarks </p>
      <p> Because of the structural reduction in both valves (inner lists mostly absent) and the
         limbs (especially in the A1, but also in most other limbs) it is clear that this new genus
         and its species do not belong in the tribe <tp:taxon-name>Cypridopsini</tp:taxon-name> and
         require a new tribe, which might in time even be elevated to the rank of subfamily. </p>
