Notes on 
type
material

</p>
      <p>
The designation of a 
neotype
is needed in order to clarify the application of the name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
(
ICZN
Article 75.3.1). The characters that differentiate 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
from other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
are mentioned below in a section on ‘Distinctive diagnostic features’ (
ICZN
Article 75.3.2). The 
neotype
is preserved separately and will be easily recognized (
ICZN
Article 75.3.3). The 
syntypes
could not be located after an exhaustive search of museum collections (
Dayrat 2009
) (
ICZN
Article 75.3.4). What is known of the former 
syntypes
, from the original description and illustrations, is consistent with the 
neotype
(
ICZN
Article 75.3.5). The type locality is the banks of the Mutlah River at Port Canning [Matla River, Ganges Delta, 
India
] and the 
neotype
was collected as nearly as practicable from the original type locality in 
West Bengal
(
ICZN
Article 75.3.6), and it is already the property of a scientific institution, the 
Bombay
Natural History Society, in 
Mumbai
, 
India
(
ICZN
Article 75.3.7). The 
neotype
was collected on soft mud by the sea with a few mangrove trees and dead logs. The designation of a 
neotype
is exceptionally needed in order to make sure that the application of the name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
remains unambiguous (see Remarks below).

Description
</p>
      <p>
Color and morphology of live animals
(
Fig. 26
)
</p>
      <p>
The dorsal surface is bumpy, not smooth, and typically brown with dark brown or yellow-brown markings. The hyponotum color varies from bluish grey to light grey. The edge of the hyponotum may be slightly lighter, but there is no prominent light-colored line around the entire edge. The foot color varies from dark blue-grey to light yellow. The number of papillae with dorsal eyes is variable (generally between 25 and 50). Dorsal eyes are distributed across the notum but are absent from its margin (i.e., eyes are never &lt;
2 mm
from the notum edge).
</p>
      <p>
Digestive system
(
Figs 27A
, 
28
)
</p>
      <p>
Radulae measure up to 
5 mm
in length. Examples of radular formulae are presented in 
Table 5
. The intestinal loops are of 
type
II, with transitional loops oriented between 6 and 9 o’clock (
Fig. 27A
).
</p>
      <p>
Reproductive system
(
Figs 27
B–C, 29)
</p>
      <p>
The oviduct is much wider than the deferent duct (approximately up to three times). Its distal section (distal to the spermatheca) is up to three times as long as its proximal section (
Fig. 27B
). The deferent duct is closely attached to the oviduct and almost straight (with only loose turns). The distal, flexible, hook-bearing section of the penis is 
1 to 1.5 mm
long. The penial hooks are approximately 
60 to 100 µm
long, and can be seen inside the semi-transparent penis. In mature specimens, the retractor muscle inserts on the right side of the visceral cavity near the heart. The retractor muscle is from one quarter as long as the penial sheath to equal to it in length (
Fig 27C
). The deferent duct is not highly convoluted, with only a few loops (and is even less convoluted in immature specimens).
</p>
      <p>
Distinctive diagnostic features
(
Table 4
)
</p>
      <p>
Externally, the yellow foot of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
clearly distinguishes it from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
(orange foot) and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. aptei
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
(black foot). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
is very similar externally to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amboinae
</tp:taxon-name>
, except that the notum of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
bears many dorsal eyes which are absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. amboinae
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
can be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. latus
</tp:taxon-name>
by its granular dorsal surface and the lack of large, thorny dorsal papillae. Its granular dorsal surface also helps to distinguish it from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, which bear prominent dorsal papillae when disturbed, although it is still possible to confuse these three species. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
cannot be distinguished externally from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
, which has been found in many of the same sites, except in 
India
(where 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
has not been found so far).
</p>
      <p>
Internally, the intestinal loops clearly distinguish 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
type
II) from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(
type
I). Some individuals of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
are characterized by intestinal loops of 
type
II and cannot be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
based only on the digestive system. The reproductive system can also be used to differentiate 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. burnupi
</tp:taxon-name>
. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
, the retractor muscle for the penis inserts near the heart on the right side of the visceral cavity (i.e., in the posterior half or third of the cavity) while it inserts at the posterior end of the cavity in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
the deferent duct is closely attached to the oviduct (in the posterior reproductive system), while it is only loosely attached to it in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. burnupi
</tp:taxon-name>
. This trait also differs slightly between 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
: the deferent duct, which is closely attached to the oviduct in both species, is almost straight in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
and highly-convoluted, with tight, U-shaped turns in 
<tp:taxon-name>

Stoliczka’s illustration of the external appearance of 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
clearly shows a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
slug (
Stoliczka 1869
: fig. 2). In his description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tigrinum
, Stoliczka
</tp:taxon-name>
emphasized the flattened shape of the slug, the narrow foot and the hardened notum, which are all diagnostic of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
. Other aspects of the original description are also in agreement with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
: a granular dorsal surface, a foot from one third to one fourth the total width of the body, dorsal eyes on papillae of the notum and a male opening above the right oral lobe. Therefore,

      <p>
Stoliczka’s description of the color of the ventral surface is as follows: “Young specimens have the mantle below uniform light bluish with very numerous and white dots; large ones have occasionally a number of dark green or rusty, more or less confluent spots along the lateral margins, and the general colour is pale. The foot (...) is of a uniform dark bluish grey colour.” (
Stoliczka 1869: 106
). The color of Stoliczka’s young specimens perfectly matches the species described here and the color of the large ones is also within the observed color variation. The species treated here is the only one that we found at the 
type
locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
with a blue-grey ventral surface, strongly suggesting that the name 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
applies to the species described here. Also, Stoliczka mentioned that, at the 
type
locality, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
was common and found crawling on old wood, which is in complete agreement with our observations in the field, including at the

There is, however, a problem with Stoliczka’s original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
. Indeed, 
Stoliczka (1869: 107)
stated that the “internal vas deferens is about 
5 inches
, and its supplementary albuminous string [Stoliczka’s term for the accessory penial gland] about 
8 inches
long.” An accessory penial gland is not present in any species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
and this strongly suggests that a species from another genus was part of the type material, although it cannot be excluded that he made a mistake. Thus, the designation of a 
neotype
is needed because it allows us to ensure that, in the future, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
will always apply to the species described here. The designation of a 
neotype
is far more preferable to a 
lectotype
designation based on an illustration or description. Indeed, even though the species described here is the only 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
we found at the type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
, it cannot be excluded that other species, especially 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
, will be found there in the future. Because 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
are hardly distinguishable externally, it is possible that Stoliczka also examined some specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
. For all the reasons above, the 
neotype
designated here efficiently clarifies the application of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
.

In his remarks on 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium coriaceum
, Semper (1882: 273)
</tp:taxon-name>
addressed the similarity between the species he described and Stoliczka’s description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
. Semper pointed out that the only difference between the two descriptions is the presence of an accessory penial gland in 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
, but doubted that one was actually present in Stoliczka’s specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
. Semper considered 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
to be a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
(although with a question mark), even though he was not able to properly compare the anatomy of the two species, and even though, strictly speaking, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
had priority over 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
is shown here to be genetically and anatomically distinct from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
.

      <p>
Hoffmann (1928: 77)
noted Semper’s comments on the similarity between 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium tigrinum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis stuxbergi
</tp:taxon-name>
, but did not provide additional comments on the species or add new localities. Hoffmann’s indication that the species was from “Port Canning (
Penang
, Malayische Halbinsel)” [
Penang
, Peninsular 
Malaysia
] appears to be a mistake for Stoliczka’s locality of Port Canning in 
West Bengal
, 
India
. 
Labbé (1934: 223)
repeated Hoffmann’s erroneous record but did not provide new information about the species.

The type material of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
, a species originally described by 
Britton (1984)
from 
Hong Kong
, includes a 
holotype
by original designation (NHMUK 1982288) and three 
paratypes
(NHMUK 1982289/1,2 and NHMUK 1982289/3). The 
holotype
(18/ 
16 mm
) is missing both the male and female reproductive parts, which were not described in detail by Britton. Also, its digestive system is largely destroyed (the intestinal loops cannot be observed) even though the radula remains. The two largest 
paratypes
(22/18 and 15/ 
15 mm
) are empty of all internal organs. All organs remain in the smallest (9/ 
9 mm
) 
paratype
but it is not fully mature (the posterior, female reproductive parts are only partly developed). The intestinal loops of the smallest 
paratype
are clearly of type II. Britton did not describe the color of the ventral surface (foot and hyponotum) of live animals. He only mentioned that the preserved 
holotype
and two preserved 
paratypes
(NHMUK 1982289/1,2) were brown with a darker mantle rim, while the third 
paratype
(NHMUK 1982289/3) was grey with darker mottling. However, the dorsal color is useless for identifying species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
and a brown dorsal surface with a darker mantle rim (color of the 
holotype
) could apply to any species. Britton’s description of the type of intestinal loops is also problematic. He described intestinal loops of type I in the 
holotype
, of type II in what he called the “grey 
paratype
” (NHMUK 1982289/3), which is the largest 
paratype
, and intermediate between types I and II in the smallest 
paratype
. Intestinal loops of type II are clearly present in the smallest 
paratype
(the only type specimen with remaining intestinal loops) which Britton called the “smaller brown 
paratype
.” There are three possible explanations for that. First, Britton correctly described the intestinal loops of the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
(the only specimen with a name-bearing function) and the name 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
cannot apply to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
, two species with intestinal loops of type II and which are known to be present in 
Hong Kong
(see below). However, the name 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
could apply to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
, a species with intestinal loops of type I, but which is not known from 
Hong Kong
(although it is known from the 
Philippines
and 
Vietnam
, among other places). Second, it is also possible (and quite likely) that Britton simply made a mistake in identifying the type of the intestinal loops in the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
because he also misidentified the intestinal type in another onchidiid that he called 
<tp:taxon-name>
Paraoncidium reevesii
(J.E. 
Gray, 1850
)
</tp:taxon-name>
(see 

Goulding 
et al
. 2018b

). If Britton misidentified the intestinal loops in the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
, the description would be compatible with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Third, it is also possible that the original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
was based on specimens from two different species (one with a type I and one with a type II), even though, strictly speaking, only the 
holotype
is the name-bearer. Because Britton’s description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
is confusing and since critical characters cannot be checked in the type material, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
is regarded as a nomen dubium. It does apply to a species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
, but which one cannot be confidently determined.

DNA sequences of onchidiids from 
China
published by 

Sun 
et al
. (2014)

show that there are several species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
China
and at least two in 
Hong Kong
. For unclear reasons, Sun 
et al
. applied the name 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
to all Chinese onchidiids with a bluish-grey hyponotum and foot. By comparing their DNA sequences with ours, we have determined that the sequenced specimens they called 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
and

Zhang 
et al
. (2017)

recently re-described a species they identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
based on specimens from 
Hong Kong
. This description did not address the inconsistency in the original description regarding the intestinal loops and appears to be based on multiple species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
. Despite the fact that COI sequences from 

Sun 
et al
. (2014)

showed that several species of this genus are present in 
China
, including two in 
Hong Kong
, Zhang 
et al
. did not discuss how the species they re-described was different from other sympatric species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
. Photographs of live specimens by Zhang 
et al
. clearly show that there are two different kinds of ventral coloration. The individual with a blue-grey foot and hyponotum (

Zhang 
et al
. 2017

: fig. 1c) was either 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
(both could potentially be present in 
Hong Kong
), and the individual with a bright orange foot (

<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi

         <tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex tigrinus

is distributed from western 
India
to southern 
China
(
Hong Kong
). It is one of few onchidiid species which is broadly distributed from the Indian Ocean to the South 
China
Sea. It was not found in 
Tamil Nadu
(southeastern 
India
) during our recent (2016) survey in the mangroves of Pichavaram, but the diversity of mangrove molluscs was very low. Further exploration of southeastern 
India
could reveal whether 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
is present in low abundance, whether it varies in abundance seasonally, or is simply absent.
