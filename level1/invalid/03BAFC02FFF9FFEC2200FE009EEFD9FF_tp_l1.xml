Remarks
</p>
      <p>
Bogoslovsky (1955)
introduced the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sphaeropharciceras
</tp:taxon-name>
; the species 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. sandbergerorum
</tp:taxon-name>
, which was newly named by him at the same time, was determined as the 
type
species. This species was based on an illustration by 
Sandberger &amp; Sandberger (1850
–1856: pl. 9 fig. 2), in which a small (
13 mm
conch diameter), almost globular specimen is shown.
</p>
      <p>
The specimen was then figured and briefly discussed by House (in 
House &amp; Ziegler 1977
: pl. 5 figs 24–26). House concluded that the distorted specimen has to be included in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pharciceras tridens
</tp:taxon-name>
. Unfortunately, this specimen is now considered lost; therefore, it cannot be verified whether it is indeed to be considered a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tridens
</tp:taxon-name>
. Owing to the small size, however, it should hardly be possible to formulate a satisfactory species diagnosis.
