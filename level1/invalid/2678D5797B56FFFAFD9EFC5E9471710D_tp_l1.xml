Remarks
</p>
      <p>
Among the collected material from 
South Carolina
, 
USA
, 
two adult
females were found, both having large, rigid and backwards bending primary clavae supported by strong internal cuticular structures at their bases, as well as three pairs of lateral alae supported by ramuli. These specimens likely present yet another species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Higginsarctus
</tp:taxon-name>
gen. nov.
, different to the new species described above. Unfortunately, further details cannot be accessed due to the poor condition of the specimens.
</p>
      <p>
In addition to the two unidentifiable adult specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Higginsarctus
</tp:taxon-name>
gen. nov.
, two larval specimens were found; a 2-clawed larva from Roscoff, 
France
and a 2-clawed larva from 
South Carolina
, 
USA
. Both larvae possess large, rigid and backwards bending primary clavae supported by strong internal cuticular structures at their bases, a character shared by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ligiarctus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Higginsarctus
</tp:taxon-name>
gen. nov.
At this larval stage, alae are not present. Co-occurring only with adult specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Higginsarctus
</tp:taxon-name>
gen. nov.
(no adult specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ligiarctus
</tp:taxon-name>
were found in the samples), these larvae most likely belongs to the new genus. However, the conclusion as to whether they belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ligiarctus
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
Higginsarctus
</tp:taxon-name>
gen. nov.
cannot be made with certainty.
