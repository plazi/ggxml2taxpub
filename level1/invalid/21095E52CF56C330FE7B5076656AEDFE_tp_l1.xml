         <tp:taxon-name>
Denticupachydomella bellcanyonensis
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
is very similar to the 
type
species 
<tp:taxon-name>
Denticupachydomella spinosa
Yuan
</tp:taxon-name>
in 

Yuan 
et al

from the Changhsingian of South 
China
(

) but is larger and lacks the two horny spines at the anterior and posterior cardinal angles. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Denticupachydomella bellcanyonensis
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Denticupachydomella multinodosa
</tp:taxon-name>
(Forel in 

Crasquin 
et al.
2010

) from the Changhsingian (Late Permian) of 
Sichuan
, south-west 
China
(

Crasquin 
et al.
2010

) by the presence of a postero-ventral spine and by the organisation of nodules along dorsal and ventral margins at both valves. Herein, the dorso-central shoulder at RV is absent and the surface is covered by nodules. The species from the Late Capitanian of the Penglaitan section (Guadalupuan–Lopingian GSSP) in 
Guangxi
, South 
China
(
Zazzali 2016
: fig. 13o–p, unpublished material) differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Denticupachydomella bellcanyonensis
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
by a more elongate carapace and a PB with smaller radius of curvature. The species from the Penglaitan section is also new and has to be described.
