The enigmatic 
<tp:taxon-name>
G. koshovi
(
Bazikalova, 1946
)
</tp:taxon-name>
was collected in Lake Khubsugul of northeastern 
Mongolia
(
Fig. 1
) and was reported in several previous publications (see 

Erbaeva 
et al.
1990

; 
Safronov 2006
; 
Dulmaa 2009
), which has now necessitated a comparative study of this species with that in the remote Tore-Khol population of the 
Uvs
Nuur Basin. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Gammarus koshovi
</tp:taxon-name>
from Khubsugul was described rather superficially; a 
holotype
was not deposited, which complicates detailed comparison. Furthermore, actual sampling of the Khubsugulian gammarids was not possible for correct comparisons.Although the original 
<tp:taxon-name>
G. koshovi
</tp:taxon-name>
vs that in the Tore-Khol population exhibit differences, their pattern and variability are not clear (
Table 1
). Nevertheless, we consider these two forms to be closely related and belonging to the same lineage and united by the following: common fossorial morphotype (compact body, abbreviated antennae, spacious coxal plates, and strong, short pereopods with robust dactyli), presence of calceoli in antenna II of males, armament and gnathopod shape in both sexes, armament of urosomal segments, furnishing of pereopods, uropods, and telson. 
Bazikalova (1946)
ignored the morphology of the carpi of pereopods III and IV. Additionally, her indication that antenna I comprised 25% of the entire body length with the number of articles 11–12 (
♂♂
) and 8–12 (
♀♀
) for 
7–8 mm
long specimens is doubtful. It should be noted that 
<tp:taxon-name>
G. koshovi
</tp:taxon-name>
is related to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Gammarus
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Gurjanova (1930)
described from Yenisey’s riffle (downstream of Krasnoyarsk) based on several juvenile specimens with well-developed marsupial plates. 
Gurjanova (1930)
compared the Yenisey form with juveniles of

G. pulex
</tp:taxon-name>

G. lacustris

) from Karelia and the Polar Urals (see also 
Kessler 1868
) and found them sharply different. Among the Central Asian members of

(
Martynov 1935
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, the Tuvan-Mongolian 
<tp:taxon-name>
G. koshovi
</tp:taxon-name>
, because of its small size, gravitates to a poorly distinguishable species from the springs of Turkestan, but the forms described by Martynov, despite their small size, still possess elongated antennae and not shortened pereopods, and are clearly distinguishable by their reduced eyes (see also 
<tp:taxon-name>

Sidorov, Hou &amp; Sket, 
2018

in

<tp:taxon-name>
Gammarus
</tp:taxon-name>
(

Zhao

, possibly the basin of the middle Yenisey, is inhabited by a small burrower-like form of

Distribution and ecology
</p>
      <p>
Previously recorded from the area of Pupok Island in Khubsugul Lake (
Fig. 1
), a burrower-like gammarid form that dwells on silty sand at a depth of 
15–16 m
(
Bazikalova 1946
). Details of its biology in Khubsugul are lacking (
Dulmaa 2009
), but for Bazikalova to rely on the ʻburrowing morphotypeʼ implies its fossorial behavior. We have no direct observations of the burrowing behavior of the species, except that the samples were collected by bottom grabs in the Tore-Khol on muddy bald patches devoid of vegetation.
