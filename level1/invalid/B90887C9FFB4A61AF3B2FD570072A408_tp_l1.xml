Remarks

      <p>
Voet (1778?) described 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cerambyx ypsilon
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. 11
) from “ 
<tp:taxon-name>America</tp:taxon-name>
septentrionali”.According to Santos- Silva 
et al.
(2010) on 
<tp:taxon-name>
Polyrhaphis spinosa
(Drury, 1773)
</tp:taxon-name>
(translated from Portuguese): “…it is worth noting that this work was successively added to new parts from 1766 onward and, contrary to what appears in almost all the catalogs on 
<tp:taxon-name>Cerambycidae</tp:taxon-name>
, many species are before 1778 and were already published in 1776 (
Beckmann 1776
). 
Sherborn (1902)
was probably the first to report that Voet’s work (
op. cit
.) did not follow the binominal system … Anyway, in relation to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Polyrhaphis spinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
, the name used by Voet (
op. cit.
), only appeared after 1776 because, according to Beckmann (
op. cit.
), in that year the work only included 14 species in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cerambyx
</tp:taxon-name>
and eight pages (
<tp:taxon-name>
Cerambyx horridus
</tp:taxon-name>
was published on page 15, as species number 59). With the death of Johannes Eusebius Voet, in 1778, the work was unfinished, but in 1796 volume II, in which 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cerambyx
</tp:taxon-name>
was addressed, already had 24 pages and 24 prints (
Dryander &amp; Banks 1796
). As the work did not undergo additions between 1778 (Voet’s passing) and 1804 [British Museum (Natural History) 1915], Voet had undoubtedly already included 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cerambyx horridus
</tp:taxon-name>
[= 
<tp:taxon-name>
Polyrhaphis spinosa
</tp:taxon-name>
] in his work.” The same reasoning can be used regarding 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cerambyx ypsilon
</tp:taxon-name>
, which was published on page 11 (Latin part). Nevertheless, the names published by 
Voet (1766
– 1806) cannot be considered as nomenclaturally available, as has been indicated by some authors, for example, 
Alonso-Zarazaga &amp; Lyal (1999)
, 

Santos-Silva 
et al.
(2010)

, and 
Krell (2012)
.
</p>
      <p>
Schönherr (1817)
synonymized 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cerambyx ypsilon
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cerambyx araneiformis
Linnaeus, 1767
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Dillon (1956)
described 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lagocheirus stroheckeri granulatus
</tp:taxon-name>
based on males and females from the 
USA
(
Texas
), and 
Linsley &amp; Chemsak (1995)
synonymized it with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. araneiformis ypsilon
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Dillon (1957)
considered 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. ypsilon
</tp:taxon-name>
as a subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lagocheirus araneiformis
</tp:taxon-name>
, without comment about the synonymy proposed by 
Schönherr (1817)
, which is also present in 
Aurivillius (1922)
, and 
Blackwelder (1946)
. In the same work, 
Dillon (1957)
synonymized 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. parvulus
</tp:taxon-name>
with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. araneiformis ypsilon
</tp:taxon-name>
, which was described by 
Casey (1913)
based on a single male from 
Panama
. Currently, the species is known as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lagocheirus araneiformis ypsilon
</tp:taxon-name>
, with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. parvulus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. stroheckeri granulatus
</tp:taxon-name>
as junior synonyms.
</p>
      <p>
It is not possible to be sure whether 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cerambyx ypsilon
</tp:taxon-name>
is really synonymous with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lagocheirus parvulus
Casey, 1913
</tp:taxon-name>
(generic name published as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lagochirus
</tp:taxon-name>
, attributed to 
Erichson (1847)
, but 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lagocheirus
</tp:taxon-name>
is by 
Dejean (1835))
. This is because the short description and drawing in Voet (1778?) do not allow confirmation. Unfortunately, Voet’s collection is probably lost; according to 

Santos-Silva 
et al.
(2010)

discussing 
<tp:taxon-name>
Polyrhaphis armiger
(
Schönherr, 1817
)
</tp:taxon-name>
(translated from Portuguese): “According to British Museum (Natural History) (1915), the stock from Johannes Eusebius Voet was acquired by Bakhuysen in 1804. We do not know whether Voet’s insect collection was part of the material acquired by G. Bakhuysen, but according to Reichard (1827), this insect collection remained in La Haye: “La Haye. Cette ville, qui n’a ni murs ni portes, est entourée d’un large fossé sur lequel on a pratiqué des ponts-levis. Elle surpasse néanmoins plusieurs villes célèbres par la magnificence de ses bâtimens et ses autres ornemens. 
Curiosités:
… les cabinets d’insectes de MM. Voet et Meuschen, le cabinet de conquillages de M. Lyonnet”… [The Hague. This city, which has neither walls nor gates, is surrounded by a wide moat over which drawbridges have been made. It nevertheless surpasses several famous cities by the magnificence of its buildings and its other ornaments. 
Curiosities
: … the insect cabinets of Voet and Meuschen, the cabinet of shells of Mr. Lyonnet …].” However, it is not within the scope of this work to verify previously proposed synonymies, but only to solve the problem related to the correct name of the species/ subspecies. As 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lagocheirus parvulus
</tp:taxon-name>
is the oldest available name, it is used instead of “ 
<tp:taxon-name>
ypsilon
</tp:taxon-name>
”. Accordingly, the name of the subspecies is 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. araneiformis parvulus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
      <p>
The specimens from 
Honduras
examined by us (
Fig. 12
) agree well with several specimens identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. araneiformis ypsilon
</tp:taxon-name>
in MZSP collection. However, comparing the original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. stroheckeri
Dillon, 1956
</tp:taxon-name>
(currently, 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. araneiformis stroheckeri
</tp:taxon-name>
), as well as photographs of the 
holotype
and 
allotype
of this species with the specimens usually identified as 

L. a. 
<tp:taxon-name>ypsilon</tp:taxon-name>

, the only reliable difference we have found is the more angulate humerus in 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. stroheckeri
</tp:taxon-name>
. This suggests that the current subspecies of 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. araneiformis
</tp:taxon-name>
need a full revision because at least part of them may be just variations of the same taxon (especially 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. stroheckeri
</tp:taxon-name>
, which is probably synonymous with 
<tp:taxon-name>
L. parvulus
</tp:taxon-name>
).
