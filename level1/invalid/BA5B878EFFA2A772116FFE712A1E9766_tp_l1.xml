Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
The new species is very close to 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. fianarantsoa
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
, differing distinctly in its longer fore tarsus with segment 4 black and simple, segment 2 distinctly shorter than segment 3. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Amblypsilopus fianarantsoa
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
differs from the new species in the fore tarsomere 4 yellow, flattened and widened, with posterior comb of 8–9 long flattened setae, segment 2 as long as segment 3. The fore basitarsus is 2–3 times as long as fore tibia, and the last segment of the fore tarsus is white in both species.
