Description
</p>
      <p>
Color and morphology of live animals
(
Fig. 36
)
</p>
      <p>Live animals are not covered with mud and their natural color can be seen without washing. The notum is bumpy with prominent, distinctly-raised papillae (with or without dorsal eyes). Live animals may become nearly hemispherical when disturbed. The dorsal color is variable although it is typically brown with yellow longitudinal (irregular) lines. Slugs with an entirely dark brown notum or a light beige notum also occur. The hyponotum is light grey and almost translucent in small specimens. The margin of the hyponotum is frequently translucent with the brown color of the notum showing through. The foot is light yellow.</p>
      <p>
Papillae with dorsal eyes are present. Their exact number is difficult to determine, as they are often retracted, but ranges approximately from 4 to 26, except in the case of very small specimens, in which as few as 2 dorsal eyes have been observed. Each papilla bears one dorsal eye. Dorsal eyes may be distributed across the notum or only present in the middle but are always absent on the margin (i.e., eyes are never &lt;
2 mm
from the notum edge).

Digestive system

</p>
      <p>
Radulae measure up to 
4.3 mm
in length. Examples of radular formulae are presented in 
Table 5
. Due to the high genetic divergence (in COI sequences) between populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
, radulae are figured from 
Indonesia
, 
Mauritius
and 
Papua New Guinea
(

type
I, with a transitional loop oriented between 1 and 2 o’clock (

Reproductive system
(
Figs 41–44
)
</p>
      <p>
In the posterior part of the reproductive system, the oviduct is wider than the deferent duct (up to twice as wide). Its distal section (distal to the spermatheca) is slightly longer than its proximal section (up to two or three times as wide) or equal to it in length. The deferent duct is longer than the oviduct, loosely attached to it, and varies from slightly convoluted with a few loose loops to tightly coiled with U-shaped loops (
Fig. 41
). The position of the female pore varies from being adjacent to the anus to 
4 mm
away from it in large specimens. The flexible, distal region of the penis with hooks measures approximately 
1.5 to 3 mm
in length. In eastern 
Indonesia
, the distal region is 
2 to 3 mm
long, while in 
Mauritius
and 
Papua New Guinea
it is approximately 
1.5 to 2 mm
long. The penial hooks are large and can be seen inside the semi-transparent penis. They are usually 
45 to 90 µm
long (
Figs 43
, 
44A
), but between 
20 to 60 µm
in smaller specimens from 
Mauritius
(
Fig. 44
B–C). The insertion of the penial retractor muscle varies. It inserts at the posterior end of the visceral cavity in specimens from eastern 
Indonesia
, except in a few specimens in which it inserts approximately ¾ down the length of the visceral cavity. It inserts approximately halfway to ¾ down the length of the visceral cavity in specimens from 
Papua New Guinea
(and near the posterior end of the visceral cavity in one specimen). In 
Mauritius
, it inserts at the posterior end of the visceral cavity in the largest specimen, and by the heart halfway down the visceral cavity in a smaller specimen. The length of the retractor muscle varies from much shorter than the penial sheath (
1
/ 
5
to 
1
/ 
3
of its length) to as long as the penial sheath. The deferent duct is not particularly long and is only loosely convoluted (
Fig. 42
). It may even be nearly straight in immature specimens (
Fig. 42C
).

from other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
, except 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
, which is characterized by similar prominent dorsal papillae. The dorsal coloration of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex applanatus

is much more variable than in other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
. However, the dorsal notum of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
is frequently marked by bright yellowish-green markings or bands, which were very rarely observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>

<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
can also be distinguished from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
based on reproductive anatomy. The deferent duct in the posterior reproductive system is more closely attached to the oviduct, longer and more highly coiled in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
than in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
. The distal region of the oviduct (distal to the spermatheca) is also longer in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
than in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Finally, the distal region of the penis with hooks is longer in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(up to 
3 mm
) than in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
(up to 
1 mm
). The insertion of the retractor muscle varies greatly within 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
(it may insert at the posterior end of the visceral cavity or near the heart), so this character does not help to reliably distinguish it from

Onchidium applanatum
</tp:taxon-name>
was originally described from the Aru Islands. Fresh material was collected from the Kei Islands, very close to Aru. The 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium applanatum
</tp:taxon-name>
is small (15/ 
12 mm
) but its flattened shape, the presence of a rectal gland and no accessory penial gland all indicate that it is a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
slug. The prominent papillae on its dorsal notum and its digestive system of type I are compatible with the species described here as well as 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
. However, the retractor muscle of the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. applanatum
</tp:taxon-name>
is very long and inserts near the posterior end of the visceral cavity, which is only compatible with the species described here (in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
, the retractor muscle inserts near the heart). Therefore, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
is applied to the species described here from the Kei Islands and 
Ambon
.

Hoffmann (1928: 84–85)
and 
Labbé (1934: 225–226)
considered that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium applanatum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium tabularis
Tapparone-Canefri, 1883
</tp:taxon-name>
were both junior synonyms of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium planatum
Quoy &amp; Gaimard, 1825
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium planatum
</tp:taxon-name>
, originally described from 
Guam
, may not even refer to an onchidiid based on the brief written description. Two pieces of a notum were located recently at the MNHN which are part of the 
type
series of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. planatum
</tp:taxon-name>
(MNHN-IM-2000-33706). However, these are so poorly preserved that it is not possible to determine whether they were part of an onchidiid slug. 
Tapparone-Canefri’s (1883)
description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. tabularis
</tp:taxon-name>
from Wokam, Aru Islands, does not mention the internal anatomy, and the 
type
specimens could not be located. As a result, both 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium planatum
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium tabularis
</tp:taxon-name>
are considered here nomina dubia. 
Labbé’s (1934: 225–226)
specimens identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. planatum
</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Guam
, 
New Caledonia
and 
Mauritius
(as île de 
France
) cannot belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. applanatus
</tp:taxon-name>
or any other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
due to the presence of a penial gland.
