Shell medium-sized, length 
80.9–102.2 mm
, height 
26.2–37.2 mm
, width 
13.6–19.1 mm
(
Table 3
). Shell rather thin, narrow and elongated (H/L ratio = 0.32–0.36), very inequilateral, compressed. Dorsal margin straight, anterior at the same level as posterior. Umbonal area eroded, not elevated. Anterior margin round; posterior margin elongated and rounded. Ventral margin almost straight, slightly curved upward posteriorly. Posterior ridges low, wide and obtuse, not prominent. Periostracum thin, greenish to dark brown, the eroded part coppery-brown. Shell surface with fine growth lines. Ligament very narrow. Hinge without dentition, posterior end of the hinge structure with V-shaped fossette. Anterior adductor muscle scar placed relatively far from the dorsal margin, shallow, ovate, fused with pedal retractor muscle scars; posterior adductor muscle scars very shallow, almost invisible. Pallial line very faint. Nacre whitish with cream tint near the umbo. Excurrent aperture smooth, shorter than incurrent. Incurrent with 1–2 rows of conical papillae, varying in length. Small epithelial folds form a fused bridge separating excurrent and incurrent aperture. Gills elongated and slightly ribbed. Anterior margin of inner gills slightly longer and wider than that of inner outer gills. Glochidia unknown.

Distribution
</p>
      <p>
This new species appears to occur in the Lower Mekong watershed. In 
Laos
, it was recorded from several locations near 
Vientiane
, Kammoune, and 
Champasak
Provinces. In 
Thailand
, it is known from the Songkram and Mun river basins in the northeast region (
Brandt 1974
).

Habitat
</p>
      <p>
Specimens of the new species were bought on a local market near the Xe Bangfai River. However, specimens from the Thuai and Songkhram Rivers in 
Thailand
were found buried in the mud substrate of still water. 
Brandt (1974)
also reported ponds as a general habitat of this species.

         <p>
The specimens recorded by 
Brandt (1974)
from Nang Rong, 
Buriram
, 
Thailand
(SMF-220822) show a shorter but wider shell and a relative rounded ventral margin. In addition, although the hinge area of this species has no dentition, the trace of a rudimentary pseudocardinal tooth is seen as a very tiny tubercle in some individuals.

Differential diagnosis
</p>
            <p>
This species resembles the 
type
species, but it can be distinguished by the relatively smaller size with a shell length of 67.0–81.0 mm (vs 
80.9–102.2 mm
), anterior adductor muscle scar placed near the dorsal margin (vs relatively far from the dorsal margin), adductor muscle scar relatively deep for the thin shell (vs shallower, although thicker shell), nacre yellowish (vs whitish), anterior margin rounded and little shouldered (vs wider and not shouldered), and the anterior portion of the dorsal margin somewhat lower than the posterior (vs at the same level in both anterior and posterior portions).

Additional description
</p>
            <p>Examination of the soft body of newly collected specimens in this study yielded additional description of the animal: excurrent aperture smooth, shorter than incurrent; incurrent with 1–2 rows of conical papillae, similar in length; small epithelial folds form a fused bridge separating excurrent and incurrent aperture; gills elongated and slightly ribbed; anterior margin of inner gills slightly longer and wider than that of outer gills. However, no brooding specimens were available to examine glochidia.</p>

Distribution
</p>
            <p>
This species is restricted to Tonle Sap Lake and its tributaries in 
Cambodia

Thailand
(
Brandt 1974
).

Remarks
</p>
            <p>
This species has been noted for its rarity (
Brandt 1974
; 

Ng 
et al.
2020

). Only a few lots are available in museum collections. We obtained additional fresh materials from the Kampong Kdei River, 
Siem Reap Province
. These specimens resemble the 
syntype
MNHN-MP-3150 (
Fig. 5D
). The only detected variations are less erosion of the umbo area and more yellowish-brown colour of the periostracum. 
Morelet (1875)
described 
<tp:taxon-name>
Anodonta lemeslei
</tp:taxon-name>
based on specimens collected by M. Le Mesle. The figured specimen is eroded, with a concave ventral margin (
Fig. 5B–C
), while another shell has a relatively parallel shell and a straight ventral margin (
Fig. 5D
). 
Morelet (1875)
identified the ventrally concave specimens as fully-grown individuals, while the ventrally straight specimens were considered to be young individuals. The concavity trait is quite unusual for species that live in stagnant water habitats. Nevertheless, some specimens from Tonle Sap Lake (MNHN-MP-3156) also show the characteristic of a concave ventral margin. However, all of our specimens have a straight ventral margin. This raises some suspicions about the existence of both variations. In this study, we retain both variations as the same species until topotype specimens with concave ventral margin are available for DNA analysis.

Apart from a ventral margin, other morphological variations are also observed. The posterior ends of some specimens are more or less rounded than others. 
Crosse &amp; Fischer (1876)
noted that some specimens from 
Cambodia
are narrower and more elongated than the 
type
figure. The posterior dorsal margin in some specimens is also somewhat higher. 
Morelet (1875)
noted that one of his 
type
specimens is undoubtedly similar to

Khanh Hoa
, 
Vietnam
, is conchologically different and does not belong to this species (
Thach 2007

Do

Differential diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
This species resembles the 
type
species, but it can be distinguished by the relatively smaller size with a shell length of 67.0–81.0 mm (vs 
80.9–102.2 mm
), anterior adductor muscle scar placed near the dorsal margin (vs relatively far from the dorsal margin), adductor muscle scar relatively deep for the thin shell (vs shallower, although thicker shell), nacre yellowish (vs whitish), anterior margin rounded and little shouldered (vs wider and not shouldered), and the anterior portion of the dorsal margin somewhat lower than the posterior (vs at the same level in both anterior and posterior portions).

Description
</p>
      <p>Shell medium-sized, rather thin, narrow and elongated (H/L ratio = 0.39), very inequilateral, compressed. Dorsal margin straight; somewhat lower anteriorly than posteriorly. Umbonal area eroded, not elevated. Anterior margin round, little shouldered; posterior margin elongated, somewhat pointed. Ventral margin almost straight, or minutely concave in the middle in old specimens, posteriorly slightly curved upward. Posterior ridges low, wide and obtuse, not prominent. Periostracum thin, yellowish to dark brown, the eroded part coppery-brown. Shell surface with fine growth lines. Ligament very narrow. Hinge without dentition, posterior end of the hinge structure with V-shaped fossette. Anterior adductor muscle scar placed near the dorsal margin, relatively deep for the thin shell, ovate, fused with pedal retractor muscle scars; posterior adductor muscle scars very shallow, almost invisible. Pallial line very faint. Nacre yellowish with creamy tint near the umbo.</p>
      <p>
Additional description
</p>
      <p>Examination of the soft body of newly collected specimens in this study yielded additional description of the animal: excurrent aperture smooth, shorter than incurrent; incurrent with 1–2 rows of conical papillae, similar in length; small epithelial folds form a fused bridge separating excurrent and incurrent aperture; gills elongated and slightly ribbed; anterior margin of inner gills slightly longer and wider than that of outer gills. However, no brooding specimens were available to examine glochidia.</p>

Distribution
</p>
      <p>
This species is restricted to Tonle Sap Lake and its tributaries in 
Cambodia
. Its distribution probably reaches the headwater of Tonle Sap basin in eastern 
Thailand
(
Brandt 1974
).

Habitat
</p>
      <p>
This species was recorded in mud substrate in still sections of rivers or in lentic habitat, i.e., ponds and lakes (
Morelet 1875
; 
Morlet 1889
; 
Brandt 1974
).

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
This species has been noted for its rarity (
Brandt 1974
; 

Ng 
et al.
2020

). Only a few lots are available in museum collections. We obtained additional fresh materials from the Kampong Kdei River, 
Siem Reap Province
. These specimens resemble the 
syntype
MNHN-MP-3150 (
Fig. 5D
). The only detected variations are less erosion of the umbo area and more yellowish-brown colour of the periostracum. 
Morelet (1875)
described 
<tp:taxon-name>
Anodonta lemeslei
</tp:taxon-name>
based on specimens collected by M. Le Mesle. The figured specimen is eroded, with a concave ventral margin (
Fig. 5B–C
), while another shell has a relatively parallel shell and a straight ventral margin (
Fig. 5D
). 
Morelet (1875)
identified the ventrally concave specimens as fully-grown individuals, while the ventrally straight specimens were considered to be young individuals. The concavity trait is quite unusual for species that live in stagnant water habitats. Nevertheless, some specimens from Tonle Sap Lake (MNHN-MP-3156) also show the characteristic of a concave ventral margin. However, all of our specimens have a straight ventral margin. This raises some suspicions about the existence of both variations. In this study, we retain both variations as the same species until topotype specimens with concave ventral margin are available for DNA analysis.

Apart from a ventral margin, other morphological variations are also observed. The posterior ends of some specimens are more or less rounded than others. 
Crosse &amp; Fischer (1876)
noted that some specimens from 
Cambodia
are narrower and more elongated than the 
type
figure. The posterior dorsal margin in some specimens is also somewhat higher. 
Morelet (1875)
noted that one of his 
type
specimens is undoubtedly similar to

</p>
      <p>
Several records and specimens previously identified as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilsbryoconcha lemeslei
</tp:taxon-name>
have been examined and listed in this species. However, a specimen from 
Khanh Hoa
, 
Vietnam
, is conchologically different and does not belong to this species (
Thach 2007
; 

Do 
et al.
2018

); rather, it is probably a species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pilsbryoconcha
</tp:taxon-name>
. This specimen shows more or less curved ventral margin and relatively wider shell.

, another sympatric species with 
<tp:taxon-name>

, from Tonle Sap Lake, in our phylogenetic analyses. However, without examination of the specimen mentioned in 

Bolotov 
et al.
(2020)

and

(2021)

, it can only be classified to the genus
