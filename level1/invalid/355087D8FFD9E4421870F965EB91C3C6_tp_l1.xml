      <p> Differs from <tp:taxon-name> Chassalia lancifolia </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. in having more
         coriaceous leaves, leaf-blades lanceolate but not oblanceolate; in having a longer peduncle

      <p> Description </p>
      <p> Shrub to small tree, height not stated, but likely to be more than 40 cm tall, glabrous.
         Internodes short, 1–2.5 cm × 2–4 mm , lower internodes terete, upper internodes drying
         slightly compressed and shorter. Leaf-blades narrowly lanceolate, 13.5–29 × 1.5–3.5 cm ,
         margin slightly sinuous when dry, a light yellow line visible very near to margin from apex
         to base; apex acuminate, acumen 1–2 cm , base attenuate, conspicuously decurrent to
         petioles, midrib slightly raised above, domatia absent; secondary nerves 12–16 on each side
         of the midrib, prominent above; tertiary nerves not visible. Petiole with a narrow wing on
         each side, very short, 10–15 × 1–1.5 mm . Stipule triangular to oblong, 5 × 4–5 mm ,
         sometimes when old the chaffy part broken and divided into 2. Inflorescences compound
         cymes, 2–9.5 cm long. Peduncle longitudinally minutely striate, apex slightly compressed,
         1–6.5 cm × 1.5–2.5 mm , rachis and first branches 5–10 × 1–1.5 mm , second internode of
         rachis and second branches absent or very short, 4–5 × 1.5–2 mm . Bracts of second
         internode of rachis and second branches 4, elliptic, 5 × 1–2 mm , bracts of capitulum 2,
         ovate, slightly broader than bracts of partial peduncle, 3–5 × 2–3 mm . Flowers not seen.
         Hypanthium and calyx tube obovoid, 1.5 × 1–1.5 mm , calyx lobes 1.25 × 0.7–1 mm . Fruits
         shiny green, prolate, 7 × 5–6 mm , pedicel short, around 1 mm long. Pyrenes plano-convex,
         compressed, 7 × 6 mm , dorsal surface convex, with two adjacent parallel longitudinal
         crests, each 0.25 mm wide, 0.15 mm apart along their length, 0.2–0.3 mm high, forming a
         longitudinal groove from apex to base between the two crests; ventral surface slightly
         concave, centrally slightly elevated, margin with an endocarpal outgrowth 0.5–0.8 mm wide,
         with a groove between the edge of endocarp and endocarpal outgrowth 0.25 mm wide. Raphal
         opening at base of the endocarpal outgrowth, large, round to trullate, 0.5 mm wide or 1.5
         mm × 0.5 mm if trullate, 0.3–0.4 mm from the edge of the pyrene wall, apex with a bony
         spine, spine triangular, erect, 1 × 0.3 mm . PGS not detected. Seed light brown,
         hemi-ellipsoid, slightly crested at central part of dorsal side, 6 × 0.5 mm , endosperm not
         detected. </p>

      <p> Remarks </p>
      <p> The pyrenes of both this species and <tp:taxon-name> Chassalia lancifolia </tp:taxon-name>
         sp. nov. can be very easily separated into two parts between the raphal opening and the
