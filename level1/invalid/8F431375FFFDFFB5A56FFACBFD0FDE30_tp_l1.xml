Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
This species may be separated from other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Charinus
</tp:taxon-name>
in eastern South America by means of the following combination of characters: large size; cheliceral claw with 13 teeth; pedipalp coxae with seven setae encircled by dorsal rounded carina; secondary series of spines on pedipalp segments present (
Figs 3A– B
, 
49E
); distitibia of leg IV with 
sc
and 
sf
with six trichobothria.

Description
</p>
      <p>
CARAPACE. Frontal process large, subtriangular, not visible in dorsal view (
Fig. 49C
); median eyes and median ocular tubercle present (
Fig. 49A, C
); median ocular tubercle shallow, slightly higher than carapace surface, with pair of small setae (
Fig. 49C
); lateral eyes well developed, pale, small seta posterior to each lateral ocular triad (
Fig. 49A
); lenses directed anteriorly and dorsally.
</p>
      <p>
STERNUM. Tritosternum projected anteriorly into blunt tubercle, surpassing base of pedipalp coxae (
Fig. 49B
); medial platelet (tetrasternum) and third platelet (pentasternum) with single convex platelet, with pair of large setae anteriorly, and several small setae posteriorly; metasternum with five large setae anteriorly at margin between membranous and sclerotized regions, and longitudinal row of several small setae, from anterior to posterior (
Fig. 49B
); four to six setae in posterior area.
</p>
      <p>OPISTHOSOMA. Ventral sacs and ventral sac cover absent.</p>
      <p>
GENITALIA. Male gonopod rectangular (
Fig. 50C
); LoL2 fimbriate with long projections (
Fig. 50B, D
); LoL1 acute, with spine-like projections (
Fig. 50E
); LaM long and thin, surpassing lateral lobes (
Fig. 50A–B
); fistula with small globular projection ventrally (
Fig. 50F
). Female unknown.
</p>
      <p>CHELICERAE. Small tooth in retrolateral row of basal segment; prolateral surface with transverse row of around eight small setae, from ventral to dorsal surface; three setae at dorsodistal margin, prolateral, retromedial and retrolateral, near membranous region of claw; claw with thirteen teeth and row of setae on retrolateral surface from base to near apex (dorsal side).</p>
      <p>
PEDIPALPS. Coxal rounded carina enclosing two to five small setae, and with four to five setae on anterior margin. Femur with three distinct setiferous tubercles proximal to spine 1 (
Figs 3A–B
, 
49E
); primary series with five dorsal spines, with smaller spine between spines 3 and 4, and another smaller spine between spines 4 and 5 (
Figs 3A–B
, 
49E
); five ventral spines, small spine between spines 1 and 2, two small between spines 2 or 3, and small spines between spines 3 and 4, and spines 4 and 5 (
Fig. 49F
); additional spine, situated prolateral to primary series, between spines 1 and 2; large spine proximal to ventral spine 1, with small spine near its base. Pedipalp patella with six dorsal spines (
