Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
Body dorso-ventrally flattened. Notum hard. No dorsal gills. Dorsal eyes present (in most species) or absent (only in two species). Dorsal eyes occur individually, never in groups. Eyes at the tip of short ocular tentacles. Foot narrow, approximately ¼ to ⅓ of total width. Pneumostome median, on ventral hyponotum. Intestinal loops of 
types
I, II or III. Accessory penial gland absent. Male opening below two ocular tentacles, almost centered, but slightly to right side (in dorsal view). Rectal gland present. Penis composed of two regions: rigid proximal region and flexible distal region. Penial hooks in distal region present (in most species) or absent.

Gender
</p>
      <p>
The gender is masculine (ICZN Article 30.1.1). The generic name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
was formed from the family name of the German zoologist Dr. Ludwig H. Plate (1862–1937), professor at Jena, who described several onchidiid species. No gender was specified in 
Baker’s (1938)
original publication of the generic name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
. However, 
Baker (1938: 88)
changed the ending of the specific name 
<tp:taxon-name>
coriacea
</tp:taxon-name>
(combined with the generic name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
Plate, 1893
</tp:taxon-name>
) to 
<tp:taxon-name>
coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
, indicating that he considered 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
to be of masculine gender. Also, the Latin word ‘ 
vindex
’, meaning ‘protector’ or ‘champion’, is masculine. As a result, the ending of all specific names transferred to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
must become masculine (e.g., 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium luteum
</tp:taxon-name>
becomes 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
).

      <p>
Distinctive diagnostic features
</p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
slugs can easily be identified in the field by their dorso-ventrally flattened body, firm notum and very narrow foot (one third of the total width or less when the animal is not active). However, no combination of internal characters is unique to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
. Slugs with a rectal gland and no accessory penial glands are also found in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Melayonchis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidina
</tp:taxon-name>
. Also, among 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Melayonchis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidina
</tp:taxon-name>
slugs, intestinal loops of 
type
I are found only in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
, but intestinal loops of 
type
II are found in all three genera and intestinal loops of 
type
III are found in both 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Melayonchis
</tp:taxon-name>
. The lateral radular teeth of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
are characterized by a slight protuberance on their inner lateral margin (e.g., see arrows on 
Figs 18B
, 
34C
, 
48C
, 
57C
, 
66C
). This kind of radular protuberance is unusual among onchidiids. Apart from in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
, it has been observed only in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Marmaronchis
</tp:taxon-name>
, in which the protuberance is also slight (

Dayrat 
et al.
2018

), and in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Melayonchis
</tp:taxon-name>
, where it is much more conspicuous and sharp (

Dayrat 
et al.
2019c

).

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
Several of the species that belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
were classified in Plate’s genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
Baker (1938)
established the generic name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
as a replacement name for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
Plate, 1893
</tp:taxon-name>
, which he treated as a junior homonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
Herrmannsen, 1847
</tp:taxon-name>
. However, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
Herrmannsen, 1847
</tp:taxon-name>
was a mere nomenclator entry (“ 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
</tp:taxon-name>
- vid. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchis
</tp:taxon-name>
”) which referred to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchis
Férussac, 1822
</tp:taxon-name>
, an available generic name, and which Herrmannsen treated as a full entry. Because 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
</tp:taxon-name>
was not treated as the valid name of a taxon by Herrmannsen (1847), it is not an available name under ICZN Article 11.5.
</p>
      <p>
Regardless of the nomenclatural status of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
Herrmannsen, 1847
</tp:taxon-name>
, the generic name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
Plate, 1893
</tp:taxon-name>
is not available because it is a junior objective synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchis
Férussac, 1822
</tp:taxon-name>
. Indeed, under ICZN Article 33.2.1, one reason for a change in the original spelling of a name to be interpreted as “demonstrably intentional” is “when two or more names in the same work are treated in a similar way.” In his revision of the onchidiids, 
Plate (1893)
changed the original spelling of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium
</tp:taxon-name>
to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncidium
</tp:taxon-name>
, that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidina
</tp:taxon-name>
to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncidina
</tp:taxon-name>
, and that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidella
Gray, 1850
</tp:taxon-name>
to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncidiella
</tp:taxon-name>
. It is thus obvious that 
Plate (1893)
considered that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
</tp:taxon-name>
was a “demonstrably intentional” spelling change from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchis
</tp:taxon-name>
. The generic name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
Plate, 1893
</tp:taxon-name>
is thus an emendation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchis
Férussac, 1822
</tp:taxon-name>
, but it is an unjustified emendation because 
Plate’s (1893)
correction was not made in accordance with Article 32.5. As an unjustified emendation, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
Plate, 1893
</tp:taxon-name>
is a junior objective synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchis
Férussac, 1822
</tp:taxon-name>
and it enters in homonymy (Article 33.2.3). The fact that 
Plate (1893: 164)
claimed that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
</tp:taxon-name>
was a new generic name does not change the fact that, according to the Code, it is treated as an unjustified emendation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchis
Férussac, 1822
</tp:taxon-name>
. Interestingly, several authors already treated 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
Plate, 1893
</tp:taxon-name>
as a junior objective synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchis
Férussac, 1822
</tp:taxon-name>
. For instance, according to 
Woodward (1894: 57)
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
Plate, 1893
</tp:taxon-name>
is a “ 
nom
. preocc. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchis
</tp:taxon-name>
(

i.e., 
<tp:taxon-name>Oncis</tp:taxon-name>

), Fér., = 
<tp:taxon-name>
Peronia
, Blainv.
</tp:taxon-name>
”. Also, 
Woodward (1894: 57)
designated 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis coriacea
</tp:taxon-name>
as the 
type
species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
</tp:taxon-name>
. Regardless, being a junior objective synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchis
Férussac, 1822
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
Plate, 1893
</tp:taxon-name>
is objectively invalid. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
Plate, 1893
</tp:taxon-name>
actually refers to the taxon of which the 
type
species is 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium peronii
Cuvier, 1804
</tp:taxon-name>
(i.e., the 
type
species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchis
Férussac, 1822
</tp:taxon-name>
), and thus refers to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Peronia
Fleming, 1822
</tp:taxon-name>
, not 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
(

Dayrat 
et al.
2020

)
</tp:taxon-name>
. As a result, the valid generic name for the genus revised here is 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
, which 
Baker (1938)
rightly established as a new generic name to refer to the taxon erroneously named 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis
</tp:taxon-name>
by 
Plate (1893)
, even though the justification provided by Baker was not completely appropriate. Finally, 
Baker (1938: 87)
correctly pointed out that the generic name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Semperella
Labbé, 1934
</tp:taxon-name>
was a junior homonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Semperella
Gray, 1868
</tp:taxon-name>
(Porifera). 
Baker (1938: 87)
considered 
<tp:taxon-name>
Semperella
Labbé
</tp:taxon-name>
as a subjective synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
but provided no explanation; 
<tp:taxon-name>
Semperella
Labbé
</tp:taxon-name>
was later replaced by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Semperoncis
Starobogatov, 1976
</tp:taxon-name>
, which refers to a genus of terrestrial onchidiids (
Dayrat 2009
, 
2010
).
