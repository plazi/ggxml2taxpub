            <p> Description </p>
            <p> Color and morphology of live animals ( Fig. 46 ) The dorsal notum of live animals
                  can be covered with mud, in which case their color may be obscured until they are
                  washed. The dorsal notum is brown with dark brown or black markings. The hyponotum
                  is light blue-grey and the foot is yellow. Papillae with dorsal eyes are present.
                  Their exact number is variable, approximately from 15 to 38 were observed in
                  specimens from South Africa and between 12 and 20 were observed in specimens from
                  Madagascar . Each papilla bears one dorsal eye. Eyes are distributed across the
                  notum but are absent from the margin (i.e., eyes are never &lt; 2 mm from the
                  notum edge). </p>
            <p> Digestive system ( Figs 2G , 47–48B , 53 ) Radulae measure up to 3.3 mm in length.
                  Examples of radular formulae are presented in Table 5 . The intestinal loops are
                  of type II, with a transitional loop oriented at approximately 7 o’clock ( Figs 2G
                  , 48A , 53 ). </p>

            <p> Reproductive system ( Figs 49–51 ) In the posterior (female) reproductive system,
                  the oviduct is short, wider than the deferent duct (approximately twice as wide).
                  The length of its distal section (distal to the spermatheca) is shorter than or
                  equal to that of its proximal section. The deferent duct is slightly longer than
                  the oviduct, is only loosely attached to it and varies from loosely to tightly
                  coiled ( Fig. 49 ). The female pore is approximately 0.5 to 2 mm from the anus.
                  The distal, flexible region of the penis with hooks is 1 to 1.5 mm long. Penial
                  hooks are large, between 25 to 70 µm long ( Fig. 51A ), and can be seen inside the
                  semi-transparent penis. The retractor muscle of the penis inserts on the right
                  side at the posterior end of the visceral cavity (from the posterior end of the
                  heart, up to the posterior end of the visceral cavity). The length of the
                  retractor muscle varies from half the length of the penial sheath to approximately
                  two times its length ( Fig. 50B ). The deferent duct is highly convoluted. </p>

            <p>
                  <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex burnupi </tp:taxon-name> is the only known species of
                        <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex </tp:taxon-name> from the western Indian Ocean.
                  It can be distinguished from <tp:taxon-name> P. martensi </tp:taxon-name> and
                        <tp:taxon-name> P. aptei </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. by its grey hyponotum and
                  yellow foot, and from <tp:taxon-name> P. amboinae </tp:taxon-name> and
                        <tp:taxon-name> P. latus </tp:taxon-name> by the presence of dorsal eyes.
                        <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex burnupi </tp:taxon-name> is similar in
                  appearance to <tp:taxon-name> P. luteus </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> P.
                        applanatus </tp:taxon-name> , but lacks distinctly raised dorsal papillae.
                  Its dorsal surface can even be smooth. It is difficult to distinguish
                        <tp:taxon-name> P. burnupi </tp:taxon-name> from <tp:taxon-name> P.
                        coriaceus </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> P. tigrinus </tp:taxon-name>
                  due to their similar coloration and granular dorsal appearance. Although
                  individuals of <tp:taxon-name> P. burnupi </tp:taxon-name> tend to be shorter than
                  those of <tp:taxon-name> P. coriaceus </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> P.
                        tigrinus </tp:taxon-name> , animal sizes overlap and cannot be used for
                  identification. </p>

                  </tp:taxon-name> and some specimens (with intestinal loops of type I) of
                        <tp:taxon-name> P. luteus </tp:taxon-name> . The reproductive system can be
                  used to distinguish <tp:taxon-name> P.burnupi </tp:taxon-name> from all other
                  species of <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex </tp:taxon-name> . The deferent duct in the
                  posterior reproductive system is loosely attached to the oviduct in
                        <tp:taxon-name> P. burnupi </tp:taxon-name> , which distinguishes it from
                        <tp:taxon-name> P. coriaceus </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> P.
                        tigrinus </tp:taxon-name> (deferent duct closely attached to the oviduct).
                  The distal region of the penis with penial hooks is also much shorter in
                        <tp:taxon-name> P. burnupi </tp:taxon-name> ( 1–1.2 mm ) than in
                        <tp:taxon-name> P. coriaceus </tp:taxon-name> ( 2–8 mm ). <tp:taxon-name>
                        Platevindex burnupi </tp:taxon-name> is very difficult to differentiate from
                        <tp:taxon-name> P. luteus </tp:taxon-name> internally. They differ only
                  slightly with respect to the insertion of the penial retractor muscle (near the
                  heart in <tp:taxon-name> P. luteus </tp:taxon-name> and in the last posterior
                  quarter of the visceral cavity in <tp:taxon-name> P. burnupi </tp:taxon-name> ).
                  DNA sequences are the most reliable way to distinguish <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex
                        burnupi </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> P. luteus </tp:taxon-name> ,
                  which are more than 10.5% divergent based on COI sequences. </p>

            <p> Like other species of <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex </tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>
                        P. burnupi </tp:taxon-name> is found on mangrove trees but, unlike other
                  species, it may also be found on mud. Specimens in Madagascar were found high in
                  the intertidal on moist mud not saturated in water, and one specimen was found on
                  a piece of wood. A specimen from Mozambique was collected on the base of a
                        <tp:taxon-name> Ceriops </tp:taxon-name> tree, 30 cm above ground. All
                  specimens in South Africa were on mud, in the supra-tidal zone of a salt marsh, a
                  few meters away from the river. </p>

            <p> Remarks </p>
            <p>
                  <tp:taxon-name> Onchidium burnupi </tp:taxon-name> must be transferred to
                        <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex </tp:taxon-name> because of the following
                  combination of characters in the lectotype : flattened body, rectal gland present
                  and no penial gland. The type locality (Umlaas Lagoon, Natal, South Africa ) was
                  visited twice by our team and several times by experts from the Natal Museum (Dai
                  Herbert, pers. com.), but no onchidiid species were ever found. This is very
                  likely due to the fact that the Umlaas Lagoon has been developed and natural
                  vegetation destroyed. However, onchidiids similar to the lectotype of
                        <tp:taxon-name> O. burnupi </tp:taxon-name> were recently collected by Mary
                  Cole and Philippe Bouchet in the estuary of the Kwelera River, East Cape , South
                  Africa (approximately 400 km south of the type locality). As of today, no other
                  live population of <tp:taxon-name> P. burnupi </tp:taxon-name> is known in South
                  Africa (assuming that there is no live population at the type locality). Note that

            <p> description, i.e., without providing new specimens or records ( Connolly 1912 , 1939

            <p>
                  <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex burnupi </tp:taxon-name> is known from two localities
                  in South Africa , three localities in Madagascar and one locality in Mozambique .
                  High genetic divergences between populations from Madagascar and Mozambique versus
                  South Africa (5.4–6.0%) as well as the fact that they are consistently recovered
                  as reciprocally-monophyletic units ( Figs 4–8 ) suggest that there could be more
                  than one species. However, there is not enough evidence to justify the description
                  of a new species in Madagascar . The anatomy of populations from South Africa and
                  Madagascar are similar, and little is known about intraspecific variation across
                  its distribution. The genetic divergences between Madagascar and East Africa (
                  Mozambique and South Africa ) could be the result of the large geographic distance
                  between localities. However, there are some noticeable differences between the
                  populations in the two regions. </p>

                  </tp:taxon-name> comb. nov. A . Madagascar, near Mangaoka (station 160). B–D .
                  Madagascar, Ambaro Bay, vegetation and close view of the high intertidal mud
                  (station 164). E–F . South Africa, East Cape, Kwelera Estuary, estuarine plants in
                  the supra-tidal fringe of salt marsh. </p>
            <p> The most noticeable difference between regions is animal length: individuals
                  collected from South Africa (up to 32 mm ) are significantly larger than those
                  from Madagascar (up to 16 mm ) and Mozambique ( 13 mm ). However, intermediate
                  sizes may be found when additional populations are discovered, or this could be
                  due to a difference in climate. The deferent duct in the posterior (female)
                  reproductive system is slightly longer in specimens from Madagascar than in
                  specimens from South Africa (even though animal size is larger in South Africa ),
                  but this could also be the result of population structure (this trait is known to
                  vary between individuals). In addition, the insertion of the retractor muscle is
                  more posterior in specimens from Madagascar than in South Africa . Finally,
                  Madagascan individuals were found in a different habitat (mangrove) than in South
                  Africa (salt marsh). Salt marshes in Madagascar were not visited for this study
                  and may need to be explored in the future. </p>
