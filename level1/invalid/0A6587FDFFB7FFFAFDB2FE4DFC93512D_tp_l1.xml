      <p> Diagnosis </p>
      <p>Rostral without free edges, slightly elongated towards the back interceding between
         internasals; 8 supralabials, generally fourth and fifth touching the lower edge of the eye;
         10 infralabials; preocular divided; a single loreal; prenasal may or may not be in contact
         with the second supralabial; a second pair of chinshields in contact with each other or
         sometimes separated by a row of scales;175–209 ventrals; 82–108 subcaudals; tail length 22
         to 29% of the total length; maxillary teeth normally 9+3. Color pattern consists of a pale
         vertebral line three scales wide that begins on the neck and tapers to one scale wide on
         the last third of body; two pairs of dark longitudinal lines, dorsolateral lines two to
         four scales wide not touching the temporal region and connecting on the anterior part,
         forming a patch that separates them from the parietal region; lateral lines involving the
         third row of dorsal scales and may or may not be interrupted by an irregular pattern of
         patches in the posterior region of head.</p>
      <p>This species differs from its congeners by having a single loreal, edges of rostral scale
         not free, maxillary teeth 9 +3, and a pale vertebral line that extends to the neck without
         touching the temporal region.</p>

      <p> Distribution and conservation </p>
      <p> Endemic to Mexico ; distributed from Sonora and Chihuahua southward through the states of
         Sinaloa , Durango , Zacatecas , Nayarit , Jalisco ; in central Mexico through the
         Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the states of Querétaro , Guanajuato , Michoacán , Guerrero
         , Estado de México , Hidalgo , Morelos , Puebla , and Veracruz ( Fig. 5 ). </p>
      <p>Within its distribution, it is found in at least four protected natural areas. Mexican
         legislation has listed this species as subject to Special Protection and the IUCN has it
         listed as a species of Least Concern.</p>

      <p> Remarks </p>
      <p> The holotype of <tp:taxon-name> S. bogerti </tp:taxon-name> is a juvenile purportedly
         collected by F. Sumichrast in the vicinity of “Tehuantepec”; this locality does not appear
         to be the usual collecting site of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca , but rather a community in the
         municipality of San Andrés Tuxtla called Tehuantepec (from the notes of C.M. Bogert;
         Pérez-Higareda &amp; Smith 1991 ). Independently of this, the morphological characteristics
         of the holotype of <tp:taxon-name> bogerti </tp:taxon-name> correspond with the
         morphological characteristics of a population of specimens of <tp:taxon-name> Salvadora
            bairdi </tp:taxon-name> collected in the state of Veracruz , near Cordoba. It is worth
         mentioning that <tp:taxon-name> Salvadora bairdi </tp:taxon-name> is the species that
         varies the most in squamation and coloration patterns. After an extensive review of the
         literature and after many years of collecting (either personal or by other collectors) in
         the region of Los Tuxtlas, no more specimens have come to light, and it is apparent that
         the holotype of <tp:taxon-name> S. bogerti </tp:taxon-name> may have been a mislabeled
         specimen. Pérez-Higareda et al . (2007) do not list this species as part of the
         ophidiofauna of the region; therefore, we conclude that the locality of the type of
            <tp:taxon-name> Salvadora bogerti </tp:taxon-name> is not from Los Tuxtlas and more
         likely was collected by Sumichrast near Orizaba; a locality where he lived and made
         collections. </p>

         </tp:taxon-name> . </p>
      <p> Some individuals in northern Sinaloa , southern Sonora and Chihuahua have a series of
         patches or transverse patches on the first third of body; however, in spite of being an
         isolated population, this character is not constant in the specimens we examined. </p>
