      <p> Etymology </p>
      <p> The genus name is compound by the Greek ψευδής [pseudes] (‘misleading’, ‘deceiving’) and
         the genus name <tp:taxon-name> Polyascophorus </tp:taxon-name> , indicating an ostensible
         morphological similarity of <tp:taxon-name> Polyascophorus </tp:taxon-name> and

      <p> Member of <tp:taxon-name>Cletodidae T. Scott, 1904</tp:taxon-name> ,
            <tp:taxon-name>Cletodinae T. Scott</tp:taxon-name> , 1904 and the <tp:taxon-name>
            Ceratonotus </tp:taxon-name> group sensu Conroy- Dalton (2001). Body more or less
         cylindrical, tapering slightly posteriorly, without clear demarcation between pro- and
         urosoma. Sexual dimorphism in A1, P3, P4, P5, and P6; females with GDS due to fusion of
         last (P6-bearing) thoracic and first abdominal (genital) somite. Cphth comprising
         approximately ¼ of body length; rostrum fused to cephalothorax, enlarged and Y-shaped; with
         long tube pore but no rostral setulose tuft (RST). Cphth with paired knobbed frontolateral
         horns (FLH), cephalothoracic posterior lateroventral (CLVPp) and laterodorsal processes
         (CLDPp); CLVPp bifurcated. Thoracic somites bearing P2–P5 with dorsal cuticular processes
         DP1–DP4. First abdominal somite (= posterior part of female GDS) with single centred DP5.
         Cphth, body somites, and furca with tube pores dorsally and/or laterally. Furcal rami
         barely 4 times as long as broad, rounded at their apical outer margin; with 7 setae
         (I–VII). Female A1 4-segmented, with first segment elongated and bearing long spinules on
         inner margin, and with aesthetasc on third and fourth segment. Male A1 6-segmented,
         subchirocer. A2 with allobasis, without endopod; allobasis with 2 abexopodal setae. Endopod
         as long as allobasis, with 2 spinulose frills (sub)apically. P1 with 2-segmented exopod;
         exp-1 with 1 bipinnate outer spine, exp- 2 with 4 apical, geniculate setae and 1 outer
         spine; endopod 2-segmented in female, with 1 apical seta, absent in male. P2–P4 with
         3-segmented exopods; exp-1 with 1 outer spine, exp-2 with 1 outer spine and 1 inner seta;
         exp-3 with 2 outer spines and 2 apical setae, and with 1 (P2, P4) or 2 (P3) inner setae. P2
         without endopod. P3 endopod in female 2-segmented, carrying 2 apical setae; in male
         3-segmented with a small bare enp-1, elongated enp-2 with a curved apophysis on inner
         apical margin, and 2 apical setae on small enp-3. P4 endopod 2-segmented; enp-1 small,
         unarmed, enp- 2 in female with 1 apical seta; in male with 2 apical setae and 1 outer
         spine. P5 with baseoendopod and exopod fused, sexually dimorphic; endopodal lobe completely
         reduced and represented by 1 seta and 1 tube pore in female, and by 2 setae and 2 tube
         pores in male. Female genital field with gonopore covered by genital operculum formed by
         the reduced P6, with 1 seta on each side. </p>
