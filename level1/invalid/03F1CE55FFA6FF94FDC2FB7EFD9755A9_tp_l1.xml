resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
X. caraboides

33.4 mm

vs about 
37 mm

X. schoenitzeri
</tp:taxon-name>
by: anteocular part 1.45 times as long as postocular part (vs 1.7 times in

in the shape of the head and the moderately inflated labial segment III.

      <p>
Moreover, several additional characters can also distinguish 
<tp:taxon-name>
X. attractivus
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
from its congeners: the blackish brown body color (vs brown in other species); the ~90° erected scutellum (vs ~45° suberected scutellum in other species); apex of fore wing reaching middle of scutellum (vs surpassing middle but not reaching apex of scutellum in other species). Species of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>

can be distinguished with the key above.
