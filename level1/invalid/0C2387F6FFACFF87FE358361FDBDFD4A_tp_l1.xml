The subfamily and its constituent tribes and subtribes were diagnosed by 
Hollis &amp; Broomfield (1989)
(treated as family, subfamilies and tribes) who also analysed the generic relationships of the family using morphological evidence; the three subfamilies (here tribes) were represented in a trifurcation in their cladogram. The molecular analyses, in which only three genera were included, reflect this morphological tree but sampled only two subfamilies (here tribes). Following 
Ouvrard (2002)
, the classification of 
Burckhardt &amp; Ouvrard (2012)
differs from that of 
Hollis &amp; Broomfield (1989)
in the inclusion of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phytolyma

Scott, 
1882
</tp:taxon-name>
in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Macrohomotominae 
White &amp; Hodkinson, 1985
</tp:taxon-name>
(Phytolymini) rather than in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Aphalarinae</tp:taxon-name>
. The classification presented here reflects that of 
Burckhardt &amp; Ouvrard (2012)
though with reduced ranks.
