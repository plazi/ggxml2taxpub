The two new species described below are tentatively placed in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Scotophaeus
</tp:taxon-name>
due to the absence of males and the general taxonomic uncertainty surrounding this genus. According to 
Levy (1999: 437)
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Scotophaeus
</tp:taxon-name>
is a “cumulative taxon for medium-sized robust gnaphosids”, a problem that has not been resolved; the genus requires a full revision (
Murphy 2007: 51
). However, the similarity of most of the somatic characters of the new species with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Scotophaeus
</tp:taxon-name>
(e.g., habitus, shape of maxillae, cheliceral dentition, eye configuration [as illustrated in 
Murphy 2007
: fig. 374], presence of scopulae on metatarsi I and II [a diagnostic character of the genus, according to 
Levy 1999: 437
]) as well as the form of the genital organs, with a wide epigynal depression and multi-chambered receptacles, indicate that this genus is the best candidate for generic assignment.
