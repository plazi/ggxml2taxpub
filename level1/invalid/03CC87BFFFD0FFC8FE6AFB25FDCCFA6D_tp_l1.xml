with conch reaching

dm. Subadult stage with weakly trapezoidal, moderately depressed whorl profile (ww/wh =1.50–1.80) and broadly rounded venter; 10–13 coarse conical nodes on midflank per volution. Adult stage with numerous weak ribs and small ventrolateral nodes. Prongs of external lobe bifid or trifid; altogether 15–20 notches of E, A and L lobes.

Etymology
</p>
      <p>
From the Latin ‘ 
brevis
’, meaning ‘low’ and ‘ 
sella
’, meaning ‘saddle’, after the low amplitude of lobes and saddles in the suture line.

Description
</p>
      <p>
The large 
paratype
MB.C.29746 has 
125 mm
conch diameter, of which half of the last whorl belongs to the strongly weathered body chamber (
Fig. 23A
). The phragmocone is 
90 mm
in diameter and is partly crushed; it shows that the whorl profile is trapezoidal with a broadly rounded venter. The sculpture changes dramatically throughout ontogeny. At 
40 mm
dm there are 13 coarse, spiny ventrolateral nodes per volution; these nodes become weaker and more numerous so that the last 120° of the phragmocone have about 20 weak ventrolateral nodes, which are connected with weak and slightly sinuous radial ribs on the flank. The suture line of the specimen suffered from weathering, but, most probably, the prongs of the very short external lobe are bifid.
</p>
      <p>
Holotype
MB.C.29748 is a fairly well-preserved, fully septate specimen with 
51 mm
conch diameter (
Fig. 23B
). It has a weakly trapezoidal whorl profile with broadly rounded flanks and venter. The sculpture shows about ten coarse conical nodes, which are positioned on the midflank, on the last preserved volution.
</p>
      <p>
The suture line of the 
holotype
shows an external lobe with subparallel, weakly diverging flanks and weakly asymmetric, trifid prongs. All three saddles of the outer suture line are similar in shape, being inverted U-shaped and broadly rounded. The adventive lobe and the lateral lobe are similar in shape with parallel flanks and many small notches at the base. They differ in their depth; the adventive lobe is much deeper than the external lobe (
Fig. 23C
).

Remarks

      <p>
Among the species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dzhulfites
</tp:taxon-name>
, only 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. nodosus
</tp:taxon-name>
is similar in conch shape and sculpture, but this species shows an applanate venter in the adult stage. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dzhulfites brevisellatus
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. spinosus
</tp:taxon-name>
and the other species of the genus in the suture line, which in 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. brevisellatus
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
shows much wider elements; particularly the saddles are wider than the lobes. In the shape of the suture line, 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. brevisellatus
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
has some resemblance to representatives of the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Xenodiscidae</tp:taxon-name>
.
