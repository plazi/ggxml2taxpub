Description
</p>
      <p>
CARAPACE. Corners of anterior carapace margin extending ventrally in wide, roundish boss (
Fig. 151A
); curved carina between ocular triads and carapace margin, and straight carina anterior to lateral eyes; six short, narrow anterior setae; frontal process rectangular. Small granules densely scattered between ocular triads and among sulci. Median eyes and median ocular tubercle well developed; pair of setae on median ocular tubercle; lateral eyes well developed, seta posterior to lateral ocular triad; lateral ocular triad situated near carapace margin.
</p>
      <p>
STERNUM. Tritosternum projected anteriorly with pair of prominent setae near anterior pair of setae, long, surpassing base of pedipalp coxae (
Fig. 151B
); other sternal platelets narrow and concave, with pair of setae anteriorly and some smaller setae posteriorly; pentasternum with four setae anteriorly and without seta near membranous region.
</p>
      <p>OPISTHOSOMA. Ventral sacs and short ventral sac cover present.</p>
      <p>
GENITALIA. Female genital operculum with small projection and short setae posteromedially; median region flat; gonopod short, broad, tubular, and markedly sclerotized basally. Male genitalia with distal border of fistula and base of lateral lobe markedly sclerotized; lateral lobe 2 fimbriate, with short projections (
Fig. 152A–B, D
).
</p>
      <p>CHELICERAE. Short projection on retrolateral surface of basal segment, opposite to bifid tooth; retrolateral surface of claw with row of setae basally to medially; claw with six teeth; more than two rows of 16 setae on prolateral surface of basal segment; bifid tooth on basal segment with dorsal cusp larger than ventral cusp.</p>
      <p>
PEDIPALPS. Coxal dorsal carina with three setae on anterior margin and with seta encircled by round carina. Trochanter with long, swollen seta near apex of ventral apophysis. Femur with four dorsal spines and four or five ventral spines; males with small spine between spines 2 and 3, and spines 3 and 4; two dorsal spines and prominent setiferous tubercle between spine 1 and proximal margin; short ventral spine between spines 1 and 2 (
Fig. 151E–F
); long ventral spine between spine 1 and proximal margin. Patella with five dorsal spines; short spine between spines 3 and 4; prominent spine distal to spine I, half length of spine I; three or four ventral spines; small spine between each spine of primary series; long, straight spine between spine I and distal margin. Tibia with ventral spine distally and seta between spine and distal margin. Tarsus with three short, equal dorsal spines; short seta near base of cleaning organ (
Fig. 151C
); ventral row of cleaning organ with 24–30 setae in ventral row.
</p>
      <p>
LEGS. Tibia of leg I with 25 articles (28 on regenerated legs); tarsus I with 45 articles (48 on regenerated legs); first tarsal article similar in length to subsequent article; rod sensilla with multiple setae (
Fig. 153A– B
). Leg IV basitibia with four pseudo-articles, with sclerotized, denticulate margin projecting from apex of articles; trichobothrium 
bt
situated in distal third of pseudo-article; distitibia trichobothrium 
bc
situated closer to 
sbf
than to 
bf
, 
sc
and
