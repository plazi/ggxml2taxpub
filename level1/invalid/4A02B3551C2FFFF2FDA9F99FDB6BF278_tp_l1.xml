Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
The new genus differs from all other genera of the tribe 
<tp:taxon-name>Monophlebini</tp:taxon-name>
in the presence of lanceolate conical setae, densely covering the body and in the presence of the discoidal wax glands with stalked centre.
</p>
      <p>
Morphologically, the new genus seems to be the most similar to the Palaearctic 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pseudaspidoproctus
Morrison, 1927
</tp:taxon-name>
and Nearctic 
<tp:taxon-name>
Llaveiella

Morrison,

in the presence of numerous conical setae (see the figure and the key for genera in 
Gavrilov-Zimin 2018: 154
, 158).

Description
</p>
      <p>
Adult female
</p>
      <p>
Body broadly oval, covered by solid wax plates (
Fig. 1
). Antennae 9-segmented. Legs normally developed; claw without denticle; claw digitules short, setose. Mouthparts well developed. Abdominal spiracles numbering 7 pairs; each abdominal spiracle with unilocular atrium, without wax pores inside or just near spiracular atrium. Anal apparatus represented by a short tube with internal sclerotized anal ring. Fifteen round cicatrices forming semicircle on abdominal sternites. Wax glands represented by four main 
types
of discoidal wax glands: 1) variable pores with stalked centre; 2) usual multilocular pores with round or oval central loculus and 10–12 peripheral loculi; 3) irregular multilocular pores with multiform central loculus and 6-10 peripheral loculi; 4) simple pores. Conical setae very numerous, with more or less lanceolate apices. Flagellate setae of different size and thickness numerous.
