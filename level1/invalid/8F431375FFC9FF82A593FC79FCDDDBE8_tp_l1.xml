</p>
      <p>
CARAPACE. Four anterior setae (

); frontal process triangular, not visible in dorsal view (
Fig. 42C
). Small granules densely scattered between ocular triads and among sulci. Median eyes and median ocular tubercle absent (
Fig. 42C
); pair of setae in place of median eyes; lateral eyes reduced, pale, seta posterior to lateral ocular triad.
</p>
      <p>
STERNUM. Tritosternum projected anteriorly, with typical setation (
Fig. 42B
); other sternal platelets divided into two, with acuminate setae anteriorly on each platelet and some smaller setae posteriorly (
Fig. 42B
); pentasternum with six setae anteriorly and two setae near membranous region.
</p>
      <p>OPISTHOSOMA. Ventral sacs and ventral sac cover absent.</p>
      <p>

Tibia with ventral spine distally and four setae between spine and distal margin. Tarsus with two dorsal spines, distal spine half length of tarsus and proximal spine one-third length of distal spine (

</p>
      <p>
LEGS. Leg IV basitibia with two pseudo-articles, without sclerotized, denticulate margin at apex of articles; trichobothrium

Armas

recorded several juveniles and/or poorly preserved specimens of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Charinus
</tp:taxon-name>
from different localities in 
Colombia
and provided photographs of the first charinid specimens recorded from the country. 

Armas 
et al.
(2012)

could not precisely identify the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Charinus
species
</tp:taxon-name>
due to the poor preservation of the material, and suggested the specimens resembled 

<tp:taxon-name>C. acosta</tp:taxon-name>
.

The specimen from the 
Sucre Department
was excluded from the map because a precise locality was unavailable. However, 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rocamadre
</tp:taxon-name>
is also known from Sucre and differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. acosta
</tp:taxon-name>
in the development of the median eyes, which are absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rocamadre
