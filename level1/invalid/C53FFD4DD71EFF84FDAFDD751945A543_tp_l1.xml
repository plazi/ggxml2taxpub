      <tp:treatment-sec sec-type="diagnosis">
            <p> Historical diagnosis </p>
            <p> (From Osborn 1900 ): “Large upper premolars, simple, unlike molars, with
                  incompletely formed crests; upper molars with internal cingulum and strong
                  protoconule [= paracone] fold, small antecrochet, no crochet; depression in
                  posterior face of metaloph of third molar; third and fourth lower premolars with
                  depressed and incomplete posterior crests. Measurements: P2–M3=224.” </p>
            <p> However, this diagnosis could refer to several species of <tp:taxon-name>
                        Ronzotherium </tp:taxon-name> since these characters are mostly
                  synapomorphies of the genus. Therefore, we emend the diagnosis based on the type
                  specimens from the Phosphorites du Quercy. Other emended diagnoses were provided
                  by Heissig (1969) and Brunet (1979) , but they were not only based on the type
                  material, but also on referred material from other localities. We emend here the
                  diagnosis based on our phylogenetic analysis. </p>
            <p> Emended diagnosis </p>
            <p>The coronoid process of the mandible is rather weak. The upper premolars are large,
                  simple, nonmolariform, with incompletely formed protoloph and metaloph, and labial
                  cingulum always present; P2 molariform, protocone and hypocone usually fused on
                  P3–4, strong, simple and continuous lingual cingulum, usually without ridges;
                  crista sometimes present on P3; metaloph of P2–4 discontinuous; upper molars with
                  strong and continuous lingual cingulum except under the hypocone of M1, almost no
                  labial cingulum, small antecrochet, no crochet, and a posterior groove on the
                  ectometaloph of M3; lower cheek teeth with strong and continuous labial cingulum
                  and lingual cingulum in the opening of the posterior valley; d/p1 usually present
                  and two-rooted, the paraconid of p2 is developed; the magnum facet of the McII is
                  straight; high proximal articulation of the fibula with the tibia; the expansion
                  of the calcaneus facet is wide and low on the astragalus; proximal border of the
                  anterior side of the MtIII straight and intermediate reliefs of the metapodials
                  low and smooth.</p>
            <p> It differs from <tp:taxon-name> R. velaunum </tp:taxon-name> by the deep median
                  constriction of the distal humeral articulation and from <tp:taxon-name> R.
                        elongatum </tp:taxon-name> by its close frontoparietal crests, its straight
                  occipital crest and its poorly developed processus posttympanicus and its
                  constricted metaloph on P3–4 (hypocone not connected to the ectoloph). </p>
            <p> It further differs from <tp:taxon-name> R. elongatum </tp:taxon-name> and
                        <tp:taxon-name> R. romani </tp:taxon-name> by its sharp angle at the
                  anterior tip of the zygomatic process and the higher posterior side of the

            <p> Description </p>
            <p> MAXILLA. The right and left maxillae of the holotype MNHN.F.QU7232 are well
                  preserved, and bear P2–M3 on both sides ( Fig. 11 ). The anterior border of the
                  choanae opens approximately at the level of M2 and the palatine foramen is at the
                  level of the anterior border of M3. The infraorbital foramen (still preserved via
                  the infraorbital canal) is located above the anterior border of P4. The anterior
                  border of the orbit is between M2 and M1. The zygomatic arches are broken but the
                  anterior border was above M2 and was high above the teeth neck. The retromolar
                  space behind M3 is short. </p>
            <p> Fig. 12. <tp:taxon-name> Ronzotherium filholi ( Osborn, 1900 ) </tp:taxon-name> from

                  Scale bar: 2 cm. </p>
            <p> MANDIBLES. The paratype hemimandibles MNHN.F.QU7202 and MNHN.F.QU7201 are
                  incomplete, the symphysis and the two rami are not preserved ( Fig. 12 ). The
                  foramen mentale was anterior to p3. The base of the corpus mandibulae is straight
                  and the lingual groove is present, though extremely shallow, and barely visible.
                  The foramen mandibulare is located below the teeth neck line. Because of the
                  fragmentary condition of the specimen, no other characters can be observed. From
                  another mandible from Quercy (MNHN.F.QU17193), we can observe that the posterior
                  border of the mandible and the foramen mentale were both located at the level of
                  p2, lingually and labially. </p>
            <p> UPPER DENTITION. The cheek teeth have no cement and the crown is low ( Fig. 11 ).
                  The LP3–4/LM1–2 ratio is equal to 0.51, i.e., the premolar row is long compared to
                  the molar row. </p>
            <p> The first premolar is not preserved on the holotype MNHN.F.QU7232. Only one P1 was
                  found among the numerous isolated teeth of <tp:taxon-name> Ronzotherium
                  </tp:taxon-name> from Quercy in the MNHN collection, on a maxilla fragment with P2
                  (MNHN.F.QU16445). It has three roots, two labial and a lingual one. The paracone
                  is the largest cusp, and the paracone and metacone folds are strong. The protocone
                  is extremely weak, and fuses with the strong and continuous lingual cingulum. The
                  protocone connects lingually to the hypocone by a small bridge. The protoloph is
                  very weak and does not fully connect to the paracone. The metaloph is complete and
                  connects the well-developed hypocone to the metacone. The parastyle is weak. The
                  anterolingual cingulum is present. The labial cingulum is strong under the
                  parastyle and the metacone but absent under the paracone. </p>
            <p> All upper premolars (P2–4) on the holotype have a very strong and continuous lingual
                  cingulum, which extends anteriorly and posteriorly. The labial cingulum is only
                  present under the parastyle and metastyle, and completely absent under the
                  paracone and metacone. The paracone fold is rather strong and the metacone fold is
                  weak. There is no constriction of the protocone. They have no crista, crochet or
                  antecrochet and the postfossette is narrow. They all bear three roots. </p>
            <p>The protocone and hypocone of P2 are equal and connected by a low lingual bridge. The
                  protoloph is weak and directed towards the parastyle, not the paracone, and does
                  not fully connect to the ectoloph. The metaloph is continuous and
                  postero-lingually directed.</p>
            <p>On P3, the hypocone is very weak and very poorly differentiated from the protocone by
                  a shallow lingual groove. The protoloph is straight, connected to the parastyle
                  and well developed. The metaloph is thinner, transverse and S-shaped.</p>
            <p>The protocone and hypocone of P4 are completely fused, and the protoloph is L-shaped.
                  The metaloph is very weak and it is completely separated from the
                  protocone/hypocone. It is S-shaped, short and connects to the ectoloph between the
                  paracone and the metacone.</p>
            <p>Upper molars have four roots. The lingual cingulum is strong and continuous, except
                  under the hypocone of M1, where it is completely fainted. The labial cingulum is
                  almost completely absent except for a few traces either under the parastyle or the
                  metastyle. The paracone fold is strong and the metacone fold is absent. There is a
                  broad and weak mesostyle on the ectoloph of M1. The crochet, crista and
                  medifossette are completely absent and there is no protocone constriction. The
                  posterior part of the ectoloph is straight.</p>
            <p>The M1 is square. The antecrochet is broad and distinguished by a postero-lingual
                  groove on the protoloph. The postfossette is very short and shallow. The metaloph
                  and protoloph are transverse. The posterior cingulum is high and continuous.</p>
            <p>The M2 differs from M1 by its larger size, the more oblique lophs, a shorter
                  metaloph, and the metacone more lingual. There is no lingual groove of the
                  protocone. The mesostyle is very weak and disappears at the base of the crown.</p>
            <p>The M3 is quadrangular but bears no metacone. The metaloph and ectoloph are fused
                  into an ectometaloph. The protocone is not constricted and the protoloph is
                  transverse. The posterior groove on the ectometaloph is present.</p>
            <p> LOWER DENTITION. The p1, p2 and anterior dentition are unknown from the paratypes
                  MNHN.F.QU7202 and MNHN.F.QU7201, and from the other mandibles from Quercy ( Fig.
                  12 ). </p>
            <p>Other lower cheek teeth (p3–m3) are double-rooted, low-crowned, and have no cement.
                  The labial cingulum is strong and almost completely continuous, it only vanishes
                  under the ectolophid groove and it is very weak overall on m1. The lingual
                  cingulum is present at the opening of the anterior and posterior valleys. The
                  ectolophid groove is developed until the neck. In occlusal view, the trigonid is
                  very angular and forms a right dihedron while the talonid is rounded. The
                  metaconid of p3 bears a weak anterior crest that is almost joining the anterior
                  branch of the paralophid. There are no vertical rugosities on p3. The talonid of
                  p3–4 is poorly developed and the entoconid is almost completely absent. The
                  hypolophid is very low and the posterior valley is U-shaped in lingual view. The
                  anterior valley opens much higher above the neck than the posterior one. The
                  metaconid of premolars is very large and slightly constricted. The anterior branch
                  of the paralophid is long on molars and premolars. The entoconid of molars is
                  strongly developed and slightly constricted.</p>
            <p> POSTCRANIALS. The postcranial remains from the Quercy collection can only be hardly
                  associated with the cranial remains for several reasons. First, almost all
                  specimens belong to ‘old’ collections, i.e., the exact localities were not
                  specified, and specimens were mixed together and could belong to several loci.
                  Furthermore, the Quercy localities range in age from the early Eocene to the early
                  Miocene, and thus cannot be precisely dated. Therefore, only a few well-preserved
                  postcranial remains are tentatively attributed to? <tp:taxon-name> R. filholi
                  </tp:taxon-name> and described here. </p>
            <p> SCAPHOID. The scaphoid NMB-QV-275 is very well preserved, except for the distal part
                  of the anterior apophysis, which is partly broken ( Fig. 13A–D ). The posterior
                  height is slightly reduced compared to the anterior. The proximal articulation for
                  the radius is large, and very concave anteroposteriorly. It is lozenge-shaped in
                  proximal view, and very developed laterally. Below and anterior to this proximal
                  facet is the thin and elongated anteroproximal facet for the lunate, which is
                  completely fused to the posteroproximal one. The anteroproximal one is horizontal
                  while the posterior is oblique. The anterodistal facet for the lunate is separated
                  from the proximal ones by a wide groove. This facet is long and low, but hardly
                  distinguishable from the distal magnum facet just below. This distal facet for the
                  magnum is very concave in lateral view and separated from the large medio-distal
                  facet for the trapezoid by a high ridge. The latter is also very concave in
                  lateral view, but very convex mesio-laterally, and bears a large extension on the
                  medial side. The trapezium facet is not reduced and separated from the trapezoid
                  facet by a ridge. It is quite flat and oval-shaped. </p>
            <p> LUNATE. The lunate NMB-QE-440 is very poorly preserved and the posterior part is
                  broken ( Fig. 13E–I ). In anterior view, the distal border is very acute. Three
                  facets are visible in medial view, two small ones are for the scaphoid, while the
                  most distal one, for the magnum, is thin and elongated until the posterior border.
                  On the lateral side, the two facets for the pyramidal are separated by a deep
                  groove. The distal facet is larger than the proximal one. In distal view, the
                  unciform facet is large, almost rectangular and anteroposteriorly concave. </p>
            <p> PYRAMIDAL. The pyramidal NMB-QE-433 is perfectly preserved ( Fig. 13J–N ). The
                  proximal articulation for the ulna is very large, concave anteroposteriorly and
                  convex transversally. The postero-proximal facet for the pisiform is long and
                  drop-shaped. On the medial side, there are two large facets for the lunate,
                  separated by a deep groove. The distal one is symmetrical and slightly curved
                  towards the posterior side. In distal view, the facet for the unciform is
                  triangular and concave anteroposteriorly. </p>
            <p> MAGNUM. The magnum NMB-QE-472 is well preserved and complete ( Fig. 13O–S ). The
                  anterior side is pentagonal, and the proximal apophysis is very high. In anterior
                  view, the anterior border of the scaphoid facet is slightly concave while the
                  distal border is almost completely straight. On the lateral side, the lunate and
                  unciform facets are fused and form a unique L-shaped facet, occupying all the
                  anterolateral part of the proximal apophysis. Distally, it contacts the distal
                  facet for the McIII. This latter is very concave anteroposteriorly. The posterior
                  tuberosity is very short and curved. In medial view, the distal McII facet and the
                  medial facet for the trapezoid are almost in the same plane; they are only
                  distinguished by a very low ridge, and there is no indentation separating them.
                  The McII facet is flat. The trapezoid facet is large and widely connected to the
                  proximal magnum facet. </p>

            <p> CUBOID. The cuboid NMB-QE-362 is perfectly preserved ( Fig. 13T–X ). In proximal
                  view, the posterior apophysis is almost not visible. The proximal articulation is
                  oval-shaped, and the two surfaces for the astragalus and calcaneus are very poorly
                  distinguished. It is very concave anteroposteriorly and very high at the posterior
                  end. The proximal border of the anterior side is oblique, the distal one is
                  slightly convex while the medial and lateral borders are irregular and are crossed
                  by median grooves. The lateral one is much wider than the medial one and isolates
                  the posterior apophysis. On the medial side, the anterodistal facet for the
                  ectocuneiform is large and anteroposteriorly elongated. The postero-proximal facet
                  for the navicular is very large, concave and bears a thin anterior extension below
                  the proximal articulation. The small and rectangular posterior surface for the
                  ectocuneiform is located almost perpendicular to the postero-distal border of this
                  navicular surface. The distal articulation for the MtIV is a triangular-shaped
                  lozenge and is deeper than wide. </p>
