Adults are brown, sometimes yellowish gray, medium-sized crane flies with body length 4.0–9.0 mm. Antennal flagellum beaded. Mesonotal prescutum without tuberculate pits and pseudosutural foveae. Wing unpatterned or at most with darkening along cord, vein 
Sc
long and nearly reaching branching point of 
Rs
; 
sc-r
before base of 
Rs
; radial sector long and straight, situated very close to 
R
and nearly parallel to it; 

R

indistinct, slightly beyond fork of 
Rs
; discal cell open due to the atrophy of basal part of 

M

m-cu

M
; anal angle widely rounded. Male terminalia large with transverse ninth tergum, elongate gonocoxite bearing two terminal gonostyles, and straight and short aedeagus. Ovipositor elongate and sclerotized with strongly raised apex of cercus.
</p>
      <p>Larva depressed dorsoventrally. Head capsule heavily sclerotized, with complete hypostoma. Frons fused with internolateralia, which are considerably shorter than externolateralia.
