         <tp:taxon-name> Afrosmicronyx louwi </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. is mostly similar to
            <tp:taxon-name> A. madagascariensis Haran, 2018 </tp:taxon-name> . The two species can
         be distinguished by their size (body length 3.4–3.6 mm in <tp:taxon-name>A.
            madagascariensis</tp:taxon-name> , 2.5 mm in <tp:taxon-name> A. louwi </tp:taxon-name>
         sp. nov. ), the protibial tooth (moderately thickened in <tp:taxon-name> A. louwi
         </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. , strongly thickened tooth in <tp:taxon-name> A. madagascariensis
         </tp:taxon-name> ) and the shape of the penis (sides subparallel, thickened in middle in
         lateral view in <tp:taxon-name> A. louwi </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. , sides convex,
         thickness regular in lateral view in <tp:taxon-name> A. madagascariensis </tp:taxon-name>
