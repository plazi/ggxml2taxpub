Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
This species may be separated from other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Charinus
</tp:taxon-name>
in eastern South America by means of the following combination of characters: cheliceral claw with eleven teeth; pedipalp coxa with three long setae on margin, and two distinct setae encircled by round carina; pedipalp tarsus with two subequal dorsal spines (
Fig. 71C
); leg IV basitibia trichobothrium 
bt
situated proximal to submedial; distitibia trichobothrium 
bc
situated closer to 
sbf
than to

,

and

series each with six trichobothria.
</p>
      <p>
This species resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. imperialis
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
but possesses more spines on the pedipalp. One specimen (MNRJ 9098) exhibits a spine between dorsal spines 1 and 2 of the femur and a series of three or four small spines parallel to the primary series of dorsal spines, the first spine situated between spines 1 and 2, the second spine ventral to spine 2, and the third between spines 3 and 4. These spines vary in number and position in other individuals. The male is unknown.

Description
</p>
      <p>
CARAPACE. Six anterior setae (
Fig. 71A
); frontal process triangular. Small granules densely scattered between ocular triads and among sulci. Median eyes well developed (
Fig. 71A
); median ocular tubercle reduced, with pair of setae; lateral eyes well developed, seta posterior to lateral ocular triad; lateral ocular triad well separated from carapace margin.
</p>
      <p>
STERNUM. Tritosternum projected anteriorly with typical setation, long, surpassing base of pedipalp coxae (
Fig. 71B
); other sternal platelets narrow and concave, with pair of setae anteriorly on plaque and some smaller setae posteriorly; pentasternum with eleven setae anteriorly and three setae near membranous region.
</p>
      <p>OPISTHOSOMA. Ventral sacs and ventral sac cover absent.</p>
      <p>
GENITALIA. Female genital operculum with prominent setae posteromedially and some smaller setae near margin (
Fig. 72A–C
); gonopod sucker-like and slightly sclerotized basally (
Fig. 72A, D–E
); conical, without constriction (
Fig. 72A, D–E
); smooth surface between gonopods and distal border of gonopod (
Fig. 72B
). Male unknown.
</p>
      <p>CHELICERAE. Small tooth projecting from retrolateral surface of basal segment, opposite to bifid tooth; retrolateral surface of claw with continous row of setae, basally to medially; claw with eleven teeth; row of eighteen setae on prolateral surface of basal segment; bifid tooth on basal segment with dorsal cusp larger than ventral cusp.</p>
      <p>
PEDIPALPS. Coxal dorsal carina with two prominent setae encircled by round carina and three setae on margin. Femur with four dorsal spines and five ventral spines (
Fig. 71D
); spine between dorsal spines 2 and 3, and spines 3 and 4; four prominent setiferous tubercles between dorsal spine 1 and proximal margin; ventral spine between spine 1 and proximal margin (
Fig. 71E
); small spine ventral to extra spine proximal to spine 1, near articulation between femur and trochanter; spine between ventral spines 1 and 2, two spines between spines 2 and 3, and between spines 3 and 4. Patella with six dorsal spines in primary series (
Fig. 71E
); prominent setiferous tubercle distal to spine I, one-third length of spine I; four or five ventral spines (
Fig. 71F
); prominent setiferous tubercle between spine I and distal margin; small spine between spines 2 and 3. Tibia with ventral spine distally and four setae between spine and distal margin. Tarsus with two dorsal spines, distal spine twice as long as proximal spine (
Fig. 71C
); cleaning organ with 27–29 setae in ventral row.
