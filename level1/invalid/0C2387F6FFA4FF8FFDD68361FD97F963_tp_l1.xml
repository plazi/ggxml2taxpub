In both mtg trees, 
<tp:taxon-name>Aphalaridae</tp:taxon-name>
contains six strongly supported monophyla which we rank as subfamilies: 
<tp:taxon-name>Aphalarinae</tp:taxon-name>
, Microphyllurinae 
subfam. nov.
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Phacopteroninae 
Heslop-Harrison, 1958
</tp:taxon-name>
stat. nov., 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhinocolinae 
Vondráček, 1957
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Spondyliaspidinae Schwarz, 1898</tp:taxon-name>
and a clade of seven undescribed species from 
New Caledonia
representing an unnamed genus and subfamily. This last subfamily is not further treated here and will be described in another paper (Percy, unpublished). There is evidence (from multiple molecular analyses) that these six subfamilies are likely not collectively monophyletic, however, there is still insufficient data to clarify the phylogenetic placement of each monophyletic subfamily with respect to the others, and therefore, rather than recognize each as a separate family, we have retained them as subfamilies within 
<tp:taxon-name>Aphalaridae</tp:taxon-name>
“sensu lato” pending further analyses. In 
<tp:taxon-name>Aphalaridae</tp:taxon-name>
, we also place 
<tp:taxon-name>
Togepsyllinae 
Bekker-Migdisova, 1973
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cecidopsyllinae 
Li, 2011
</tp:taxon-name>
stat. nov. which were not included in the molecular analyses by 

Percy 
et al
. (2018)

but representatives were analysed by 

Cho 
et al
. (2019)

. A morphological character shared by all constituent subfamilies, and putative synapomorphy for the family, is the tarsal arolium of the immatures which is either completely absent or forms a lobe lacking an unguitractor (
Burckhardt &amp; Ouvrard 2012
).

Apart from strong support of the sister group relationship of 
<tp:taxon-name>Microphyllurinae</tp:taxon-name>
subfam. nov.
(as “ 
<tp:taxon-name>
Parapaurocephala
</tp:taxon-name>
” in 

Percy 
et al
. 2018

) and 
<tp:taxon-name>Phacopteroninae</tp:taxon-name>
stat. nov.
, there are no consistent and well-supported relationships between the subfamilies in the molecular analyses by 

Percy 
et al
. (2018)

. A putative morphological synapomorphy grouping the 
<tp:taxon-name>Rhinocolinae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Spondyliaspidinae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Togepsyllinae</tp:taxon-name>
is the tubercular or knob-like meracanthus rather than horn-shaped as in the other aphalarid subfamilies and most other 
<tp:taxon-name>Psylloidea</tp:taxon-name>
. 

Luo 
et al.
(2017)

listed some putative synapomorphies suggesting a close relationship of 
<tp:taxon-name>Rhinocolinae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Togepsyllinae</tp:taxon-name>
, a relationship which was also shown in 
Drohojowska’s (2015)
trees based on an analysis of the thorax morphology, and recovered in the molecular data set of 

Cho 
et al
. (2019)

.

         <tp:taxon-name>Aphalaridae</tp:taxon-name>
, in the present definition, differs from that of 
Burckhardt &amp; Ouvrard (2012)
in the positions of 
<tp:taxon-name>Cecidopsyllinae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Microphyllurinae</tp:taxon-name>
subfam. nov.
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Pachypsyllinae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Phacopteroninae</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cecidopsylla
Kieffer, 1905
</tp:taxon-name>
, was assigned to 
<tp:taxon-name>Calophyidae</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Mastigimatinae</tp:taxon-name>
) and is transferred here to 
<tp:taxon-name>Aphalaridae</tp:taxon-name>
(Cecidopsyllinae). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Microphyllurus
Li, 2002
</tp:taxon-name>
, the only member of 
<tp:taxon-name>Microphyllurinae</tp:taxon-name>
subfam. nov.
, was treated as a junior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Peripsyllopsis
Enderlein, 1926
</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Liviidae</tp:taxon-name>
: 
<tp:taxon-name>Euphyllurinae</tp:taxon-name>
: 
<tp:taxon-name>Diaphorinini</tp:taxon-name>
) by 
Burckhardt &amp; Ouvrard (2012)
, whereas the “‘ 
<tp:taxon-name>
Paurocephala
</tp:taxon-name>
’ 
<tp:taxon-name>
longicella
</tp:taxon-name>
group”, which we consider here a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Microphyllurus
</tp:taxon-name>
(see below), was referred to 
<tp:taxon-name>Aphalaridae</tp:taxon-name>
(
<tp:taxon-name>Rhinocolinae</tp:taxon-name>
). 
<tp:taxon-name>Pachypsyllinae</tp:taxon-name>
was part of 
<tp:taxon-name>Aphalaridae</tp:taxon-name>
and is transferred here to 
<tp:taxon-name>Carsidaridae</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>Phacopteroninae</tp:taxon-name>
was considered a family of basal position within 
<tp:taxon-name>Psylloidea</tp:taxon-name>
, and a basal position for 
<tp:taxon-name>Phacopteronidae</tp:taxon-name>
as sister to the remaining 
<tp:taxon-name>Psylloidea</tp:taxon-name>
was strongly supported in 

Cho 
et al
. (2019)

; this is one of the notable differences with analyses in 

Percy 
et al
. (2018)

. It may be that the different taxon sampling strategies were critical in determining these results, but here we have elected to adopt the placement using the more comprehensive taxon sampling in
