Description
</p>
      <p>
Female
</p>
      <p>
Small sized nematodes, 
0.44–0.55 mm
long; curved ventrad upon fixation; body cylindrical, tapering gradually towards both extremities but more so towards the anterior end. Cuticle with two distinct layers, 1.0–1.5 μm thick at midbody and 1.5–2 μm on tail. Outer cuticle finely striated; inner layer thick, with radial refractive elements. Lateral chords occupying about 23–31% of midbody diameter. Lateral, dorsal and ventral body pores indistinct. Lip region cap-like, offset by distinct constriction, 1.4–2.0 times as wide as high or about ⅓ of the body diameter at neck base. Lips rounded, amalgamated, inner part elevated, transformed into a labial disc-like structure. Amphids small, cup-shaped, their aperture occupying about ⅓ to 
2/5
of lip region diameter. Stoma a truncate cone. Odontostyle short, slender, anterior end slightly thick, 0.8–1.0 times the lip region diameter long, its aperture about 
1/5
to ⅓ of the odontostyle length. Odontophore rod-like, with minute basal knobs, 1.0–1.2 times the odontostyle length. Guiding ring simple, refractive, at 0.6–0.8 times lip region diameter from anterior end. Pharynx consisting of a slender, slightly muscular anterior part, expanding abruptly into a cylindrical basal bulb, with thick-walled lumen, occupying about 39–43% of total neck length. Pharyngeal gland nuclei and their orifices are located as follows: DO = 62–65, DN = 65–68, DN–DO = 1.9–3.4, S1N1 = 75–79, S1N2 = 79–82, S2N = 88–90, S2O = 90–92. Nerve ring located at 36–43% of neck length from anterior region. Cardia rounded to conoid, about ⅓ of the corresponding body diameter long.
</p>
      <p>
Genital system monodelphic-prodelphic. Ovary reflexed, measuring 32–86 μm long; oocytes arranged in single row except near tip. Oviduct joining the ovary subterminally, measuring 53–102 μm, with a welldeveloped pars dilatata. Oviduct-uterus junction marked by well-developed sphincter. Uterus slightly long and tubular, measuring 27–53 μm. Posterior genital branch reduced to simple sac, measuring 22–54 μm or 1.2–3.0 times midbody diameter. Sperm cell present throughout the genital tract. Vagina cylindrical, extending inwards, 8.0–10 μm or about ½ to 
3/5
(46–61%) of midbody diameter; pars proximalis vaginae 5.0–7.0 × 3.0–5.0 μm, encircled by circular muscles; pars distalis vaginae short, 2.0–3.0 μm with slightly curved walls; pars refringens absent. Vulva a transverse slit. Prerectum 3.4–6.6 and rectum 0.9–1.2 times anal body diameter long. Tail short, rounded to rounded-conoid, 0.6–0.9 times anal body diameter long, with a pair of subdorsal and a prominent terminal caudal pore present.
</p>
      <p>
Male
</p>
      <p>General morphology similar to that of female, except for posterior region being more ventrally curved. Genital system diorchic, testes opposed, sperm cell spindle-shaped. In addition to adcloacal pair at 4.0–5.0 µm from cloacal aperture, there are two ventromedian supplements, located outside the range of spicules, first one at 22–31 μm from adcloacal pair, second at 16–31 μm from first ventromedian supplement. Spicules typically dorylaimoid, curved ventrad, 4.3–5.1 times as long as wide and 1.3–1.5 times as long as body diameter at level of cloacal aperture, dorsal contour regularly convex, ventral contour bearing a moderately developed hump and hollow, curvature 125–130º, head occupying about 10–11% of total spicules length, median pieces 7.5–11.3 times as long as wide, occupying about 37– 57% of the spicules maximum width, reaching the spicules tip, posterior end 1.5–2.0 μm wide. Lateral guiding pieces distinct, rod-like, about 3.3–5.0 times as long as wide or about ¼ to ⅓ of the spicules length. Prerectum 5.1–7.9 and rectum 1.5–1.7 times cloacal body diameter long. Tail short, rounded to conoid, 0.7–1.0 times cloacal body diameter long; a pair of subdorsal and a prominent terminal caudal pore present.</p>
