Remarks

      <p>
This tribe was proposed for four genera (
<tp:taxon-name>
Liadoxyela
Martynov, 1937
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Kirghizoxyela
Rasnitsyn, 1966
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Anomoxyela
Rasnitsyn, 1966
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Lydoxyela
Rasnitsyn, 1966
</tp:taxon-name>
) and five species from Jurassic and Early Cretaceous of Siberia and Central Asia, based on a set of diagnostic characters including short 1m-cu (about half as long as 3-Cu) as distinguishing it from 
<tp:taxon-name>Xyelini Newman, 1834</tp:taxon-name>
, the only other tribe in subfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>
Xyelinae (
Rasnitsyn 1966
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. The next revision of 
<tp:taxon-name>Xyelidae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Symphyta</tp:taxon-name>
in general (
Rasnitsyn 1969
) added another diagnostic feature, 1-Rs not longer than 1-M. One more genus (
<tp:taxon-name>
Orthoxyela
Rasnitsyn, 1983
</tp:taxon-name>
) and two species from the Jurassic of Siberia have been added to the tribe since (
Rasnitsyn 1983
). Much later three further genera (
<tp:taxon-name>
Platyxyela

Wang 
et al.
, 2012

</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cathayxyela

Wang 
et al.
, 2014

</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aequixyela

Wang 
et al.
, 2014

</tp:taxon-name>
), each with one species from the Middle Jurassic of 
China
, have been added to the tribe, even though not without confusion (

Wang 
et al.
2012

, 
2014
). The first genus was described in 
<tp:taxon-name>Macroxyelinae Ashmead, 1898</tp:taxon-name>
but later listed under 
<tp:taxon-name>
Liadoxyelini 
Rasnitsyn, 1966
</tp:taxon-name>
(

Wang 
et al.
2014

: table 1). Judging from their descriptions and the table 1, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cathayxyela
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aequixyela
</tp:taxon-name>
were equally described as members of 
<tp:taxon-name>Liadoxyelini</tp:taxon-name>
, but this was under the title 
<tp:taxon-name>Xyelini</tp:taxon-name>
which we consider a lapsus calami. We agree with the interpretation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platyxyela
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cathayxyela
</tp:taxon-name>
as members of 
<tp:taxon-name>Liadoxyelini</tp:taxon-name>
. However, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aequixyela
</tp:taxon-name>
differs from other 
<tp:taxon-name>Liadoxyelini</tp:taxon-name>
considerably in having 1-Rs scarcely longer than 1-M, 1m-cu distinctly longer than half 3-Cu, pterostigma distinctly inflated (often in 
<tp:taxon-name>Xyelini</tp:taxon-name>
but never in 
<tp:taxon-name>Liadoxyelini</tp:taxon-name>
), and unlike all 
<tp:taxon-name>Xyelidae</tp:taxon-name>
, ovipositor very short and narrow. Unusual is also the very short antennal flagellum, only comparable with that in living 
<tp:taxon-name>Macroxyelini Ashmead, 1898</tp:taxon-name>
. The position of the latter genus needs special consideration: for the moment we consider it as 
<tp:taxon-name>Xyelinae</tp:taxon-name>
incertae tribus.
