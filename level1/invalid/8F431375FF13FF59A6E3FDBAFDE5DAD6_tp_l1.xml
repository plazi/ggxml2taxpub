Etymology
</p>
      <p>
Although the etymology of the species name was unspecified, ‘ 
<tp:taxon-name>
diblemma
</tp:taxon-name>
’ refers to the presence of two eyes, from the Latin ‘ 
di
-‘ (‘two’) and the Greek ‘ 
blemma
’ (‘glance’), as Simon (1936) considered this species to possess only the median pair.

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
The 
holotype
is small and very whitish, making it difficult to see details, and the opisthosoma is missing, but some characters could be observed. In the original description, Simon (1936) mentioned that 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. diblemma
</tp:taxon-name>
lacks lateral eyes, but small, whitish lateral eyes, were evident near the lateral margin of the carapace. The median eyes were also present. The sternum platelets were not yet formed. The cheliceral claw bears five teeth but it was impossible to observe teeth on the basal segment. Two dorsal spines and three ventral spines were evident on the pedipalp femur; three or four dorsal spines and two ventral spines were evident on the patella; and two dorsal spines on the tarsus. The tibia and tarsus of antenniform leg I comprise 21 and 37 articles, respectively. The basitibia of leg IV consists of three pseudo-articles.
</p>
      <p>
The immaturity and poor preservation of the 
holotype
renders it impossible to form an opinion regarding the taxonomic validity of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. diblemma
</tp:taxon-name>
until such time as adults can be collected from the vicinity of the type locality. 
Delle Cave (1986)
designated 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. diblemma
</tp:taxon-name>
as nomen dubium, not by 
Weygoldt (1994)
, as stated in 
Harvey (2003
, 
2013
).
