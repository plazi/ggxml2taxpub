      <p> Percy et al . (2018) presented two mitogenome (mtg) phylogenies that we refer to here as
         the AN tree (‘allnucleotide’ tree) and the CC tree (‘conserved-codon’ tree), as well as a
         much reduced taxon sampling using a nuclear genome analysis, and a combined mitochondrial
         and nuclear data analysis. Due to the greater taxon sampling for the mitogenome analyses,
         we refer mostly to these results here. The results of Cho et al . (2019) are similar to the
         AN tree. In the main, analyses in Percy et al . (2018) and Cho et al. (2019) had
         considerable congruence, with notable exceptions discussed below. Both mtg trees are
         similar and recover the same crown groups. The major difference lies in the basal
         groupings. The <tp:taxon-name>Aphalaridae Löw, 1879</tp:taxon-name> , as defined here, is a
         paraphyletic basal assemblage in the AN tree (also paraphyletic in Cho et al . 2019 ) and a
         poorly supported monophylum in the CC tree. <tp:taxon-name>Carsidaridae Crawford,
            1911</tp:taxon-name> (including <tp:taxon-name> Pachypsylla </tp:taxon-name> ) and
            <tp:taxon-name> Homotomidae Heslop-Harrison, 1958 </tp:taxon-name> form a poorly
         supported sister group in the AN tree and a paraphyletic, basal assemblage in the CC tree.
         The former hypothesis (i.e., sister family relationship between
            <tp:taxon-name>Carsidaridae</tp:taxon-name> (without <tp:taxon-name> Pachypsyllinae
            Crawford, 1914 </tp:taxon-name> ) and <tp:taxon-name>Homotomidae</tp:taxon-name> ) is
         supported by two putative morphological synapomorphies ( Hollis &amp; Broomfield 1989 ) and
         is recovered with stronger support in the nuclear genome data in Percy et al . (2018) as
         well as combined data in Cho et al . (2019) . In both mtg trees, the <tp:taxon-name>
            Mastigimatinae Bekker-Migdisova, 1973 </tp:taxon-name> constitutes the sister group to a
         well supported (94%) clade comprising the <tp:taxon-name>Liviidae Löw, 1879</tp:taxon-name>
         , as defined here, and the PTCD clade ( <tp:taxon-name>Psyllidae</tp:taxon-name> ,
            <tp:taxon-name>Triozidae Löw, 1879</tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name> Calophyinae
            Vondráček, 1957 sensu Burckhardt &amp; Ouvrard (2012) </tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name>
            Diaphorina Löw,1880 </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> Katacephala Crawford, 1914
         </tp:taxon-name> ). This grouping differs from that of Burckhardt &amp; Ouvrard (2012) who
         included <tp:taxon-name>Mastigimatinae</tp:taxon-name> in their artificial
            <tp:taxon-name>Calophyidae</tp:taxon-name> . For this reason,
            <tp:taxon-name>Mastigimatinae</tp:taxon-name> is removed from
            <tp:taxon-name>Calophyidae</tp:taxon-name> and given family rank here. This move is
         supported by Cho et al . (2019) although the phylogenetic placement of
            <tp:taxon-name>Mastigimatinae</tp:taxon-name> is not identical. The
            <tp:taxon-name>Liviidae</tp:taxon-name> , as defined here, is a poorly supported
         monophylum in the AN tree and paraphyletic in the CC tree. It is also recovered as
         paraphyletic in combined data analyses in both Percy et al. (2018) and Cho et al . (2019) .
         In both mtg trees, the PTCD clade is very strongly supported (100%) (consistent with Cho et
         al . 2019 ), and <tp:taxon-name> Calophyidae Vondráček, 1957 </tp:taxon-name> (without
            <tp:taxon-name>Mastigimatinae</tp:taxon-name> ) constitutes the sister taxon of the
         remainder of taxa in the PTCD clade with good (AN tree) or poor support ( CC tree);
         notably, an alternative placement of <tp:taxon-name>Calophyidae</tp:taxon-name> as sister
         to <tp:taxon-name>Triozidae</tp:taxon-name> (albeit with mixed support) in combined data
         analyses in both Percy et al . (2018) and Cho et al . (2019) serves to emphasise that
         phylogenetic placement within the PTCD clade awaits robust confirmation. The support of the
         monophyly of <tp:taxon-name>Psyllidae</tp:taxon-name> (including <tp:taxon-name> Diaphorina
         </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> Katacephala </tp:taxon-name> ) is good (AN tree) or
         poor ( CC tree) and that of <tp:taxon-name>Triozidae</tp:taxon-name> very strong in both
         trees (99%). Again, due to ambiguity in the placement of <tp:taxon-name> Diaphorina
         </tp:taxon-name> in the combined data analysis in Percy et al . (2018) , additional
         analyses will be required for robust confirmation. In summary, not all taxonomic groups
         recognized here are strongly supported as monophyla in all or any of the molecular
         analyses, in some cases we have erred on the side of providing a practical and stable
         classification, particularly where ambiguity in molecular analyses remains. A summary of
         family interrelationships adopted here is shown in Fig. 1 . </p>
