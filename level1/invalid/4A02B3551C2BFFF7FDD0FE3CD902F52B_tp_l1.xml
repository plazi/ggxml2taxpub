Remarks
</p>
      <p>
Morrison (1927: 104
; 
1928: 148
) provided a description of this genus, based on its 
type
species, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Aspidoproctus cinerea
Green, 1922
</tp:taxon-name>
. However, neither this description nor the original description by 
Green (1922: 450)
were accompanied by the total figures of the mounted female body and this significantly impedes the correct interpretation of the taxonomic characters. During a revisionary study of the old material, preserved in the collection of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, an adult female specimen was discovered and successfully prepared; this specimen matches the descriptions of 
Green (1922)
and 
Morrison (1927
, 
1928
). A redescription and a modern-style figure of the species are provided here based on this specimen.
