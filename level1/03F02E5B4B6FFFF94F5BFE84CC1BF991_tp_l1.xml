COLORATION. General color yellowish brown to brown (
Fig. 1
). Vertex (
Fig. 1G
) grayish brown, middle area somewhat reddish orange. Frons grayish brown. Clypeus yellow brown. Rostrum yellow brown, distal part black brown. Genae yellow brown to brown. Eyes black brown, ocelli reddish brown. Antennae yellow brown, first segment with distal part and second segment with base part dark brown (
Fig. 1H–I
). Pronotum grayish brown, middle area somewhat reddish orange, lateral margin brown. Mesonotum grayish brown to brown, intercarinal area somewhat reddish orange (
Fig. 1G
). Forewings (
Fig. 2D
) semitransparent, basal half with large inclined yellowish brown stripe, apical half except area between veins ScP and MP1 yellowish brown, a small round callus near ScP-R fork and another near CuA fork piceous, veins brown with yellowish white granules, veins dashed, apex of longitudinal veins brown. Thorax with ventral and lateral areas grayish brown. Legs yellowish brown to brown, with dark brown ring markings.

      <p>
HEAD AND THORAX.Vertex (
Fig. 2A
) at midline shorter than wide at base (0.29:1), width at apex narrower than at base (0.64:1). Frons (
Fig. 2C
) 1.23 times longer in middle line than widest part, narrower at apex than at base (0.69:1). Antennae (
Fig. 2C
) with first segment longer than wide at apex (1.25:1), shorter than second segment (0.48:1). Pronotum (
Fig. 2A
) at midline slightly shorter than vertex (0.91:1), lateral carinae arched, medially concave, flexing backwards near middle at sub-right angle and nearly attaining hind margin. Mesonotum (
Fig. 2A
) 2.82 times as long as vertex and pronotum combined in middle line. Forewing (
Fig. 2D
) in middle line longer than wide at widest part (2.75:1). Spinal formula of hind tibia 5-7-5.
</p>
      <p>
MALE GENITALIA. Anal segment (
Fig. 2E
) in lateral view small, ring-like, without anal process. Pygofer narrow with ventral margin much longer than dorsal margin in lateral view, laterodorsal angles not produced, posterior lateral margins broadly sinuate (
Fig. 2F
); in posterior view with opening longer than wide, lateral margin thick and not well defined, medioventral process absent (
Fig. 2G
). Genital styles (
Fig. 2H–J
) long, reaching basal anal segment, apical part distinctly curved inward, outer apical angle rounded and protruding slightly dorsad, inner apical angle quadrate, with inner edge angularly directed dorsally in lateral view. Aedeagus (
Fig. 2K–M
) long, tubular, with distinct phallotheca, with basal part lying between two valvular processes of phallotheca, deflecting leftward, apical part recurved downward and reaching ⅔ of phallotheca. Phallotheca almost reaching base of genital styles, apical part warping dorsad, basal part stout, with two valvular processes, in dorsal view with a large and a small round valvular processes, tapering from ½ to apex, in right view with three processes near base.
