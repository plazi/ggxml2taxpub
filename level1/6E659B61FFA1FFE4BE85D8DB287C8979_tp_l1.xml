based on the strong, pointed apicomesal lobes on tergum X. Of these species, the new species is most similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. erecta
</tp:taxon-name>
, because the apicomesal lobes in both species touch distally and each lobe bears one pair of short, thin apical setae in dorsal view, while in

S. erecta
</tp:taxon-name>
has one pair of mediumsized, thin setae (absent in 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. jeaneae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
, this segment is slender, strongly curved medially, and has a slightly acute apex. Furthermore, 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. blahniki

sp. nov.
can be recognized by the stethoscope-shaped phallotremal sclerite of the phallic apparatus in dorsal view, while in 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. erecta
</tp:taxon-name>
this sclerite is ribbon-shaped and in 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. jeaneae

Etymology
</p>
      <p>
The specific epithet is in honor of Dr Roger J. Blahnik (University of 
Minnesota
, 
USA
) in recognition of his contributions to the taxonomy and systematics of Neotropical caddisflies.

COLOR. General color brown (in alcohol) (
Fig. 1A
). Antennae yellowish brown (
Fig. 1A
). Head brown, denuded (
Fig. 1B–C
); dorsally with weakly-pronounced median suture; with five setal warts; anteromesal wart small, rounded; anterolateral pair undivided, weakly delimited; posterolateral pair large, ovoid (
Fig. 1C
). Maxillary palp with segments 1–4 increasing gradually about 0.8× in size toward more apical segments, segment 5 long, about 1.2× as long as all previous segments combined (
Fig. 1B
). Thorax pale brown, without setae (old specimens); legs brown, with mid leg tarsi yellowish (
Fig. 1A
). Wing venation typical for subgenus (
Fig. 1D–E
). Forewings, in alcohol, uniformly brown, with small white spot on apex of Cu2 (
Fig. 1D

Fig. 1F

MALE GENITALIA (
Fig. 2
). Segment IX in lateral view with anterolateral margin nearly straight, strongly sclerotized (
Fig. 2A
); posterodorsal margin bearing small spicules, distributed in a subtriangular band (
Fig. 2B
). Tergum X elongate; in lateral view, ventrolateral margin strongly sclerotized, with four mediumsized, thin setae on apical third; apex with sharp notch, ending in slender, straight lobe (
Fig. 2A

Fig. 2C
); apex enlarged, without processes or plates; endothecal membranes without spines; phallotremal sclerite, in dorsal view, distinct, strongly sclerotized, stethoscope-shaped, proximal region slightly bifid and distal region with acute arms (
Fig. 2D–E

The males of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. blahniki
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
were collected near a 1 
st
order stream, where the predominant vegetation is highland savanna with a minimum altitude of 
1112 m
a.s.l. (
Fig 4A
). This stream is located in the Serra do Aracá mountain range, northern Brazilian Amazon. The water in the stream was black and acidic (pH 4.6), with low conductivity (10 
μScm-1
), and a water temperature of 22°C. The stream was about 
0.5 m
wide, 
0.30 m
deep, with rocky bottoms characterized by boulders and slow-flowing water.
