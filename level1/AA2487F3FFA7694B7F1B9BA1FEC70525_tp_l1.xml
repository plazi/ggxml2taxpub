Description
</p>
      <p>
Female
(
Figs 53–69
)
</p>
      <p>COLORATION. General color chestnut brown; abdominal tergites darker than head and thorax, abdominal sternites lighter than tergites; legs not distinctly lighter than thorax. Vertex and frons demarcated by M-shaped dark marking; a U-shaped dark stripe, originating from M-shaped mark, extends vertically over vertex; beneath M-shaped mark, a pair of inverted, drop-shaped lighter areas present; a broader stripe originates from dorsomesal margin of eye, extending vertically over vertex. A third pair of dark stripes extend between subgenal suture and occiput on either side of head. Clypeus concolorus with vertex, except anterior margin lighter. Labrum slightly darker than vertex. Thoracic sternites apparently lighter than tergites.</p>
      <p>
HEAD (
Fig. 55
). Vertex strongly convex. Distance between eyes 1.38 times distance between antennal sockets. Frons moderately convex between antennal sockets, gradually turning flat, then depressed ventrally; minutely transversely wrinkled ventrally. Eyes with mesal margin concave near antennal socket, lateral margin strongly rounded. Clypeus a little shorter than labrum, rectangular, strongly transverse, nearly three times wider than long, with an indistinct vertical carina in middle, surface hardly depressed on either side of carina. Visible part of mandibles about two times longer than labrum, with five denticles visible.
</p>
      <p>
THORAX. Pronotum (
Fig. 56
) 1.64 times wider than long, anteriorly 1.26 times wider than posteriorly. Lateral margin strongly curved near anterior third, then becomes nearly straight posterior to that; anterolateral margin convex, forming somewhat obtuse angle with anterior margin. Posterior margin concave medially. Pronotal anteapical transverse impression merged with anterolateral depressions on either side. Oblique sulcus originating from postero-lateral corner of pronotum well developed. Prosternite wider than long, converge posteriorly, posterior margin emarginate medially, with two pairs of ventral cervical sclerites; lateral cervical sclerites acutely narrowed distally, oblique; prosternite distally with setose, raised portion medially. Metathoracic basisternum with posterior margin emarginate medially.
</p>
      <p>HIND LEGS. Coxa depressed ventrally. Metatibia with dorsolateral margin with three small denticles, dorsomesal margin with a row of four small denticles.</p>
      <p>
ABDOMEN (
Figs 57–60
). Supragenital plate wider than long, semicircular (
Figs 61–62
). Subgenital plate transverse, with posterior margin straight in middle (
Figs 60
, 
63
).
</p>
      <p>
FEMALE GENITALIA (
Figs 64–69
). Ovipositor with dorsal valve broader and slightly longer than ventral. Base of ventral valve with two pairs of obliquely placed thick sclerites; inner one short, oblong; outer one longer. Vagina longer than dorsal valve in length, semicircular with lateral sides each bearing an elongate, unsclerotized vaginal plate at middle. Spermathecal duct elongate, narrower in proximal half, then distinctly widened beyond middle up to distal third quarter, entering vagina dorsally, at middle. Median oviduct merged with ventral wall of vagina. Spermatheca nearly bean-shaped, surface with depressions, integument reticulated (
Fig. 67
). Spermathecal gland elongate, shorter than spermathecal duct, bulged near proximal third and distal end. Sternite VIII (
Figs 68–69
) transverse, in ventral view with apical margin indistinctly emarginate medially, with a dorsal infolding bearing several elongate setae; in dorsal view distal margin emarginate medially.

Habitat
</p>
      <p>
Kallar, the 
type
locality of the new species, is on the lower reaches of the Agasthyamalai Biosphere Reserve at the southern end of the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. Most of Kallar still retains the forest cover and is slated to form part of the newly proposed Ponmudi Wildlife Sanctuary.

      <p>
Behavior
</p>
      <p>
The single specimen was picked up on a bright sunny day (H.M. Yeshwanth pers. com., 
18 September 2019
).
