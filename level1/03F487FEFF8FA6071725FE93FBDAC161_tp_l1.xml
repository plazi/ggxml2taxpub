Description
</p>
      <p>All features of the diagnosis. Cephalothorax comprises 30% of body length, pleon (without telson) 55%, and carapace (without rostrum) 32%. Abdominal somites 1–5 measure 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.9, and 0.9 times the length of somite 6, respectively.</p>
      <p>
CARAPACE (

). Carapace covers 75% of cephalothorax dorsally. Rostrum reaches to proximal third of artificially straight forward-oriented eyestalks (without cornea). Cervical sulcus short but strong. Posterior margin leaving 1–2 posterior thoracic somites mid-dorsally exposed.
</p>
      <p>
EYES (
Fig. 12
A–B). Eyestalks and cornea dorsoventrally compressed (
Fig. 12B
). Eyestalks without scales. In dorsal view (
Fig. 12A
) the cornea appears calotte-shaped, measuring 4/5 length of eyestalk
</p>
      <p>
(cornea not included). In lateral view (
Fig. 12B
) the cornea appears roughly trapezoid with well-rounded edges, length 1.4–1.5 times maximum width.
</p>
      <p>
ANTENNULAE (
Fig. 12
C–E). Trunk extends 56–62% its length beyond eyes, 12–14% beyond antennal scale. Measured without apophysis along dorsal midline, the basal segment is 47–48% trunk length, median segment 10–18%, and terminal segment 34–43%. Basal segment on basal half of its outer face with two small, stout, barbed setae as in 
Fig. 2D
. Dorsal apophysis with three barbed setae and one whip seta (
Fig. 12E
). Lateral apophysis with two barbed setae and one smooth seta. Median segment dorsally with large apophysis bearing three barbed setae and one whip seta. Terminal segment 1.3–1.4 times as long as wide. Its mid-dorsal apophysis with four small, barbed setae. Outer antennular flagellum is thicker than inner one by factor of 1.5–1.7 when measured near basis of flagella. Male lobe setose, inserts ventrally close to terminal margin of antennular trunk, length is 22–31% width of terminal segment of trunk, its width 22–25%.
</p>
      <p>
ANTENNAE (
Fig. 12A
). Three-segmented antennal peduncle with basal segment 20% length of peduncle, second segment 47–48%, and third segment 33%. Sympod with tongue-like, terminally broad process on ventral face (as in 
Fig. 10E
).

Inner margin of median segment with three sparsely barbed setae in subapical to subbasal position, and with 4–6 short setae on proximal third. Basal half of these setae thickened; with unilateral series of stiff barbs; distal half smooth (
Fig. 12G
). Outer margin of median segment all along with setae; most setae barbed on basal third. No scales present on median segment. Terminal segment strongly setose (most setae below drawing plane in 
Fig. 12F
), this segment 27–28% palp length. Pars molaris with well-developed grinding surface in both mandibles. Pars incisiva with four teeth, digitus mobilis with three teeth, and pars centralis with 4–5 spiny teeth. Labium as described above for

The species is so far known only from a service tank of the ‘Waikiki Aquarium’, Honolulu, Hawaii. Origin most likely in coastal marine waters of the Central Pacific (
