Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
This species may be separated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. madagascariensis
</tp:taxon-name>
and other African species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Charinus
</tp:taxon-name>
by means of the following combination of characters: large size; tritosternum short, not reaching base of pedipalp coxae (
Fig. 90B
); pedipalp tarsus with three spines (
Fig. 90D
); tibia of leg I with 23 articles, tarsus I with 41 articles; leg IV basitibia with four pseudo-articles.
</p>
      <p>
This species resembles 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. africanus
</tp:taxon-name>
, but bears five teeth on the cheliceral claw, compared with six teeth in 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. africanus
</tp:taxon-name>
, and a greater number of spines on the pedipalp.

Description
</p>
      <p>
CARAPACE. Lateral margin ventral to lateral eyes, markedly bent ventrally, creating appearance of projection of anterior carapace margin (
Fig. 90A
); six anterior setae (
Fig. 90A
); frontal process triangular (
Fig. 90C
). Small granules densely scattered between ocular triads and among sulci. Median eyes well developed (
Fig. 90C
); median ocular tubercle reduced, with pair of setae; lateral eyes well developed, seta posterior to lateral ocular triad; lateral ocular triad well separated from carapace margin.
</p>
      <p>
STERNUM. Tritosternum projected anteriorly with typical setation, short, only reaching base of pedipalp coxae (
Fig. 90B
); other sternal platelets narrow and concave, with pair of setae anteriorly on plaque and some smaller setae posteriorly; pentasternum with four setae anteriorly and without seta in membranous region.
</p>
      <p>OPISTHOSOMA. Ventral sacs and ventral sac cover absent.</p>
      <p>
GENITALIA. Female genital operculum with prominent setae posteromedially and some smaller setae near margin (
Fig. 91A–C
); gonopod cushion-like and sclerotized basally (
Fig. 91A–B, D–E
); apex of cushionlike gonopod serrated (
Fig. 91D–E
); slit sensilla on lateral margin of genital operculum (
Fig. 91F
). Male gonopod with apical border of fistula and lateral lobe sclerotized; LoL2 fimbriate and short (
Fig. 92A, D–E
); LoL1 well developed (
Fig. 92A, C
); LoD narrow, with denticulate surface (
Fig. 92B, E
).
</p>
      <p>
CHELICERAE. Small tooth projecting from retrolateral surface of basal segment, opposite to bifid tooth (
Fig. 10B
); retrolateral surface of claw with continous row of setae, basally to medially (
Fig. 10B
); claw with five teeth (
Fig. 10A
); row of more than 20 setae on prolateral surface of basal segment; bifid tooth on basal segment with dorsal cusp larger than ventral cusp (
Fig. 10A–B
).
</p>
      <p>
PEDIPALPS. Coxal dorsal carina with five or six prominent setae encircled by round carina and three setae on margin. Femur with four dorsal spines and four ventral spines (
Fig. 90E–F
); long spine between ventral spine 1 and proximal margin; three prominent setiferous tubercles between dorsal spine 1 and proximal margin. Patella with four long dorsal spines in primary series (
Fig. 90E
); prominent setiferous tubercle distal to spine I, half length of spine I; three ventral spines (
Fig. 90F
); prominent setiferous tubercle between spine I and distal margin. Tibia with ventral spine distally and two setae between spine and distal margin. Tarsus with three dorsal spines, spine 1 long, one-third length of tarsus, spine 2 aligned with and half length of spine 1 (
Fig. 90D
); spine 3 one-third length of spine 2 and situated near its base; cleaning organ with 22–24 setae in ventral row.
</p>
      <p>
LEGS. Tibia of leg I with 23 articles; tarsus I with 41 articles; first tarsal article similar in length to subsequent article. Leg IV basitibia with four pseudo-articles, with sclerotized, denticulate projection at apex of articles; trichobothrium 
bt
situated submedially on pseudo-article; leg IV distitibia trichobothrium
