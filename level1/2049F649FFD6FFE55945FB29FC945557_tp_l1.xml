Redescription
</p>
      <p>
BODY LENGTH. 2.0– 
2.1 mm
.
</p>
      <p>COLOUR. Body integument entirely black, shiny; vestiture of elytra consisting of whitish and brownish, recumbent, elliptical scales, twice as long as wide; whitish scales forming two ill-defined, oblique bands from humeri to apical ¾ of elytral suture and a spot on declivital callosities.</p>
      <p>
HEAD. Rostrum longer than head + prothorax in lateral view, almost straight (
Fig. 4B
), dorsal face punctate, covered with suberect whitish scales forming four distinct series in basal ¾ and two spots near eyes, apical ⅓ bearing scattered white setae; transverse furrow at base of rostrum shiny, bare of scales; head capsule glabrous; eyes flat, sub-contiguous on ventral side; scape of antennae slightly bisinuate, slightly and regularly widening toward apex, not clavate at apex, segment 1 of funicle elongate, longer than 2 + 3, 2 square, 3–7 wider than long.
</p>
      <p>PROTHORAX. Isodiametric (ratio w/l: 1), widest near middle of length, sides moderately rounded, not greatly narrowed at apex; integument punctuate and granulous, punctures forming weak concentric circles in basal ½; scales whitish and brownish, elongate, mostly condensed along the median line and on the sides.</p>
      <p>ELYTRA. Sides subparallel in basal ¾ of length, rounded in apical ⅓, widest near middle of length (ratio w/l: 0.70); humeri raised; striae narrow, interstriae flat, wide, 4× as wide as striae, integument shiny, slightly reticulate, apex of interstria 5 with a very slight declivital callosity; scutellum small, bare of scales.</p>
      <p>ABDOMEN. Underside mostly covered with non-overlapping greyish scales, not condensed on metanepisterna.</p>
      <p>LEGS. Covered with whitish, semi-erect, elongate scales; femora clavate, armed with a tiny ventral tooth, usually concealed with scales; tibiae straight on external side, slightly bisinuate ventrally; claws equal in</p>
      <p>length. Genitalia. Body of penis elongate (ratio w/l: 0.33), 1.3 × as long as apodemes, sides sub-parallel, broadly rounded at apex, curvature in lateral view moderate and regular, tapering at apex (Fig. 5I).</p>
      <p>
Sexual dimorphism
</p>
      <p>Females are distinguished from males by their rostrum, which is slightly longer, and covered with scales only in basal ¼ (in basal ⅓ in males).</p>

Life history
</p>
      <p>
All recently collected specimens of this species were found on dodders (
<tp:taxon-name>
Cuscuta
</tp:taxon-name>
spp.) including the introduced weed 
<tp:taxon-name>
Cuscuta campestris
Yunck, 1932
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. 6
A–B). Labels indicate that this species might be collected with light traps (UV light). Adults were collected from October to March.

Distribution

      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Smicronyx fallax
</tp:taxon-name>
is widely distributed in the subtropical and desert areas of southern Africa. It has been recorded from 
Namibia
to 
Zimbabwe
, and in the 
Gauteng
, 
KwaZulu-Natal
, 
Limpopo
, 
Mpumalanga
and Orange provinces of the 
Republic of South Africa

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
The type specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. fallax
</tp:taxon-name>
was deposited by Gyllenhal in the collection of Ecklon &amp; Zeyer (
Gyllenhal 1836
), currently lost. In the absence of further information about this type, and in order to stabilize the taxonomy in this genus, a 
neotype
was designated based on the description of this species. Gyllenhal described 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. fallax
</tp:taxon-name>
as a species very closely related to the Palaearctic taxon 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. jungermanniae
Reich, 1797
</tp:taxon-name>
. This description corresponded very well to the specimens used to re-describe this species, both regarding external and internal morphology. In addition, 
COI
sequences obtained from these specimens (JHAR01630_0101-1694_0101 [GB accession: 
MT370316
-17]) showed that they are closest to 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. jungermanniae
</tp:taxon-name>
out of all the species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Smicronyx
</tp:taxon-name>
for which a barcode sequence is available (uncorrected p-distance of 7.0%). The 
neotype
(here designated) was designated for a male specimen from a population from the western side of 
KwaZulu-Natal Province
in the 
Republic of South Africa
, which is close to the original type locality of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. fallax
</tp:taxon-name>
(“Caffraria”, probably corresponding to the 
Eastern Cape Province
). Three male and nine unsexed specimens stored in ethanol from this series were deposited in the institutions CBGP, SAMC and SANC.
