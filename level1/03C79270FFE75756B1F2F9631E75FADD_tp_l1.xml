Description
</p>
      <p>
The five specimens were collected together with another five specimens that all together were reported as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Echinoderes
cf. 
ehlersi
</tp:taxon-name>
by 
Higgins &amp; Rao (1979)
. However, our examinations suggested that the latter five specimens represent a new species. The five specimens, addressed in the following, differ from 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. chandrasekharai
Sørensen &amp; Chatterjee
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
and as 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. ehlersi
</tp:taxon-name>
in some significant points, but since the specimens' condition (e.g., the disability to observe sensory spots consistently) did not provide sufficient information for a complete description and specimens for SEM were not available, we will for now only provide a short description of the observed characters without providing a formal species description.

The examined specimens resemble species like 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. kozloffi
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. pacificus
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. sublicarum
</tp:taxon-name>
in general trunk appearance (
Fig. 25A
) and dimensions (see 
Table 19
). The distribution of glandular cell outlets 
type
1 (
Fig. 25
B–G) is similar to the distribution in 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. pacificus
</tp:taxon-name>
also (see 
Table 8
), and so is the distribution of those sensory spots that could be observed. However, the presence or absence of sensory spots could not be confirmed in the following positions: sublateral segment 1, middorsal segment 2, midlateral segment 4 and segment 9. The spine/tube pattern and the approximate dimensions are similar with those of 
<tp:taxon-name>
E. kozloffi
</tp:taxon-name>
, i.e., the middorsal spine on segment 8 reaches to a point around the midline of segment 9 (
Fig. 25D, F
), but never onto segment 10. Glandular cell outlets 
type
2 are present in midlateral positions, but only on segment 8 (
Fig. 25F
). Female papillae are present in ventromedial positions on segments 7 (more lateral) and 8 (more medial) (
Fig. 25E
). The substructures of the papillae on segment 7 are crescentic with a small protuberance in the curved parts of the structures, whereas the substructures on segment 8 form narrow tubes (
Fig. 25E
). Tergal extensions of terminal segment and shape of lateral terminal spines resemble those in
