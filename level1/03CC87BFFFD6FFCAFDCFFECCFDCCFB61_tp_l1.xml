Description
</p>
      <p>
Specimen MB.C.29739 has a conch diameter of 
47 mm
, but the beginning of the terminal body chamber is already at 
31 mm
, as indicated by two narrowly spaced septa (
Fig. 22B
). The weakly corroded specimen shows a ww/wh ratio of 1.50 at 
32 mm
dm; the whorl profile is trapezoidal with broadly rounded venter. The sculpture possesses six as well as eight conical midflank nodes on the last two volutions of the phragmocone, respectively.
</p>
      <p>
The suture line of specimen MB.C.29739 has an external lobe that is almost as deep as the adventive lobe; it possesses three small notches. There follow an inverted U-shaped ventrolateral saddle and an adventive lobe that is widest at its base. It has about eight small notches. The parallel-sided lateral saddle is lower than the ventrolateral saddle and the lateral lobe, subdivided by seven very small notches, is only half as deep as the adventive lobe (
Fig. 22F
).
</p>
      <p>
Specimen MB.C.29743 is a specimen with 
48 mm
conch diameter and has a phragmocone diameter of 
36 mm
(
Fig. 22C
). Its body chamber has a rounded-trapezoidal, weakly depressed whorl profile (ww/ wh= 1.30) with broadly rounded venter. In the subadult stage, the ww/wh ratio is higher than 1.50 and the whorl profile has a depressed oval shape. The sculpture in the subadult stage has eight coarse and pointed conical midflank nodes per volution; these nodes become much weaker on the body chamber and are replaced by weak, radial ribs, which are coarsest in the ventrolateral region.
</p>
      <p>
The suture line of specimen MB.C.29743 differs from the preceding in the simple, unsubdivided prongs of the external lobe that is not as deep as the adventive lobe, the inflated ventrolateral saddle and the wider lateral saddle (
Fig. 22E
).

The suture line of the smaller specimen MB.C.29744 is remarkable because of its asymmetric external lobe with one prong being unsubdivided and the other possessing three small notches. It shows a narrow, dorsally inclined and weakly inflated ventrolateral saddle and a multiply serrated, asymmetric adventive lobe that is widest at its base (
Fig. 22G
).
