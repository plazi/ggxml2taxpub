Etymology
</p>
      <p>
The new species is named after Varuna, the god of rains in Indian mythology. The name is a noun in apposition. This cricket was observed coming out to open areas such as campus roads following rains, hence the name. In the regional dialect, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ot. varuna
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
is called ‘ 
Mannunni
’, meaning ‘child of soil’. Also nicknamed ‘ 
Thanni-Pillai
’, meaning ‘baby of water’, alluding to its emergence following rains.

were geographically isolated multiple times in the Quarternary and most recently during the separation of 
Sri Lanka
from south 
India
, around 7500 years ago with the Holocene rises in sea level (
Gunatilaka 2000
). Poorly developed hind wings indicate that 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ot. varuna
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
could be flightless, despite being alate. Wing venation varies considerably, in the branching pattern, shape of veins and cross veins (
Figs 10–12
). 
Béthoux (2012)
showed that in king crickets, raspy crickets and weta, wing venation vary greatly within species and several species delimited based on wing venation are synonyms. 
Ross (2012)
, who studied cockroaches, proved that forewings of a cockroach species vary considerably; even the left and right wings on the same specimen are slightly different. According to 
Ross (2012)
, since forewings in cockroaches are not used for active flight, the positions of the veins, which are important for the aerodynamics and flexing of the wings, vary greatly. The intraspecific variation in the wing venation in 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
, could be the outcome of a flightless, subterranean mode of life.

Agricultural University (

and elsewhere.

Notes on biology
</p>
      <p>
Female reproductive system
</p>
      <p>
Ovaries were paired and each ovary (
Fig. 37
) consists of more than 10 panoistic ovarioles, each ovariole containing about 
six eggs
(
Fig. 38
). A total of about 175– 
200 eggs
were present inside the ovaries of an individual. Mature eggs are lemon-shaped (
Fig. 39
). Fully developed eggs in the ovary indicate that the dissected as well as the other examined specimens, which are morphologically identical, are probably all adults.
</p>
      <p>
Habitat
</p>
      <p>
Vellayani campus of the 
Kerala
Agricultural University is the sole known habitat of the new species. The total area of the campus is about 
2.52 km
2
. This is a highly populated residential area and the open lands are under cultivation with various agricultural crops. Chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used to raise the crops. The campus has a network of roads connecting academic and residential buildings and other facilities. The soil 
type
is red loam and the average annual rainfall is 
1577 mm
.
</p>
      <p>
Seasonality
</p>
      <p>
Most females were seen walking on the open campus roads during or after a downpour, both during day and night. One individual was caught around midday on 
8 September 2019
, when it was bright and sunny. Emergence of females of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ot. varuna
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
coincides with the south-west monsoon rains during June to September. However, males are extremely rare and two individuals were collected following summer rains during the peak summer of 
March 2021
.
</p>
      <p>
Food habits as indicated by the gut contents
(
Figs 40–47
)
</p>
      <p>
Examination of the gut contents of three of the specimens revealed the presence of mandibles of mandibulate soldiers (
Figs 40–41
) and workers (
Fig. 42
) of the termite 
<tp:taxon-name>
Odontotermes
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
(Blattaria, 
<tp:taxon-name>Termitidae</tp:taxon-name>
); and the body parts, including head (
Fig. 43
), thorax (
Figs 44–45
), and abdomen of ants (probably 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pheidole
sp.
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Hymenoptera</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Formicidae</tp:taxon-name>
). Interestingly, a piece of the stem of a plant (
0.58 mm
× 
0.43 mm
) (
Fig. 46
) and sand particles (
0.24–0.62 mm
diameter) (
Fig. 47
) were also observed inside the gut.
</p>
      <p>
Behavior
</p>
      <p>
The new species is a ‘heel-walker’ (
Fig. 49
, Supp. file 3). They walk on the distal tip of tibiae with the foretarsi always held raised, while the mid- and hind tarsi are in close proximity to the ground, yet not touching it while walking. However, when not moving, all the tarsi may touch the ground. While walking, the long maxillary palpi are held forward and constantly touch the objects in the foreground in tandem. South African Jerusalem Crickets are known to hop and climb vegetation (
Weissman &amp; Bazelet 2013
) while some of the New World species exhibit drumming (abdomen striking against the substrate) (
Weissman 2001a
). However, no such behaviors were observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. varuna
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
When a female was held above the ground level on a flat substrate, it rather tumbled down instead of hopping. It also failed to climb up sticks on which it was placed. A male was observed flapping wings and performing short jumps of about 
0.3 m
.
</p>
      <p>
Defense
</p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Oryctopterus varuna
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
displayed intricate defensive postures when intimidated. Confronted from the front, the cricket sprang into a pouncing posture, raised its forelegs and waved in mid-air, the mandibles opened widely, as if ready to bite (
Fig. 50
, Supp. file 1). When approached from the anterolateral side, it raised the front leg on that side to defend. However, when the animal was poked on the thorax, in addition to the forelegs, the abdomen also was raised, to startle the attacker (
Fig. 51
). When an individual is pinned down with the index finger firmly pressed on the thorax, the whole body was flexed and all legs were raised and started kicking to fend off the assailant. They inflicted painful bites when handled. 
Weissman (2001a)
reported that New World Stenopelmatine, when confronted, frequently flip on their back, with mandibles agape, or can rear up.
</p>
      <p>
Burrowing
</p>
      <p>
Burrowing was observed by releasing an adult female into a 
23.50 cm
high, 
21.50 cm
wide polypropylene tub filled with loose soil up to 
⅔
the height of the tub. Mainly head and legs are used in burrowing. To begin with, the forelegs were firmly held against the ground to anchor the body, then the head was bent down, moving forward and backward to dig up the soil, with the mandibles acting like a shovel (
Fig. 52
, Supp. file 2). The dug-up soil was then pushed backwards and sideways with hindlegs and midlegs respectively. In the laboratory, it made a burrow that was vertical initially but turned oblique, then horizontal and nearly parallel to the surface. Observed behavior suggests that the

are subterranean, inhabiting underground burrows.
