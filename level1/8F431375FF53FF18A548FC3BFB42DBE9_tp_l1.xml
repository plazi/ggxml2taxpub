Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
This species may be separated from other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sarax
</tp:taxon-name>
in Southeast Asia and Oceania by the following combination of characters: uniform coloration without distinct stripes; female genital plaque flattened posteromedially; basal segment of chelicera with tooth on retrolateral surface, opposite to bifid tooth; leg IV basitibia with three pseudo-articles.
</p>
      <p>

Sarax singaporae
</tp:taxon-name>
differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. gravelyi

in the color and the number of pseudo-articles in the basitibia of leg IV.

Redescription
</p>
      <p>CARAPACE. Tegument dark brown; six anterior setae; frontal process short and triangular. Small granules densely scattered between ocular triads and among sulci; median eyes and median ocular tubercle well developed; pair of setae on median ocular tubercle; lateral eyes well developed, pale, with seta lateral to lateral ocular triad; lateral ocular triad near carapace margin; curved carina between ocular triads and carapace margin.</p>
      <p>STERNUM. Tritosternum projected anteriorly with typical setation, long, surpassing base of pedipalp coxae; other sternal platelets narrow and projected, with pair of setae anteriorly on plaque and some smaller setae posteriorly; pentasternum with six setae near anterior region of plaque.</p>
      <p>OPISTHOSOMA. Ventral sacs and ventral sacs cover well developed.</p>
      <p>GENITALIA. Female genital operculum with short setae posteromedially; medial region flat with slender setae apically; gonopod finger-like with small invagination apically, unsclerotized basally. Male genitalia unknown.</p>
      <p>CHELICERAE. Retrolateral surface of basal segment with short tooth opposite to bifid tooth; retrolateral surface of claw with row of setae basally to medially; claw with two or three teeth; more than two rows of several setae on prolateral surface of basal segment; bifid tooth on basal segment with dorsal cusp larger than ventral cusp.</p>
      <p>PEDIPALPS. Coxae without seta encircled by round carina and with two setae on margin. Femur with four or five dorsal spines and four ventral spines; two prominent setiferous tubercles between dorsal spine 1 and proximal margin; long spine between ventral spine 1 and proximal margin, two-thirds length of spine 1. Patella with five dorsal spines in primary series; prominent spine distal to spine I; four ventral spines; two small setiferous tubercles between spine I and distal margin. Tibia with ventral spine distally and two or three setae between spine and distal margin. Tarsus with two dorsal spines, distal spine longer, about one-fifth length of tarsus, proximal spine half length of distal spine; cleaning organ with 26 or 27 setae in ventral row.</p>
      <p>
LEGS. Tibia of leg I with 23–27 articles; tarsus I with 41 articles; first and second tarsal articles equal in length. Leg IV basitibia with three pseudo-articles, with sclerotized, denticulate border at apex of articles; trichobothrium 
bt
situated in proximal third of pseudo-article; distitibia trichobothrium 
bc
situated closer to 
bf
than to s

, 
sc
and 
sf
series each with six trichobothria.
