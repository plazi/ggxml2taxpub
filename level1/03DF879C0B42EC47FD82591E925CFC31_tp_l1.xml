Remarks
</p>
      <p>
The monotypic genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chilella
</tp:taxon-name>
was erected by 
DeLong &amp; Freytag (1967)
based on a single female specimen of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chilella rugella
DeLong &amp; Freytag, 1967
</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Chile
. According to the authors, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chilella
</tp:taxon-name>
differs from other genera of 
<tp:taxon-name>Gyponini</tp:taxon-name>
by the following set of characteristics: (1) crown short and broad; (2) transition crown-face rounded, without defined margin; (3) ocelli distant from eyes, located on anterior portion of crown; (4) forewing rugose, corrugated and without an appendix; and (5) foreleg with metatibia intercalary setae between macrosetae.
</p>
      <p>
Our study of the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chilella rugella
</tp:taxon-name>
(
Fig. 8A–E
) indicated that the position of the ocelli, which are located in the crown-face transition, is incongruent with the diagnoses proposed for 
<tp:taxon-name>Gyponini</tp:taxon-name>
by 
DeLong (1942)
, 

Oman
(1949)

, 
Linnavuori (1959)
, 
Dietrich (2005)
, and 

Krishnankutty 
et al
. (2016)

. According to those authors, the ocelli in 
<tp:taxon-name>Gyponini</tp:taxon-name>
are located on the crown, away from the anterior margin. Moreover, according to the key to the tribes of 
<tp:taxon-name>Iassinae</tp:taxon-name>
proposed by 

Krishnankutty 
et al
. (2016)

, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chilella rugella
</tp:taxon-name>
is classified as 
<tp:taxon-name>Selenomorphini Evans, 1974</tp:taxon-name>
, based on the following characteristics: (1) head with crown poorly delimited, rounded to face; (2) hind wing veins R4+5 and M1+2 separated distally, not confluent at apex; and (3) body pigmentation primarily pale green or stramineous.
</p>
      <p>
However, morphological characteristics of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rugella
</tp:taxon-name>
are not congruent with any genera currently included in 
<tp:taxon-name>Selenomorphini</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chilella
</tp:taxon-name>
differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Selenomorphus
Evans, 1974
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Linnavuoria
Dai &amp; Dietrich, 
2015
</tp:taxon-name>
in having the crown-face transition indistinct, whereas in the last two genera the crownface transition is distinctly angulated in profile. Also, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chilella
</tp:taxon-name>
differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pachyopsis
Uhler, 1877
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Uhleriana
Domahovski, 
2019
</tp:taxon-name>
in having the metatibiae with intercalary setae. In addition, it differs from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Parapachyopsis
Domahovski, 
2019
</tp:taxon-name>
in having the head narrower than the pronotum and from 
<tp:taxon-name>
Scaroidana
Osborn, 1938
</tp:taxon-name>
by its smaller size (9.0 mm) and position of the ocelli mesad to the antennal pits (
Fig. 8C
), whereas in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Scaroidana
</tp:taxon-name>
they are closer to the eyes and located above the antennal pits, in ventral view.
</p>
      <p>
Unfortunately, the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. rugella
</tp:taxon-name>
lost its forewings, which could have provided useful information about its relationships with other genera of 
<tp:taxon-name>Selenomorphini</tp:taxon-name>
. However, according to 
DeLong &amp; Freytag (1967)
, the forewings are rugose and corrugated, two features not found in any other genus of the tribe. We propose the transfer of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chilella
</tp:taxon-name>
to 
<tp:taxon-name>Selenomorphini</tp:taxon-name>
, maintaining it as a valid genus. However, the discovery of male specimens as well as phylogenetic studies on the tribe are necessary to confirm our proposal.
