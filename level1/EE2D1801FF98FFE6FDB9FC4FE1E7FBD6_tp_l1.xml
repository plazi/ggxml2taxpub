Differences were noticed in arrangement of sensory structures on labrum and frons, shape of mandible, number of teeth on hypostoma and prementum. Labrum bears two long setae and three sensory pegs on each side in the middle of anterior part (
Fig. 7D
). One long, three medium-long setae and sensory pit located on anterior margin of frons (
Fig. 7D
). Mandible conusshaped, with two large, blunt apical teeth, similar in shape and size (
Fig. 7E
), first ventral tooth is the largest, second ventral tooth blunt, basal teeth triangular. Dorsal tooth small and blunt. Prementum has four median large teeth with one smaller tooth on each side (
Fig. 7F
). Hypostoma bears 11 teeth, the middle tooth most prominent (
Fig. 7G
).

ANAL DIVISION. Spiracular field surrounded by four lobes, ventral and lateral lobes similar in length (
Fig. 8B, D
). Lateral lobe as long as wide, almost completely sclerotized, except small area in middle. Four medium-length setae located along the outer margin of lobe. Ventral lobe twice as long as width at base with dark U-shaped sclerite, ventral branches fused medially to form a complete line. Two long setae and three medium-length setae located at the apex. Paired medium-length setae and sensory pits located on dorsal margin of spiracular field. Spiracular field fringed with long firm setae, longest around apical margins of lobes. Each spiracle large, oblong, placed obliquely and inclined dorsally (
Fig. 8
A–B, D). Anal field consists of two pairs of conical, white, fleshy anal papillae (
Fig. 8C
).

THORAX. Pronotal horn large, flattened, ear shaped, anterior and posterior ends widely curved inwards (
Fig. 9C
). Outer margin of horn entirely covered with numerous tubercles (
Fig. 9D
). Dorsum of thorax smooth. Apex of wing reaches ¼ of third abdominal segment (
Fig. 9
A–B). Legs reach anterior third of sixth abdominal segment. The innermost pair of legs shortest, the outermost pair longest (
Fig. 9B
).
</p>
      <p>
ABDOMEN. Abdominal segments III–VI divided into anterior and posterior parts (
Fig. 9
A–C). Anterior part of dorsum of segments IV–VI with two transversal rows of spines (
Fig. 9A
) with segments III and VII with a single row of spines. Posterior part of segments III–VII with row of setae (five clusters composed of two setae each) (
Fig. 9C
), segments laterally with four to five long setae (
Fig. 9A
). Venter of abdominal segments VI–VII with two transversal rows of spines (
Fig. 9B
). Surface of abdominal segments smooth. Spiracles absent. Terminal segment slightly elongate (
Fig. 9E
). Sheath of cerci long, sclerotized and directed upward. Sheath of valvae reach only half length of sheath of cerci, not sclerotized. Mediodorsal spine well developed, triangular with rounded apex. A few long setae located on apex of both mediodorsal and anterodorsal spines.

Habitat
</p>
      <p>
Larvae develop on vertical cliff surfaces kept wet by a film of water supporting algal growth (
fauna hygropetrica
) (
Fig. 10
). Larvae usually make cases from silt (
Fig. 11
). Pupae can make cases from mosses and algae (
Fig. 12
).
