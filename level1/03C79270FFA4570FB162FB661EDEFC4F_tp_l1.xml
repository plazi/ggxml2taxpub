Echinoderes dujardinii
</tp:taxon-name>
was redescribed by 
Higgins (1977a)
, but due to the numerous new details (mainly revealed by SEM), reinterpretations of cuticular structures, and considerable changes in terminology over the past 40 years, we are providing a full description of the species.
</p>
      <p>
Adults with head, neck and eleven trunk segments (
Figs 2A
, 
3
, 
4A
). Trunk with nearly equally broad sternal plates on segments 5 to 10 (
Fig. 2A
). Lateral terminal spines slender, from 40% to 55% of trunk length. Secondary pectinate fringe formed as one fringed band near anterior segment margin is present on segments 2 to 10. For complete overview of measurements and dimensions of Portuguese and Spanish populations, see 
Table 3
. Distribution of cuticular structures, i.e., sensory spots, glandular cell outlets, spines and tubes, is summarized in 
Table 4
.
</p>
      <p>
The head consists of a retractable mouth cone and an introvert (
Figs 3
, 
4B
). Three rings of inner oral styles, apparently with five styles in each ring. The external mouth cone armature consists of nine outer oral styles, each consisting of two joined units and arranged as one style anterior to each introvert sector, except the middorsal sector 6; each outer oral style basally flanked by pair of lateral spikes, followed by more basal V-shaped row of fringe tips, and again followed by even more basal brush-like arch of bristles (
Fig. 4B
). The introvert sectors are defined by the ten primary spinoscalids in Ring 01 (
Fig. 3
). Each primary spinoscalid consists of a basal sheath and a distal end piece with a blunt tip. The sheaths have two distinctively differentiated fringes: a most basal, transverse fringe, and a slightly more distal fringe where the fringe tips bend in a curve near their attachment point, and fuse to the scalid along a longitudinal line, giving the attachment area a conspicuous appearance (see inset 
Fig. 4B
). End pieces are smooth and flexible. Rings 02 and 04 have 10 spinoscalids and Rings 03 and 05 have 20. All spinoscalids in these rings are well-developed, and consist of a basal sheath and a pointed end piece. The basal sheaths terminate into fine, fringed margins in spinoscalids of Rings 02 to 05, and those of Ring 03 have in addition a basal median spike (
Fig. 4B
inset). A ring of short fringes extend around the introvert in between spinoscalid Rings 05 and 06. Ring 06 has only six spinoscalids, located in sectors 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9; ring 06 spinoscalids resemble those in preceding sectors, but are much shorter and with densely haired end pieces. Ring 07 has 7 spinoscalids, located as pairs in sectors 3 and 9, unpaired but laterally displaced in sectors 5 and 7 (trichoscalids are taking up the space in the opposite side of each sector), and unpaired but centred in sector 1; ring 07 spinoscalids resemble those in preceding sector but are even shorter.
</p>
      <p>
Described sector-wise (
Fig. 3
), sector 1 has spinoscalids arranged as two double diamonds anterior to a single Ring 7 spinoscalid. Sectors 2, 4, 8 and 10 all have spinoscalids arranged as a quincunx, located in between a medial anterior spinoscalid (Ring 02) and a trichoscalid plate. Sectors 3 and 9 have spinoscalids forming double diamonds anterior to a pair of spinoscalids in Ring 7. Sectors 5 and 7 also have spinoscalids forming double diamonds, but anterior to an unpaired, lateral spinoscalid. Sector 6 has spinoscalids arranged as two double diamonds.

1, pachycycli, pectinate fringe of posterior margin and cuticular hairs as on preceding segment.
</p>
      <p>
Segment 7 with short acicular spines in middorsal (one specimen with two spines emerging from the same opening) and lateroventral positions (
Figs 2
D–E, 4F, H); middorsal spine does not reach the posterior margin of the segment, whereas lateroventral spines reach pectinate fringe. Females with female papillae as on segment 6, but with openings slightly more anterior and lateral to sensory spots (
Figs 2E

type
1, pachycycli, pectinate fringe of posterior margin and cuticular hairs as on preceding segment.
</p>
      <p>
Segment 8 with short acicular spines in middorsal and lateroventral positions (

Fig. 4G
). Minute glandular cell outlets 
type
2 present in laterodorsal positions, but very close to the midlateral lines (
Figs 2D, F
, 
4G
). Sensory spots present in paradorsal, subdorsal, and ventrolateral positions. Females with female papillae with same substructure as those on segment 7, but with openings more anterior and closer to midventral line. Glandular cell outlets 
type
1, pachycycli, pectinate fringe of posterior margin and cuticular hairs as on preceding segment.
</p>
      <p>
Segment 9 with acicular spines in lateroventral positions (
Fig. 4G
), just reaching the posterior margin of the segment. Sensory spots present in paradorsal, subdorsal, laterodorsal (posterior to glandular cell outlet 
type
2), and ventrolateral positions. Glandular cell outlets 
type
1 and 2 (
Figs 2F
, 
4G
) as on preceding segment, but female papillae not present. Paired nephridiopore areas each consists of a small, rounded sieve plate anterior to a single pore that we consider to be part of the nephridial system, present in lateral accessory positions (
Fig. 4G
, inset). Pectinate fringe of posterior segment margin with uniformly long fringe tips around the segment. Pachycycli and cuticular hairs as on preceding segment.
</p>
      <p>
Segment 10 with well-developed laterodorsal tubes near posterior segment margin (
Figs 2
G–H, 4I– J). Sensory spots present in subdorsal (but very close to paradorsal) positions; males furthermore with sensory spots in ventrolateral positions (
Fig. 4I
). Glandular cell outlets 
type
1 present as two longitudinally arranged middorsal ones and in ventromedial positions. The posterior segment margin of the tergal plate is straight, whereas margins of sternal plates are deeply concave (
Fig. 4K
); fringe tips of pectinate fringe are considerably shorter than those on preceding segments. Pachycycli and cuticular hairs as on preceding segment.
</p>
      <p>
Segment 11 with lateral terminal spines (

4
I–J); all three penile spines resemble each other, with thicker and rigid proximal parts that taper towards more flexible, distal tips; median penile spines slightly thicker than dorsal and ventral ones. Females with short, thin lateral terminal accessory spines (
Figs 2H

4K
). Sensory spots present in subdorsal and ventrolateral positions. Glandular cell outlets 
type
1 present as two longitudinally arranged middorsal ones. The dorsal and most of the ventral side of the segment are densely covered with non-bracteate hair-like extensions. Tergal extensions are well-spaced, short and pointed (

Figs 2H
, 
4I
