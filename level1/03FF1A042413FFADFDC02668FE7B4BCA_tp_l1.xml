The specific epithet honours Keooudone Souvannakhoummane (Centre for Development and Environment), a plant taxonomist who has greatly contributed to our understanding of plant diversity in 
Laos
through the description of many new species in various families for the flora of 
Laos

Preliminary conservation status
</p>
      <p>
We found three small sub-populations of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. souvannii
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
with each comprising only 5–6 individuals, about 
20 m
apart. The species has not yet been found anywhere else. Considering the species grows in a very narrowly restricted area where human activity, such as collection of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and the logging of wood for local uses, can be seen, we need to pay attention to its conservation. As the number of mature individuals is less than 50, we assess this species as Critical Endangered (CR) criteria D (
IUCN 2019
).
