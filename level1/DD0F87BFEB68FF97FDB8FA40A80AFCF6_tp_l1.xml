Affinities
</p>
      <p>
On the basis of the gonopod structure having the telopodite with a spine arising well distad of the knee, a ribbon-shaped distal part, and a small free solenomerite arising just near the apex, the new species is manifestly a new member of the large genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sechelleptus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Following the key published by Jeekel in 1999, 
<tp:taxon-name>
arborivagus
</tp:taxon-name>
keys out close to 
<tp:taxon-name>
sulcicollis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
macilentus
</tp:taxon-name>
. Indeed the three species have a rather simple gonocoxite with a distally widened metaplica without a strong lateral cone but the new species do not show the small lateral uncus present on the metaplica of 
sulcicolis
and possess a more or less spiniform mesapical projection on the proplica which is not present in 
sulcicolis
neither in 
<tp:taxon-name>
macilentus
</tp:taxon-name>
. By the overall shape of the male first leg and gonocoxite, the new species seems to be especially close to 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. variabilis
</tp:taxon-name>
, also from the 
Comoros
, but it differs strikingly by the structure of the gonotelopodite (in 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. variabilis
</tp:taxon-name>
the gonotelopodite has a simple and pointed tip carrying the terminal opening of the seminal groove whereas in the new species the gonotelopodite has a divided tip, the longer branch carrying the terminal opening of the seminal groove) as well as by the larger body size and the longer and curved claws (
Fig. 4K
vs 
Fig. 2C
). Other important differences concern the defensives glands, large in

(

) (vs inconspicuous in 
<tp:taxon-name>

(

<tp:taxon-name>
S. variabilis
</tp:taxon-name>
the eyes, smaller, include 34 ± 3 (n = 10) ommatidia arranged in 9 rows.

Natural history
</p>
      <p>
Most of the specimens belonging to the new species were collected on Mt Tchaourembo (see 
Fig. 8
) in a forest fragment at 
500–550 m
a.s.l. All specimens were seen in trees and never in pairs, the males being rare (sex ratio&gt; 
1/6
). The species possesses enlarged ommatidia, relatively long legs with strongly curved tarsal claws, as well as a tendency for specimens to secrete extremely copiously from their defensive glands when irritated. Such modifications are considered by several authors as an adaptation to tree climbing and to arboreal life (
Enghoff &amp; Enghoff 1976
; 
Hoffman &amp; Howell 1983
; 
VandenSpiegel 2001
).

Discussion
</p>
      <p>
Millipede systematics is mainly based on male gonopods because they use to be species-specific (

Bond 
et al
. 2003

). However, studies based on DNA have demonstrated that molecular divergence in different millipede groups may not reflect divergence in morphology-based identifications and may hide considerable variation (
Bond &amp; Sierwald 2002
; 

Bond 
et al
. 2003

; 

Adams 
et al
. 2009

; 

Mwabvu 
et al
. 2013

, 
2015
; 

Tinago 
et al
. 2017

). Although our relatively small taxon sampling, the phylogenetic analysis strongly recovers 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sechelleptus
</tp:taxon-name>
as monophyletic and discriminates at least two or three different groups. Furthermore, the mean inter-specific distance values (14.9% for COI and 5.1% for 16S) were remarkably similar to previous studies that reported the presence of high genetic divergence among population of different spirostreptid species (

Mwabvu 
et al
. 2013

, 
2015
), suggesting the existence of more than one species in those taxa. It is argued that high level of divergence between identified spirostreptid species may indicate that changes in genital morphology occur rather slowly relative to the high rate of substitution in mitochondrial sequences (especially for COI), and may underestimate species diversity. This also appears to be the case among the different forms of Mayottan 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sechelleptus
</tp:taxon-name>
, which also share strongly similar gonopods. At the first glance, the new species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sechelleptus
</tp:taxon-name>
seems to be a giant form of 

<tp:taxon-name>S. variabilis</tp:taxon-name>
.

However, although only subtle morphological differences are observed within the gonopods, the comparatively large body size and the behavior of 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. arborivagus
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
are remarkable. These observations finally corroborate our molecular analyses that clearly show sufficient genetic difference between the different 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sechelleptus
species
</tp:taxon-name>
collected on 
Mayotte
(22.6% for COI and 6.6% for 16S between 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. arborivagus
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. variabilis
</tp:taxon-name>
).

The genetic analyses also suggest the presence of another different species, i.e., DU1, although its phylogenetic position remains unresolved. This unique specimen found at Mont Combani is a sub-adult female that could not allow a formal identification, but, judging from its general appearance, appears to be an intermediate from between the two 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sechelleptus
species
</tp:taxon-name>
collected on 
Mayotte
. The genetic divergences, along with adaptations to arboreal life observed in the novel species, may indicate an “adaptive micro-radiation” on 
Mayotte Island
or even the 
Comoros
. However, the inclusion of more specimens, including adult males, in phylogenetic analyses is needed to test this hypothesis and evaluate the status of that putative new species.
