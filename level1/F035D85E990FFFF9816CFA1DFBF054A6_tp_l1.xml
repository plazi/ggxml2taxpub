long, thin and obtusely angled on one side. Pronotum: transverse, widest at posterior end, narrowest at anterior end, narrower than elytra; anterior margin convex, posterior margin trisinuate, lateral margin convex; surface covered with dense punctation, surface between punctures smooth and shiny. Scutellum: subtriangular, large, lateral sides gently convex. Elytra: longer than wide; anterior margin slightly convex, sinuate; anterior lateral angle nearly right angled, pointed; lateral margins strongly bordered; surface with mixtures of small fine sized punctuations and medium sized punctuations forming irregular near the elytral suture; elytral striae more clearly visible towards lateral end; surface between punctures smooth and shiny.

VENTER. Prosternum: concave on anterior margin, outer lateral margin concave; prosternal process as long as wide, lateral margin sinuated, posterior margin rounded. Mesoventrite: wider than long, narrowed towards posterior; anterior end concave where prosternal process fits, discrimen visible; laterally subparallel and gently curved, posteriorly flat, anteriorly trisinuate. Metaventrite: long and wide, flat on the middle; discrimen thin visible across each end. Abdomen: five clearly visible ventrites. Intercoxal process with pointed apex. Posterior margin of 1

LEGS. Tibia: protibia with outer and inner lateral margin curved. Meso- and metatibia with outer lateral margin almost straight, inner lateral margin straight. Tarsi: simple, segments increase in length towards the apex, 5

      <p>GENITALIA. Aedeagus: elongate, strongly sclerotised. Base: asymmetrical, widest around basal 0.2 from both lateral and ventral view. Median lobe: approximately ¼ length of genitalia; longer than parameres; gently curved on dorsal side, slightly bisinuate on ventral side, widest at middle, narrowing towards the apex, apex with round point in lateral view; apex pointed, split into two on anterior half and edge pointed, lower half of lateral end relatively straight in dorsal view; apical end smooth and narrows inwards in ventral view. Parameres: wider than median lobe in ventral view; apical emargination wide V-shaped, concave structure between parameres elongated and wide V-shaped, with gently pointed end; bisinuate, lower half of sinuation long and shallow, upper half short and slightly deep on dorsal side in lateral view; gently curved on ventral side in lateral view; apex pointed and overlaps with median lobe, majority of parameres overlaps with median lobe in lateral view.</p>
