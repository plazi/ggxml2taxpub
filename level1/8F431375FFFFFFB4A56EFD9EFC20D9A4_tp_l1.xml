This species may be separated from other

in eastern South America by means of the following combination of characters: large size; short sucker-like female gonopod (
Fig. 6E–F

Fig. 52E–F
); pedipalp patella with four dorsal spines and five ventral spines (

Description
</p>
      <p>
CARAPACE. Six anterior setae; frontal process triangular, with small apical projection (
Fig. 52C
). Small granules densely scattered between lateral eyes and among sulci. Median eyes well developed (
Fig. 52A, C
); median ocular tubercle weakly developed; pair of setae on median ocular tubercle; lateral eyes well developed, seta posterior to lateral ocular triad; lateral ocular triad well separated from carapace margin.
</p>
      <p>
STERNUM. Tritosternum projected anteriorly with typical setation, long, surpassing base of pedipalp coxae (
Fig. 52B
); other sternal platelets narrow and concave, with pair of setae anteriorly on plaque and some smaller setae posteriorly; pentasternum with fourteen setae anteriorly and four setae near membranous region.
</p>
      <p>OPISTHOSOMA. Ventral sacs and ventral sac cover absent.</p>
      <p>
GENITALIA. Female genital operculum with prominent setae posteromedially and some smaller setae near margin (
Fig. 6E–F
); gonopod sucker-like and slightly sclerotized basally (
Fig. 6E–F
); tubular projection without constriction (
Fig. 6E–F
).
</p>
      <p>CHELICERAE. Small flat tooth on retrolateral surface of basal segment, opposite to bifid tooth; retrolateral surface of cheliceral claw with continous row of setae, basally to medially; claw with nine teeth; row of eleven setae on prolateral surface of basal segment; bifid tooth on basal segment with dorsal cusp larger than ventral cusp.</p>
      <p>
PEDIPALPS. Coxal dorsal carina with two setae encircled by round carina and four setae on margin. Femur with five dorsal spines and five ventral spines (
Fig. 52E–F
); spine between dorsal spine 2 and 3 and spine 3 and 4; three prominent setiferous tubercles between dorsal spine 1 and proximal margin; spine between ventral spine 1 and proximal margin; spine between ventral spines 1 and 2, 2 or 3 and 3 and 4. Patella with four dorsal spines in primary series (
Fig. 52E–F
); prominent setiferous tubercle distal to spine I, one-third length of spine I; patella with five ventral spines; spine between spines 2 or 3 and 3 and 4; prominent setiferous tubercle between spine I and distal margin. Tibia with ventral spine distally and two setae between spine and distal margin. Tarsus with three dorsal spines, distal spine subequal to proximal spine (
Fig. 52D
); third spine situated proximally, near base of proximal spine; cleaning organ with 27–28 setae in ventral row.
</p>
      <p>
LEGS. Tibia of leg I with 23 articles, tarsus I with 41 articles; first tarsal article shorter than second article. Leg IV basitibia with four pseudo-articles, with sclerotized, denticulate margin projecting from apex of articles; trichobothrium 
bt
situated near midline of pseudo-article; distitibia trichobothrium 
bc
situated closer to 
sbf
than to 
bf
, 
sc
and 
sf
series each with six trichobothria.

Natural history
</p>
      <p>Specimens were found in the photic zone of a gneiss cave, near a small river. Specimens were only observed at night, on the roof and in crevices in the roof, of the cave.</p>
