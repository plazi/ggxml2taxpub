Revised diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
This genus can be recognized within 
<tp:taxon-name>Ectrichodiinae</tp:taxon-name>
by the following combination of characters: macropterous (male, based on 
<tp:taxon-name>
X. attractivus
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
) or micropterous (female); head club-shaped, subapically widened, distinctly longer than pronotum; ventral surface of anteocular part flat; antenniferous tubercle surrounded by lump-form process laterally; antennae four-segmented, with basiflagellomere shorter than other segments; labial segment II longest and dorsoventrally flattened, segment III inflated, segment IV flattened laterally; apex of prosternum acute, distinctly surpassing fore coxae; metathoracic gland evaporatorium invisible in lateral view; femora not thickened; apexes of tibiae bulbous; fossula spongiosa present on fore and mid tibiae; abdominal tergite II with three longitudinal ridges. In macropterous male, anterior pronotal lobe distinctly shorter but more than half as long as posterior lobe; scutellum broad, with 1+1 widely separated apical prongs and 1+1 lateral prongs; fore wing nearly reaching apex of abdomen. In micropterous female, anterior pronotal lobe distinctly longer than posterior lobe, swollen; scutellum broad, suberect or erect, with 1+1 widely separated apical prongs; fore wing not reaching apex of scutellum.

</p>
      <p>
ABDOMEN. Ovoid, with lateral outline rounded (

); segment VIII invisible at resting state (
Fig. 25
). Spiracles round.
</p>
      <p>
MALE GENITALIA. Pygophore (

Micropterous female
</p>
      <p>
COLORATION. Body generally brown to blackish brown (
Figs 1–3
, 
15–17
, 
46–48
, 
57–59
); tarsi, anterolateral and posterolateral angles of each connexival segment, apical margin of abdomen, spiracles and valvula I yellowish brown.
</p>
      <p>STRUCTURE. Body shape and vestiture similar to those in male, but differs in the following characteristics: body robust; antennal scape and basal half of pedicel bare; lateral margins of prosternum with suberect, short, golden setae; head thickened, 1.8–2.2 times as long as pronotum; eyes small; width between antenniferous tubercles broader than width across eyes; ocelli strongly reduced; anteclypeus not elevated; antennal scape distinctly shorter than head; pronotum nearly square; anterior pronotal lobe much longer than and as wide as or slightly narrower than posterior lobe, swollen dorsally; medial longitudinal sulcus of pronotum reduced to deep, medial depression; lateral margins of anterior pronotal lobe marginated; posterior margin of pronotum concave; prosternum much longer, reaching or surpassing anterior margins of mid coxae; scutellum suberect or erect, with prongs weakly developed; fossula spongiosa larger, occupying about apical 0.2 of ventral surface of fore and mid tibiae; fore wing not reaching apex of scutellum; abdomen broader, with ventral surface slightly flattened in middle.</p>
      <p>
FEMALE GENITALIA. Platelike (
Figs 10–11
, 
42–43
, 
55–56
, 
59
); tergite VIII transverse, anterior and posterior margins nearly straight; tergite IX large, trapezoidal, with transverse depression subapically; posteromedian margin of valvifer I slightly sinuate; valvula I small, triangular, with posterior margin slightly concave; styloid visible in resting state.
