Etymology
</p>
      <p>
The specific name is derived from the Latin ‘ 
flavus
’ (‘yellow’) and ‘ 
collum
’ (‘neck’), referring to its yellow pronotum.

Description
</p>
      <p>
Body length (both sexes): 
6.5‒9.7 mm
(
7.2 mm
in 
holotype
); width: 1.0‒2.0 mm (
1.7 mm
in 
holotype
).
</p>
      <p>
Male
(
Fig. 9C
)
</p>
      <p>COLORATION. Body black, clypeus, mouthparts, antennomeres I, prothorax, coxae and femora and posterior margins of abdominal ventrites yellow. Body densely covered with short, semi-recumbent yellow pubescence.</p>
      <p>HEAD. Subquadrate, surface densely and finely punctate, each side with a smooth and rectangular impression behind antennal socket; eyes moderately protruding, head width across eyes 1.5 times wider than pronotum; terminal maxillary palpomeres long-triangular, widest in middle; antennae filiform, roughly extending to ⅔ length of elytra, antennomeres II about 2.2 times as long as wide at apices, III about 1.6 times longer than II, IV‒XI each with a smooth longitudinal impression in middle of outer edge, VII longest, XI distinctly longer than X, XI slightly thickened, pointed at apex.</p>
      <p>PRONOTUM. Subquadrate, about 1.1 times as long as wide, anterior margin arcuate, anterior angles subrounded, lateral margins nearly parallel and slightly sinuate, posterior margin slightly sinuate and narrowly bordered, posterior angles sub-rectangular, disc strongly convex on posterolateral parts, surface finely and densely punctate.</p>
      <p>ELYTRA. Nearly parallel-sided, about 3.8 times as long as humeral width, 4.8 times longer than pronotum, surface finely and densely punctate, with hardly visible longitudinal costae.</p>
      <p>
AEDEAGUS (
Fig. 10D‒F
). Moderately swollen laterally at basal part, reduced apically in diameter; basal piece nearly as long as dorsal plate of each paramere, with a large, bifurcate conjoined middle nodule at base of ventral side; ventral processes of parameres approaching each other, short and slightly thickened apically, bent ventrally in lateral view; dorsal plates slightly longer than ventral processes, abruptly narrowed near base and approaching each other, apex acute and directed ventrally, lateroapical part with a ridge; apical parts of laterophyses depressed and separated from each other, apex acute and clearly exceeding middle emargination between dorsal plates.
</p>
      <p>
Female
</p>
      <p>Similar to male, but body stouter than male, eyes small, less protruding, head width across eyes 1.3 times wider than pronotum, antennae shorter and roughly extending to elytral mid-length, IV‒XI without smooth longitudinal impressions; elytra about 3.4 times as long as humeral width.</p>
      <p>
ABDOMINAL STERNITE VIII (
Fig. 7E
). Moderately narrowed posteriorly, lateroapical angles widely rounded, posterior margin widely and rectangularly emarginate in middle and feebly sinuate on both sides, behind the notch with a membrane which is sclerotized and triangularly bilobed at apex.
</p>
      <p>
INTERNAL ORGAN OF REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM (
Fig. 12C
). Vagina elongate, with median oviduct situated at ventroapical part, vagina abruptly narrowed in apical part and extended into a short duct which diverticulum and spermathecal duct are arising from; diverticulum extremely long, about 0.99 times adult body length, evenly thinned apically, slender tube-shaped and spiral; spermathecal duct slightly long but much shorter than diverticulum; spermatheca slender tube-shaped and spiral, obviously thinner than spermathecal duct and much longer than diverticulum, with basal part extended into a short tube, at opening of accessory gland.Accessory gland thin in basal part and remainder moderately thin, obviously shorter than spermatheca.
