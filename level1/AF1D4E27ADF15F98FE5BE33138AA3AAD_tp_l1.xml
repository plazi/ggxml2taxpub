      <p>MESOSOMA. Length 1.8 times its height. Pronotal carina distinct, distances from carina to both sides of pronotum subequal. Mesoscutum 0.9 times as long as wide. Notauli deep anteriorly and weakly shallow posteriorly, rather wide, crenulate with fine rugulosity. Prescutellar depression deep, very weakly and linearly oblique postero-laterally, with high median and two lateral carinae, almost smooth, 0.45 times as long as the convex scutellum. Sternaulus (precoxal furrow) distinctly and densely rugose-reticulate. Subalar depression sparsely and coarsely crenulate and with fine rugulosity between striae. Metanotum with short tooth directed backward. Metapleural lobe rather long, narrow, rounded apically, with relatively dense pubescence. Propodeum (lateral view) distinctly convex.</p>
      <p>WINGS. Fore wing 3.0 times its maximum width. Pterostigma 4.2 times as long as its maximum width. Metacarpus (1-R1) 1.2 times as long as pterostigma. Radial vein (r) arising from middle of pterostigma. First radial abscissa (r) forming obtuse angle with second abscissa (3-SR). Second radial abscissa (3- SR) 1.8 times as long as first abscissa (r), 0.3 times as long as the straight third abscissa (SR1), 0.8 times as long as first radiomedial vein (2-SR). Second radiomedial (submarginal) cell weakly narrowed distally, 2.7 times as long as wide, 1.5 times as long as the narrow brachial (subdiscal) cell. First medial abscissa (1-SR+M) almost straight. Recurrent vein (m-cu) 4.5 times as long as second medial abscissa (2-SR+M), 0.6 times as long as first radiomedial vein (2-SR). Mediocubital vein (M+CU1) almost straight. Nervulus (cu-a) postfurcal, distance between nervulus (cu-a) and basal (1-M) vein equal to nervulus (cu-a) length. Hind wing 5.4 times as long as wide. First abscissa of mediocubital vein (M+CU) 0.7 times as long as second abscissa (1-M). Recurrent vein (m-cu) antefurcal.</p>

      <p>LEGS. Hind coxa 1.5 times as long as wide (with basoventral tubercle). Hind femur 3.2 times as long as its maximum width. Hind tarsus 0.9 times as long as hind tibia. Second tarsal segment 0.45 times as long as basitarsus, almost as long as fifth segment (without pretarsus).</p>
      <p>METASOMA. Length 1.1 times as long as head and mesosoma combined. First tergite distinctly and almost linearly widened towards apex. Maximum width of first tergite 2.2 times its basal width; length 1.1 times apical width, 1.2 times length of propodeum. Second tergite with distinct shallow and transverse furrow in posterior third separating rather short transverse apical area. Length of second tergite 0.6 times its basal width, 1.7 times length of third tergite. Second suture rather deep, weakly curved and entirely crenulate. Fourth tergite enlarged, weakly convex in posterior margin, without median emargination and postero-ventral lobes, 1.5 times as long as third tergite, 1.7 times as long as fifth tergite. Ovipositor sheath 1.2 times as long as metasoma, about 2.0 times as long as mesosoma, 0.75 times as long as fore wing.</p>
      <p>SCULPTURE AND PUBESCENCE. Vertex distinctly and densely transverse striate, smooth laterally and posteriorly; frons finely transverse curvedly aciculate, partly smooth; face densely and distinctly obliquely striate, with very fine rugulosity between striae; temple smooth. Mesoscutum entirely densely granulate, median lobe additionally with small rugulosity, without rugosity along notauli, rugosereticulate in narrow area in its medio-posterior 0.3. Scutellum densely and rather finely granulate, granulate-coriaceous posteriorly. Mesopleuron widely reticulate-coriaceous. Metapleuron densely rugose-reticulate and partly with granulation. Basolateral areas of propodeum large, reticulate-rugulose, but finely coriaceous to almost smooth in their medio-anterior 0.3, with distinct median carina in basal 0.3 of propodeum; remainder of propodeum reticulate-rugose. Hind coxa densely rugose with striation partly in dorsal half, smooth in ventral half. Hind femur densely obliquely striate in dorsal half and smooth or almost smooth in lower half. First tergite entirely, second mostly (except smooth apical area), third and fourth tergite narrow laterally distinctly and densely longitudinally striate, with fine or very fine reticulation between striae. Remainder of tergites smooth. Vertex with very sparse, short and semierect pale setae, glabrous in medio-anterior part. Mesoscutum entirely with rather dense, short and semierect setae. Mesopleuron glabrous on wide median area. Hind tibia dorsally with short, rather dense and semi-erect pale setae; length of these setae 0.3–0.5 times maximum width of tibia.</p>
      <p>COLOUR. Body dark reddish brown, head paler ventrally, reddish brown to light reddish brown; third tergite of metasoma brownish yellow in transverse posterior half. Antenna dark brown to black, four basal segments yellow to brownish yellow. Palps yellow. Legs brownish yellow or light reddish brown, hind tibia pale basally. Ovipositor sheath black. Fore wing very faintly and evenly infuscate. Pterostigma brown, yellow in basal quarter and apically.</p>
