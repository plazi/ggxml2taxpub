Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
Differing from most species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dasya
</tp:taxon-name>
by its pronounced pseudodichotomous branching pattern (
Fig. 2A– C
), and from its most similar congener in habit, 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. crouaniana
J.Agardh
</tp:taxon-name>
, by its longer pseudolaterals, narrower and shorter tetrasporangial stichidia and axes fully covered with pseudolaterals to barely denuded proximal axes. The new taxon differs from all species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Dasya
</tp:taxon-name>
by its lack of post-sporangial cover cells.

Etymology
</p>
      <p>
The species is named after Dr Sylvia A. Earle, pioneering phycologist, scientist and open-water diver, 50 years after she led the first all-female team of aquanauts in Tektite II on the floor of the Caribbean Sea (

Earle 1972

Description
</p>
      <p>
Plants epilithic, erect to 
17 cm
tall, carmine red, arising from small discoidal holdfasts; indeterminate axes sympodially branched, appearing pseudodichotomously branched throughout, only slightly tapering from base to apex (
Fig. 2A–C
), 
0.3–0.8 mm
diam. in median to lower portions and completely corticated by rhizoidal downgrowth (
Fig. 2D
); indeterminate axes densely covered throughout with determinate, lightly pigmented, monosiphonous dichotomously branched axes (pseudolaterals; 
Fig. 2E
), except in some older plants in the most basal portions; pseudolaterals 
1.7–5.5 mm
in length, 25–91 cells from base to apex, irregularly dichotomously branched from the first to the seventh cell of the pseudolateral, upper portions unbranched and slightly tapering (
Fig. 2E
); basal cells of pseudolaterals initially globose to ellipsoid (
Fig. 2D
), 
21–37 µm
diam. and 
12–30 µm
long, then slightly elongating; suprabasal cells 
19–32 µm
diam. and 
8–32 µm
long, elongating more centrally, 9–22 um diam. and 
27–102 µm
long, and reaching greatest lengths distally, 
8–19 µm
diam. and 
32–127 µm
long; tetrasporangial stichidia single, borne terminally on 3–7-celled unbranched pseudolaterals (
Fig. 2F
) or terminating basal dichotomies of pseudolaterals (
Fig. 2G
), lanceolate to narrowly elliptical in outline (
Fig. 2F–G
), 
73–80 µm
diam. and 
269–305 µm
in length at maturity, composed of 10–12 fertile segments, acropetally producing then releasing sporangia (
Fig. 2F–G
); sporangia globose, 
21–29 µm
diam., tetrahedrally divided, 3–5 per fertile segment, sporangia borne on 2-celled whorled branches, post-sporangial cover cells lacking (
Fig. 2F
); one to two spermatangial stichidia terminating a basal dichotomy on 4–10-celled pedicels (pseudolaterals), narrowly elliptical to lanceolate in outline (
Fig. 2H
), 
46–69 µm
diam. and 
192–258 µm
in length at maturity; carpogonial branches and cystocarps unknown.
