Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>Shiny black with distinct yellow parts. Wing dimorphic: male stenopterous; wing with oval apex; stalklike process yellow to light brown; lobed apex with hyaline cells, veins and distal margin black; female stenopterous, stalk-like portion yellowish with minute lobed apex pale brown. Proboscis and antennae black; palpi yellow; postpedicel roundish, approximately as long as pedicel. Legs overall yellow only with the distal tarsomeres black. Abdomen black, tergites and sternites overall covered with setae; grey microtrichia present at last apical tergite and most sternites, resulting in shiny appearance of dorsal surface.</p>

sp. nov.
except for the following:
</p>
      <p>
Male
(previously undescribed)
</p>
      <p>
MEASUREMENTS. Body length: 
2.6–2.9 mm
(n = 5). Wing length: 
0.9–1.1 mm
(n = 5).
</p>
      <p>HEAD. Ocellar tubercle glabrous. Lateroclinate ocellars 2 times as long as postpedicel. Proclinate verticals 1.8 times as long as postpedicel.</p>
      <p>ANTENNA. Yellow. Postpedicel roundish, as long as wide and, approximately as long as pedicel; stylus almost 4 times as long as scape, pedicel and postpedicel combined.</p>
      <p>PALPUS. About 4 times as long as wide. Yellow in ground colour.</p>
      <p>THORAX. Postpronotal lobe, notopleuron, episternum, anepisternum, sternopleuron, katepimeron and meron weakly differentiated. Scutellum short, postscutellum longer and metanotum well developed. Prosternum and basal half of episternum densely covered by grey microtrichia. Postpronotal lobe bearing 7 setae laterally, 5 acrostichal setae, irregularly placed; notopleuron with 1 strong, prominent, very long seta, plus 3 smaller ones</p>
      <p>
WING (
Fig. 21B
). Lobed apex oval. Stalk-like portion rigid, yellow to light brown; lobed apex with hyaline cells, veins and distal margin black. Venation very reduced (costal, longitudinal and cross veins distinguishable), forming 4 cells.
</p>
      <p>
LEGS. Overall yellow, with the following brown to black: dorsal strip on fore and mid femora, posterior coxae, tarsomere 5 of fore and mid-legs, apical portions of tarsomeres 2 and 3, tarsomeres 4 and 5 of hind leg. Mid trochanter with several black anteroventral marginal setae. Mid femur with small roundish posteroventral projection on basal surface with several black denticle-like setae and ca 3 black setae. Mid tibia anteroventral apical spur produced into distinct, long elongation (
Fig. 19C
); slightly longer than diameter of tibia at apex. Spur covered with microtrichia and&gt; 10 short, blunt denticle-like setae; additionally, with 6 longer, stout, curved setae along lateral margin. Elongation mostly glabrous with a few setae arising marginally and apically.
</p>
      <p>ABDOMEN. Shiny black, with grey microtrichia covering only last tergite and almost all sternites, except for sternites 1 and 2. Tergites and sternites overall covered with setae, except for dorsal surface of all tergites and most of sternite 1 (distal margin with a few setae); apical sternite and tergite with longer setae.</p>
      <p>
TERMINALIA (
Fig. 12
). Right surstylus short with irregular margins, narrowing distally, bearing long setae, with several (ca 8) distinct denticle-like setae aggregated on distal margin. Right cercus longer than left. Right cercus with setae on apical ½; left cercus with setae of unequal lengths on apical half and 2 long apical setae. Left epandrial lamella ½ shorter than left cercus, with setae of similar length on apical half of ventral surface and on apex of dorsal margin. Left surstylus longer than right cercus, with very long setae on lateral and apical margins.
</p>
      <p>
Female
</p>
      <p>
Similar to male, except for following features: stenopterous (length of wing (n = 2): 
0.7–0.8 mm
), with very minute lobed apex, stalk-like portion yellowish with lobe light brown, covered by grey microtrichia (
Fig. 21C
); legs covered with regular rows of setae, with distinct circle of setae on fore femur and anteroapical setae on coxae; without other distinctive hairs or setae; spurs on mid tibia absent; cercus pale brown with grey microtrichia and setae.
