Description
</p>
      <p>
Colonies composed of a reticulate hydrorhiza growing on algae and a bryozoan, supporting erect, monosiphonic and mostly unbranched, occasionally branched once, hydrocauli (
Fig. 7C
). Stem regularly divided into internodes by straight nodes, each bearing a latero-distal apophysis and three nematothecae: two axillar, flanking the apophysis and one on the basal half on the opposite side. Apophyses alternately directed left and right and disposed almost in the same plane (
Fig. 8A
). Hydrocladia inserted on apophyses and composed of two internodes: one athecate basal and one thecate distal. Basal internode short, without nematothecae and with two internal perisarcal rings, one basal and the other distal. Thecate internode slightly longer than athecate, with one hydrotheca and three nematothecae: one mesial inferior and a pair of laterals (
Figs 7D
, 
8A
).
</p>
      <p>
Hydrotheca deep campanulate, adcauline wall fully adnate to internode, abcauline wall concave, margin straight, smooth and slightly flared. Mesial nematotheca long, reaching or even surpassing the middle of the abcauline wall of hydrotheca. Lateral nematothecae comparatively shorter and placed on small, yet distinct apophyses reaching the hydrothecal rim (
Fig. 7D
). All nematothecae two-chambered and movable; rim of upper chamber even throughout.
</p>
      <p>
Gonothecae arising frontally from apophyses of hydrocladia; large, barrel-shaped, smooth-walled, truncated apically; aperture wide and circular; operculum not observed (
Figs 7C
, 
8B–C
).

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
The validity of the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Monotheca
</tp:taxon-name>
or its synonymy with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Plumularia
Lamarck, 1816
</tp:taxon-name>
has been widely discussed during the last few years in the literature. 
Watson (2011)
and 
Calder (2019)
indicated that, despite the traditional interpretation of the genus, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Monotheca
</tp:taxon-name>
might involve a polyphyletic group. Indeed, some molecular analyses (

Leclère 
et al.
2007

, 
2009
; 

Moura 
et al.
2008

; 

Maronna 
et al.
2016

) revealed that the 
type
species of both genera, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Monotheca margaretta
Nutting, 1900
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Plumularia setacea
(
Linnaeus, 1758
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, respectively, did not cluster together. In addition, the latest molecular study of the superfamily 
<tp:taxon-name>
Plumularioidea (

Moura 
et al.
2018

)
</tp:taxon-name>
supports the validity of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Monotheca
</tp:taxon-name>
. Taking into account that the new species is closely allied to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. margaretta
</tp:taxon-name>
, we have decided to assign it to this genus, under the name 
<tp:taxon-name>
Monotheca bergstadi
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
</p>
      <p>
Our material is closely related to four nominal species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Monotheca
</tp:taxon-name>
, namely 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. margaretta
Nutting, 1900
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pulchella
(
Bale, 1882
)
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. flexuosa
(
Bale, 1894
)
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. femina
(
García, Aguirre &amp; González, 1978
)
</tp:taxon-name>
. The latter is currently accepted as a junior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. margaretta
</tp:taxon-name>
(Calder 1977; 

Ansín Agís 
et al.
2001

; 
Schuchert 2020
; as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Plumularia margaretta
</tp:taxon-name>
), and we agree.
</p>
      <p>
The remaining valid species are easily recognizable by the morphology of their gonothecae. In 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. margaretta
</tp:taxon-name>
, they are barrel-shaped, with well-developed transverse ridges and a broad, apical aperture (
Calder 1997
; 

Ansín Agís 
et al.
2001

); in 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pulchella
</tp:taxon-name>
the gonothecae are ovate, with an obliquely truncate aperture with a submarginal row of large, internal teeth surrounded by large, internal teeth (
Bale 1882
; 
Ralph 1961
; 
Watson 1973
, 
2011
); finally, in 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. flexuosa
</tp:taxon-name>
, the gonothecae are fusiform, with

</p>
      <p>
In addition, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. margaretta
</tp:taxon-name>
is an amphi-Atlantic species, whereas 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pulchella
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. flexuosa
</tp:taxon-name>
are predominately Indo-Pacific.
</p>
      <p>
Nevertheless, 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pulchella
</tp:taxon-name>
was reported several times from the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea (for a review, see 
Calder 1997
and 

Ansín Agís 
et al.
2001

), and the actual status of these records have been subjected to different interpretations in the literature. The records from the Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, all with annulated and barrel-shaped gonothecae, were included in 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. margaretta
</tp:taxon-name>
by 
Calder (1997)
and 

Ansín Agís 
et al.
(2001)

, and we agree with this conclusion, despite the fact that 
Watson (2011)
considers that they are conspecific with 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. flexuosa
</tp:taxon-name>
. The records of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pulchella
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Mediterranean (

Bouillon 
et al.
2004

) are based on the material studied by 

García Corrales 
et al.
(1978

, as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Plumularia femina
</tp:taxon-name>
) and 
Medel &amp; Vervoort (1995)
, and belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. margaretta
</tp:taxon-name>
, despite some figures (

Bouillon 
et al
. 2004

: fig. 92h, j) being based on Millard (1975: fig. 125c–d) and representing a different species (see below). The records of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pulchella
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Argentinian coast (
Blanco 1973
, 
1994
; 
Genzano 1990
, 
1994
; all as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Plumularia pulchela
</tp:taxon-name>
), were provisionally placed under 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. margaretta
</tp:taxon-name>
by 

Ansín Agís 
et al.
(2001)

because the involved colonies were sterile.
</p>
      <p>
The morphology of the colonies collected at the Vema Seamount studied in this report, with respect to their tropho- and gonosome, completely coincides with those described by Millard (1975) as 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pulchella
</tp:taxon-name>
from 
South Africa
and the Vema Seamount. This material, characterized by its barrel-shaped, smooth-walled gonothecae, is clearly distinct from the current concept of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pulchella
</tp:taxon-name>
, and also from other previously discussed species.
</p>
      <p>
In fact, 
Watson (2011)
excluded the South African records from the synonymy of 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. pulchella
</tp:taxon-name>
, but did not assign them to any known species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Monotheca
</tp:taxon-name>
. Consequently, we consider that this material represents a new species, for which we propose the name 
<tp:taxon-name>
M. bergstadi

South Africa

Millard 1957

(Millard 1975, as

).
