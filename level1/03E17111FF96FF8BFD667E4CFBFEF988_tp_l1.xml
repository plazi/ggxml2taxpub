Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
The new genus differs from other taxa of 
<tp:taxon-name>Selizini</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Madagascar
by the following characters: 1) wings subrectangular (wings strongly constricted apically in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Stenocyarda

</tp:taxon-name>
); 2) frons with median carina not diverged (frons with Y-shaped median carina in

Urana
</tp:taxon-name>
); 3) mesonotum without gibbosities (mesonotum with four gibbosities in

); 4) dorsal part of periandrium unilobate (dorsal part of periandrium bilobate in

Etymology
</p>
      <p>The generic name is an arbitrary combination of the name of the tribe ‘Selizini’, which the new genus belongs to, and the name of the forest formation – ‘tapia’, which the insect is associated with. Gender feminine.</p>

Antennae placed very close to medioventral margin of eyes; scapus small, ring-like, with single setae; pedicel shorter than diameter of eye but distinctly longer than scapus, bulbous, functional area at the top and on dorsal surface with trichoid sensilla

, 
2E
). Tegmina longer than wide, subrectangular, with distinct venation and numerous transverse veinlets in apical part, without nodal line and with single apical line; costal margin sinuate, costal and sutural angle rounded, apical margin slightly rounded, postclaval sutural margin straight. Costal area short, with dense transverse veinlets, ending at the level of fusion of claval veins (
Figs 1C
, 
3E–F
). Costal cell about the same width as costal area, tapering apicad. Basal cell longer than wide. Tegmen with longitudinal veins ScP+RA and RP arising as short common stem from basal cell before bulla. Vein ScP+RA with fork distinctly after RP fork, ending on costal margin with 4 terminals; vein RP with fork before MP fork, ending on costal margin with 8–9 terminals; vein MP with fork distinctly apicad to CuA fork, ending on apical and postclaval margins; CuA with the first fork distinctly before RP fork. Apical cells subrectangular. Veins of apical half of tegmen wrinkled. Sensory and wax gland-plates concentrated on bulla and costal area, with a few scattered on the whole tegmen (
Figs 1C
, 
3E–F
). Clavus ending a bit before the end of costal area; Pcu and A1 joined slightly anterior to clavus apex; A1 slightly elevated; sensory and wax gland-plates concentrated on the area between Pcu and A 
1
and basal part of the area after A 
1
vein; single transverse veinlet after Pcu-A 
1
connection (
Figs 1C
, 
3E
).

LEGS. Pro- and mesofemora slightly shorter than tibiae, subrectangular in cross section. Pro- and mesotibiae with shallow groove on external side; apical tarsomere of anterior and median legs longer than cumulative length of second and basal tarsomeres.
