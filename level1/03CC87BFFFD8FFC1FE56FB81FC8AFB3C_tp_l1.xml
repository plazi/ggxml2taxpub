Etymology
</p>
      <p>
From the Latin ‘ 
<tp:taxon-name>
corrugatus
</tp:taxon-name>
’, meaning ‘folded’, because of the corrugate sculpture.

      <p>shows rather densely spaced septa (18 per volution), but the last four are then strikingly crowded and indicate adulthood. The conch is extremely discoidal (ww/dm=0.20) and subevolute (uw/dm =0.43) with applanate flanks and a rounded venter. The sculpture consists of numerous densely spaced and sharp radial riblets (about 30 on half a volution in the adult stage), which on the body chamber extend with a shallow concave sinus across the flanks.</p>
      <p>
The suture line of the 
holotype
has a nearly parallel-sided, weakly pouched external lobe that is almost as deep as the adventive lobe; it has asymmetric prongs that are subdivided by two notches. The slightly asymmetric ventrolateral saddle is inverted U-shaped and followed by the asymmetric adventive lobe with five small notches, an asymmetric lateral saddle and an asymmetric lateral lobe with four notches (
Fig. 19C
).

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
The new species differs from the other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Shevyrevites
</tp:taxon-name>
by the much weaker sculpture, which consists of feeble riblets in contrast to the coarser ribs in 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. shevyrevi
</tp:taxon-name>
and the conical nodes in 
<tp:taxon-name>
S. nodosus
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
      <p>
Stratigraphic range
</p>
      <p>
Upper part of the Hambast Formation; float but probably 
4.80 m
below the extinction horizon (red nodular limestone in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Shevyrevites shevyrevi
Zone
</tp:taxon-name>
).
