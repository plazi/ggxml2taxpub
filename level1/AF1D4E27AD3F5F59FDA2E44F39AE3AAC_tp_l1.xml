Prescutellar depression with high median carina, sparsely and distinctly rugose, weakly curved along posterior margin, 0.3 times as long as scutellum. Scutellum almost as long as its maximum width. Subalar depression coarsely longitudinally striate. Sternaulus almost smooth. Prepectal carina below with very low lobes opposite fore coxae. Metanotum dorso-medially with two high and curved lateral and distinct median carinae (dorsal view). Propodeum weakly arcuately sloping backward (lateral view). Metapleural flange posteriorly with very dense white pubescence.</p>
      <p>WINGS. Length of fore wing 3.4 times its maximum width. Pterostigma 3.6 times as long as wide. Metacarpus (1-R1) 1.4 times as long as pterostigma. Radial (marginal) cell 3.5 times as long as wide. Radial vein (r) arising from middle of pterostigma. First radial abscissa (r) forming almost straight line with second abscissa (3-SR). Second radial abscissa (3-SR) 1.9 times as long as first abscissa (r), 0.45 times as long as the almost straight third abscissa (SR1), about as long as second radiomedial vein (rm). Second radiomedial (submarginal) cell medium size, very weakly widened apically, its length 2.8 times maximum width, 1.15 times length of the narrow brachial (subdiscal) cell. First medial abscissa (1-SR+M) distinctly sinuate. Second abscissa of medial vein (2-SR+M) short. Recurrent vein (m-cu) 0.85 times as long as first radiomedial vein (2-SR). Mediocubital vein (M+CU1) very weakly curved in apical half. Distance from nervulus (cu-a) to basal (1-M) vein 0.7 times nervulus (cu-a) length. Brachial (subdiscal) cell linearly closed distinctly behind recurrent vein; posterior bulla present but short; posterior abscissa of anal vein (2-1A) (behind brachial vein (CU1b)) present but short. Hind wing 4.7 times as long as wide. Recurrent vein (m-cu) weakly curved, oblique towards base of wing.</p>
      <p>LEGS. Hind coxa 1.4 times as long as wide (with tooth). Hind femur about 3.0 times as long as wide. Hind tarsus as long as the thick hind tibia. Hind basitarsus with distinct lower keel and with dense pale setosity. Second segment of hind tarsus 0.5 times as long as basitarsus, almost as long as fifth segment (without pretarsus).</p>
      <p>METASOMA. Length about as long as head and mesosoma combined, with sixth visible tergites, remaining segments almost not protruding behind sixth tergite. First tergite distinctly, almost linearly and evenly widened from base to apex. Maximum width of first tergite almost 2.0 times its minimum basal width; length of first tergite 0.8 times its apical width, 0.9 times length of propodeum. Basal area of second tergite 0.4 times as long as remaining tergite; apical area 0.6 times as long as remaining tergite. Median length of second tergite (with areas) 0.6 times its basal width, 1.4 times median length of third tergite. Posterior margin of sixth tergite weakly and widely emarginated medially, without postero-ventral lobes. Sixth tergite 1.1 times as long as fifth tergite, 1.4 times as long as fourth tergites. Ovipositor sheath 0.8 times as long as metasoma, 1.15 times as long as mesosoma, 0.55 times as long as fore wing.</p>
