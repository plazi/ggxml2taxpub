Diagnosis

      <p>
Differs from other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chassalia
</tp:taxon-name>
in Borneo in having large leaves up to 
48 cm
long and 
15 cm
wide (they are much smaller in other species), in the capitulum having outer and inner bracts up to 
1.5 cm
wide (broader than in any other species), in the infructescences usually persisting for a whole season until new inflorescences are produced (not soon disappearing after fruit maturity). Most similar to, but differing from, 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. calamus
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
in having bracts usually longer than the flower bud (not shorter), in having a longer peduncle, in having bigger leaves (to 48 × 
12 cm
, not to 33 × 
12 cm
) and more secondary veins (up to 26 on each side of the midrib, not &lt;18), and in having longer (
4–14 cm
, not &lt;
5 cm
) petioles.

Etymology
</p>
      <p>The epithet alludes to the involucrate bracts of rachis and capitulum, which are larger and more conspicuous than in other species of the genus in Borneo.</p>

0.4 mm
wide, 
0.4 mm
apart along their length, forming a longitudinal groove from apex to base between the two crests; ventral surface concave, central part slightly elevated, margin with an endocarpal outgrowth 
0.5–0.8 mm
wide, with a groove between the edge of endocarp and endocarpal outgrowth 
0.2 mm
wide. Raphal opening at base of the endocarpal outgrowth, round,
