Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
The general appearance of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oreodera kawasae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
is much as that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. turnbowi
McCarty, 2001
</tp:taxon-name>
. However, although 
McCarty (2001)
had only provided the length of the 
holotype
male and 
paratype
female, it is possible to see, using photographs of the 
holotype
(see 
Bezark 2021b
), that 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. turnbowi
</tp:taxon-name>
is proportionally more slender than 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. kawasae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
Additionally, comparing the males of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. kawasae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
with the 
holotype
male of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. turnbowi
</tp:taxon-name>
, it is possible to provide the following differences: distance between upper eye lobes equal to maximum width of the scape; antennomeres VII and IX not ringed with white pubescence basally; anterolateral tubercles of the prothorax with apex noticeably rounded; elytra at most 4.0 times prothoracic length; centrobasal crest of the elytra not distinctly separated into two tubercles; tarsomeres V shorter and distinctly widened. In the 
holotype
male of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. turnbowi
</tp:taxon-name>
, distance between upper eye lobes shorter than maximum width of scape, antennomeres VII and IX distinctly ringed with whitish pubescence basally, anterolateral tubercles of the prothorax nearly conical, elytra is almost 4.5 times prothoracic length, centrobasal crest of the elytra distinctly separated into two distinct tubercles (with punctures between them), and the tarsomeres V are longer and slender. According to 
McCarty (2001)
, the mesoventral process in 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. turnbowi
</tp:taxon-name>
is 1.25 times as wide as the mesocoxal cavity. As we do not know where the width was measured (narrowest area or apex), we are not using this difference (in 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. kawasae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
, 1.3 times in the narrowest area, 1.5 times in apex).
</p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Oreodera kawasae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
is also similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. noguerai
McCarty, 2001
</tp:taxon-name>
, but differs by some of the same characters attributed to 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. turnbowi
</tp:taxon-name>
(body proportions, pubescence on antennomeres VII and IX. Unfortunately, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. noguerai
</tp:taxon-name>
is known only from the 
holotype
female, while 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. kawasae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
is known only from males, but it also differs by the antennomere III being about 0.7 times as long as scape (twice as long as scape in 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. noguerai
</tp:taxon-name>
), and apical half of elytral margin without a fringe of sparse, fine, erect setae (present in 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. noguerai
</tp:taxon-name>
).
</p>
      <p>
The general appearance of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. kawasae
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
is somewhat similar to that of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. advena
Martins &amp; 
Galileo, 2005
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. basipenicillata
Tippmann, 1960
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. undulata
Bates, 1861
</tp:taxon-name>
, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. clarkei
Galileo, Santos-Silva &amp; Wappes, 2017
</tp:taxon-name>
(see photographs of these four species on 
Bezark 2021b
), but differs from them especially by the elytral pubescence pattern, and protarsal length and shape.

Etymology
</p>
      <p>
This species is named after Blanca Jeannette Kawas Fernández (Jeanette Kawas for short) in honor of her never-ending efforts to conserve the fauna and flora of 
Honduras
. She co-established the Prolansate Foundation, which is still committed to protecting the environment while improving the quality of life of the local communities. Jeanette was murdered at her home in 
February 1995
.

Variation
(
Figs 18–19

</p>
      <p>Pubescence on vertex moderately greenish-brown; dense yellow pubescence on scutellum from covering almost entire surface to present only at apex; elytral pubescence somewhat variable, especially shape of white pubescent bands, and number of brownish subcircular areas, which may be very distinct, almost forming oblique band close to arms of Y-shaped white pubescent band, and posterior area of central white pubescent band.</p>

Sequence information

      <p>
A specimen from CNP of this species has been sequenced by the 
Centre
for Biodiversity Genomics (CBG) as part of a separate project (
D’Souza &amp; Hebert 2018
, project doi: https://doi.org/10.5883/DS-MECNP), but until now it has remained unidentified. The sequence (Cytochrome Oxidase Subunit 1 5’ Region) can be accessed through the BOLDSystems database, with ID number GMHGE319-13.

      <p>Apparently, the new species is somewhat common. Therefore, it is likely that there are many specimens incorrectly identified in the collections.</p>
