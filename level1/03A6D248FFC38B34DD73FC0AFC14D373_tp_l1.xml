Description
</p>
      <p>
Color and morphology of live animals
(
Figs 54–55A
)
</p>
      <p>
Live animals are not usually covered with mud, and their natural color is visible without washing. The dorsal notum is brown to dark brown or black, often mottled with two colors. The notum bears small elongated (longitudinal) ridges. The ventral color varies but the hyponotum is yellow, beige or yellow-orange, with distinct darker spots of variable size (small to large) and color (faintly tan to black). When those spots are large and dark enough, the hyponotum appears nearly black (which was most common in the Strait of 
Malacca
). The hyponotum of juvenile specimens can be marked by fewer spots. In 
Malaysia
, 
Singapore
and 
Brunei
, the edge of the hyponotum commonly is orange, which was also occasionally observed in other populations. The foot is distinctively orange. Papillae with dorsal eyes are present. Their exact number is variable (generally between 20 and 65). Each papilla bears one dorsal eye. Eyes are distributed across the notum and many eyes are found at the margin (i.e., eyes can be &lt;
2 mm
from the notum edge).

Radulae measure up to

      <p>
Reproductive system
(
Figs 55
D–F, 57)
</p>
      <p>
In the posterior part of the reproductive system, the oviduct is wider than the deferent duct (approximately up to twice as wide). Its distal section (distal to the spermatheca) is approximately up to twice as long as its proximal section. The deferent duct is longer than the oviduct, not attached to it, and highly coiled with tight, long, U-shaped loops. However, the deferent duct tends to be shorter in 
Malaysia
and 
Northern Territory
(
Australia
), and considerably longer in 
Brunei
and the 
Philippines
. The female pore is very close to the anus, between 
0.5 mm
and 
2.5 mm
apart. The distal, flexible region of the penis with hooks is approximately 
2 to 2.5 mm
long and approximately 
170 µm
wide. Penial hooks are relatively large, approximately 
35 to 55 µm
long (
Fig. 57B
), and can be seen inside the semi-transparent penis or when the penis is evaginated like the finger of a glove in the vestibule (
Fig. 57A
). The posterior retractor muscle of the penis inserts on the right side, within the third (posterior) quarter of the visceral cavity. The length of the retractor muscle varies from half the length of the penial sheath to slightly longer than the penial sheath. The deferent duct is highly convoluted (but is less convoluted in juvenile specimens).

by professor von Martens. However, von 
Martens (1897: 128)
later wrote that “ 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis martensi
Plate
</tp:taxon-name>
was not found by me at 
Singapore
, but at Petshaburi in the Gulf of 
Siam
,” which is in the north of the Gulf of 
Thailand
. The label of the 
holotype
at the Berlin Museum now reads “ 
Siam
, Petehabardi” (presumably a misspelling). 
Hoffmann (1928: 89)
considered Petshaburi to be the type locality and even specified “ 
Singapore
, Plate, ex errore, nach 
Martens 1897
.” Also, note that the specific name appears as “ 
<tp:taxon-name>
martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
” in the text and in one figure caption (
Plate 1893: 196
, pl. 7, fig. 23a) but as “ 
martensii
” in the two other figure captions (
Plate 1893
: pl. 7, fig. 7, pl. 10, fig. 50).

The posterior (female) reproductive system in the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
is largely destroyed. The hermaphroditic gland is in pieces and disconnected from the hermaphroditic duct. A large part of the female gland mass is separated from the oviduct and the deferent duct. However, the long and convoluted deferent duct is intact and is only consistent with the species described here. 
Plate (1893: 197)
also described the color of the live animal (based on field notes from von Martens) as having an intense yellow hyponotum with black marbling as well as a light gray-brown foot. A yellow hyponotum is only found in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. aptei
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
The color of the foot is the external trait which can distinguish these two species, and Plate’s description of “light gray-brown” is a closer match to the bright orange foot of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
than the dark black foot of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. aptei
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
The number of dorsal eyes he described (90) is higher than what we have observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
, but we could not check this as the dorsal eyes have lost their pigment. 
Plate’s (1893: 197)
description of the dorsal eyes that “sit alone on the big warts” is consistent with this species, but his comment that “this rule does not apply without exception, because on about 12 warts there are 2 eye spots, so that one can speak in these cases of a group” is surprising. We have found no evidence that dorsal eyes occur in groups of two in this species; Plate’s statement that dorsal eyes occurred in pairs suggests that his count of dorsal eyes is likely an overestimate.

Plate’s (1893: 198–199)
original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex inspectabilis
</tp:taxon-name>
from an island in southern 
Myanmar
, in the Andaman Sea, mentioned the diagnostic characters of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
. Plate indicated intestinal loops of type II, but this could not be verified because the intestine of the 
holotype
was previously dissected. Plate’s original description indicates a black-blue hyponotum (the color of the 
holotype
has faded over time and could not be verified). Fresh specimens were not available from 
Myanmar
, but many specimens were observed with a nearly solid black hyponotum (due to a high density of black spots) along the north-western coast of peninsular 
Malaysia
. Despite a slight difference in the description of the hyponotum color, it can be determined that the 
holotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. inspectabilis
</tp:taxon-name>
belongs to the species described here due to the remains of its female (posterior) reproductive system. The length of the deferent duct adjacent to the oviduct is long and convoluted with elongated loops, which is indistinguishable from 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
(the deferent duct is similar in length in specimens of a similar size from Peninsular 
Malaysia
). The length of the distal portion of the penis with hooks in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. inspectabilis
</tp:taxon-name>
(
2 mm
) also fits exactly the size range observed in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
(
2–2.5 mm
). So, for all the reasons above, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. inspectabilis
</tp:taxon-name>
is considered here to be a junior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
.

Semper’s (1882) original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
was based on 
syntypes
that are part of at least two species (see our remarks on 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex coriaceus coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
). One 
paralectotype
of 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. coriaceum
</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Penang
belongs to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
. Indeed, its posterior (female) reproductive system is not compatible with 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. tigrinus
</tp:taxon-name>
or 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. luteus
</tp:taxon-name>
, but displays the diagnostic feature of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
(the wide, long, highly-convoluted deferent duct adjacent to the oviduct). In addition, Semper rightly noted that dorsal eyes are present across the notum including on its margin, and dorsal eyes very close to the notum edge (&lt;
2 mm
) are only found in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. aptei

recently re-described a species they identified as

Platevindex mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
based on specimens from 
Hong Kong
, but 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. mortoni
</tp:taxon-name>
is considered here a nomen dubium and their description is based on specimens that belong to at least two different species. One individual illustrated with a bright orange foot (

<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi

Plate (1893: 196–199)
did not comment on the very close similarity between 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex inspectabilis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
in his original descriptions, but he compared 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. inspectabilis
</tp:taxon-name>
to 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. semperi
</tp:taxon-name>
, from the 
Philippines
(
Plate 1893: 199
). This may be due to a similarity in their hyponotum color; the preserved hyponota of both 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. inspectabilis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
O. semperi
</tp:taxon-name>
were described by Plate as dark blue (though, now, decades later, the hyponotum is creamish in the 
type
specimens of both species). However, 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. inspectabilis
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. semperi
</tp:taxon-name>
are not regarded as synonyms because 
Plate’s (1893: 193)
description of the copulatory apparatus of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. semperi
</tp:taxon-name>
indicates that it is a junior synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. coriaceus
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex inspectabilis
</tp:taxon-name>
was also proposed as a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Oncis stuxbergi
</tp:taxon-name>
by 
Hoffmann (1928: 88)
and 
Labbé (1934: 235)
, but 
<tp:taxon-name>
Vaginulus stuxbergi
Westerlund, 1883
</tp:taxon-name>
actually belongs to the genus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Onchidium

We collected 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
in 
Northern Territory
, 
Australia
, but did not find it in 
Queensland
, 
Australia
, though it cannot be excluded that we missed it there. An online photo (viewed at https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/14094815 on 
30 Jul. 2018
) from Maroochy, Mooloolaba, 
Queensland
, shows a 
<tp:taxon-name>
Platevindex
</tp:taxon-name>
slug with elongated dorsal ridges similar to those found in 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. aptei
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
Also, its description mentions that it is an “orange footed mangrove onch slug.” Because no photograph of the ventral surface is available, the identification of that slug cannot be confirmed. Until this geographic record is confirmed by the examination of actual specimens, 
Queensland
is not considered part of the geographic distribution for 
<tp:taxon-name>
P. martensi
</tp:taxon-name>
.
