      <p> Diagnosis </p>
      <p> This species may be separated from other <tp:taxon-name> Charinus </tp:taxon-name> in
         eastern South America by means of the following combination of characters: anterior margin
         of carapace slightly extended with eight prominent setae; lateral eyes reduced to an
         eyespot; female gonopods sucker-like, length similar to width, opening rounded, margins
         with small folds and pronounced bottleneck below them; cheliceral claw with 8–10 teeth;
         pedipalp femur with four or five dorsal spines and four or five ventral spines; pedipalp
         patella with five or six dorsal spines and three or four ventral spines; pedipalp tarsus
         with three dorsal spines; tibia of leg I with 23 articles, tarsus I with 41 articles; leg
         IV basitibia with four pseudo-articles; sc and sf series each with six trichobothria. </p>

      <p> Natural history </p>
      <p> Fazenda Jurema Cave is relatively small (ca 100 m long) and belongs to the Una limestone
         group, located in the Caatinga biome, the only semi-arid biome in Brazil . Specimens were
         collected mainly in the terminal part of the cave, where the phreatic level is visible.
         Vasconcelos &amp; Ferreira (2016) noted that despite surveying other caves in the area,
         specimens of <tp:taxon-name> C. caatingae </tp:taxon-name> were only collected in the
         Fazenda Jurema Cave, suggesting that the species may be endemic to this cave. Potential
         prey includes crickets ( <tp:taxon-name> Endecous sp. </tp:taxon-name> ) and moths (
            <tp:taxon-name>Tineidae Latreille, 1810</tp:taxon-name> ). The vegetation outside the
         cave was partially removed for corn and manioc crops; additionally, an electric pump was
         installed inside the cave to pump water for crop irrigation. Due to alterations of the
         natural environment inside and outside the cave, the species is considered to be severely
         threatened ( Vasconcelos &amp; Ferreira 2016 ). </p>
