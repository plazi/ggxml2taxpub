Description
(
Figs 3–4
)
</p>
      <p>HEAD. Head not depressed, high, transverse. Ocelli arranged almost in equilateral triangle. Frons not concave, without median keel or furrow. Eyes glabrous. Occipital carina complete dorsally, joined ventrally below with hypostomal carina. Malar suture fine. Clypeal suture distinct and complete. Clypeus with short ventral flange. Hypoclypeal depression medium-sized, round. Postgenal bridge narrow. Palps long; maxillary palps 6-segmented, its fifth segment longest, 1.4 times as long as sixth (apical) segment; labial palps 4-segmented, its third segment not shortened. Scapus wide and short, without apical lobe and basal constriction; its ventral margin (lateral view) not longer than dorsal margin. First flagellar segment subcylindrical, almost straight, weakly longer than second segment.</p>
      <p>MESOSOMA. Mesosoma not depressed and relatively long. Neck of prothorax short. Pronotum dorsally almost flat, with distinct submedian pronotal carina. Pronope absent. Propleural dorsoposterior flange rather short and not wide. Mesonotum high, gently and roundly elevated above pronotum, mainly smooth. Median lobe of mesonotum with median longitudinal furrow in posterior half, without anterolateral corner. Notauli entirely deep and complete. Tegula short, widened distally, weakly convex along its posterior margin. Prescutellar depression deep, long, with several carinae. Lateral longitudinal winglike flanges situated on level of prescutellar depression low. Scuto-scutellar suture rather distinct and complete. Scutellum weakly convex, without lateral carinae. Metanotum with short, but distinct and pointed median tooth posteriorly. Mesopleural pit deep, subround, connected with mesopleural suture. Sternaulus (precoxal sulcus) rather deep, not wide, long, running along whole length of lower part of mesopleuron, almost straight, smooth. Prepectal carina distinct and complete, high below opposite coxae, laterally following up till subalar furrow. Postpectal carina absent. Metapleural flange rather long, wide, round apically. Propodeum with distinctly delineated by carinae basolateral areas and areola; lateral tubercles and propodeal bridge absent. Propodeal spiracles small and round.</p>
      <p>WINGS. Pterostigma of fore wing wide. Radial vein (r) arising almost from middle of pterostigma. Radial (marginal) cell not shortened. Both radiomedial veins (2-SR, r-m) present. Second radiomedial (submarginal) cell long and narrow. Recurrent vein (m-cu) weakly postfurcal. Discoidal (discal) cell petiolate anteriorly, petiole (1-SR) rather long. Nervulus (cu-a) postfurcal. Brachial (subdiscal) cell gently and almost linearly closed apically before recurrent vein (m-cu). Parallel vein (CU1a) interstitial. Transverse anal veins (2A, a) absent. Hind wing with three hamuli. First abscissa of costal vein (C+SC+R) 0.4 times as long as second abscissa (1-SC+R). Radial vein (SR) arising from costal vein (2-SC+R) not far separating from basal vein (1r-m). Radial (marginal) cell subparallel-sided, without transverse vein (r). Medial (basal) cell distinctly widened towards apex, about 9.0 times as long as its wide, 0.45 times as long as hind wing. Nervellus (cu-a) present. Submedial (subbasal) cell short. First abscissa of mediocubital vein (M+CU) 0.5–0.6 times as long as second abscissa (1-M). Recurrent vein (m-cu) short, antefurcal, strongly oblique towards base of wing, unclerotised.</p>
      <p>LEGS. Fore and middle tibiae with dense short and thick spines arranged almost in single row. Fore tarsus 1.5 times as long as fore tibia. Middle tarsal segments rather short. Hind coxa rather long and wide, with distinct basoventral corner and tubercle. All femora with more or less distinct dorsal protuberances. Hind tibia with spine with single row of dense white setae in inner distal margin. Hind femur wide. Inner spur of hind tibia rather long, glabrous, but with row of setae on basal half, 0.2 times as long as hind basitarsus; outer spur short, about 0.5 times as long as inner spur. Hind basitarsus about 0.9 times as long as second–fifth segments combined. Claws short and simple.</p>
      <p>METASOMA. Widened from base till end of fore tergite, then rather evenly narrowed to apex, with six visible tergites, but seventh tergite also weakly protruding behind sixth tergite. First metasomal tergite not petiolate, wide, immovably fused with second tergite in both sexes. Acrosternite of first segment about 0.2 times as long as first tergite, its apical margin placed distinctly before spiracles. Dorsope of first tergite small but distinct; present short and wide basolateral lobes; spiracular tubercles indistinct, spiracles placed in basal third of tergite; dorsal carinae complete and parallel. Second suture deep, regularly curved, without lateral bends. Second tergite with short semi-oval basal area, with long lenticular apical area delineated by deep concave furrow. Third tergite without transverse depression or furrow. Second–sixth tergites with separate laterotergites. Sixth tergite of female not enlarged, without transformations, not or only weakly longer than previous tergite, not entirely covered following apical segments. Hypopygium small, pointed medioposteriorly. Ovipositor almost as long as metasoma. Apical part of ovipositor with two small dorsal nodes and serrate ventrally.</p>

Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
This genus is very similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bathycentor
Saussure, 1892
</tp:taxon-name>
but differs from it mainly immovably fused first and second metasomal tergites in both sexes (vs not fused), the interstitial position of parallel vein (CU1a) in fore wing (vs not interstitial) and postfurcal position of recurrent vein (m-cu) (vs antefurcal).
