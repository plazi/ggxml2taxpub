In both mtg trees, this poorly supported monophyletic or paraphyletic family contains two strongly supported monophyla and one monotypic taxon which we rank as subfamilies: 
<tp:taxon-name>Euphyllurinae</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>Liviinae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Neophyllurinae</tp:taxon-name>
subfam. nov.
There is no strong support for any particular sister group relationship, although in a backbone constraint analysis in 

Percy 
et al
. (2018)

, 
<tp:taxon-name>Neophyllurinae</tp:taxon-name>
subfam. nov.
grouped more strongly with 
<tp:taxon-name>Liviinae</tp:taxon-name>
than 
<tp:taxon-name>
Euphyllurinae 
Crawford, 1914
</tp:taxon-name>
. The family as defined here differs from that of 
Burckhardt &amp; Ouvrard (2012)
in that it lacks the 
<tp:taxon-name>Diaphorinini</tp:taxon-name>
(minus 
<tp:taxon-name>
Megadicrania
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Psyllopsis
</tp:taxon-name>
, which are included here in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Euphyllurinae</tp:taxon-name>
). Adults of 
<tp:taxon-name>Liviidae</tp:taxon-name>
often have a crown of densely spaced apical spurs and immatures have multiple lanceolate or sectasetae.
