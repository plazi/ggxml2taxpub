from

, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. vandersandei
(Horst, 1924)
</tp:taxon-name>
from

. These eight species share proximal region of the dorsal ligules of similar size across the body (or slightly enlarged in posterior parapodia), absence of notopodial prechaetal, neuropodial postchaetal and superior lobes and subacicular homogomph spinigers, areas VII–VIII with one well-defined band of fewer than 20 paragnaths, area III with less than 20 paragnaths, and the area I with no more than two paragnaths (see 
Villalobos-Guerrero &amp; Idris 2021
: table 2). Additionally, they are all similar as they possess a pear-shaped prostomium and ovoid palpophores.
</p>
      <p>
Nonetheless, 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. galetae
</tp:taxon-name>
is easily distinguishable from them all by the following diagnostic features: (I) rounded patch of 9–11 paragnaths on area VI, in contrast to transverse row of up to four paragnaths in 
<tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>

, one paragnath in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. mexicana
</tp:taxon-name>
, and none in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. hondoensis
</tp:taxon-name>
; (II) the paired eyes of similar size, in contrast to the anterior pair markedly larger than the posterior pair in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. mexicana
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. papillosa
</tp:taxon-name>
; (III) the ventral ligule welldeveloped throughout, in contrast to that markedly reduced in posterior parapodia of 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. dawydovi
</tp:taxon-name>
; (IV) the dorsum of all segments with transverse pigmentations, in comparison to its absence in chaetiger 
2 in
<tp:taxon-name>
N. dawydovi
</tp:taxon-name>
; and (V) dorsal cirri with regular size, in contrast to it being markedly elongated on parapodia 
6 in
<tp:taxon-name>
N. egregicirrata
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
      <p>
Likewise, 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. galetae
</tp:taxon-name>
can also be differentiated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. vandersandei
</tp:taxon-name>
in the following features based on its recent redescription (
Villalobos-Guerrero &amp; Idris 2021
): (I) the multi-articulated tentacular cirri, in contrast to those smooth in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. vandersandei
</tp:taxon-name>
; (II) the presence of merged paragnaths on area IV, in comparison to its absence in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. vandersandei
</tp:taxon-name>
; (III) the presence of paired oesophageal caeca, in contrast to its absence in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. vandersandei
</tp:taxon-name>
; (IV) the presence of heterogomph spinigers in a few anterior supracicular neurochaetae, in comparison to its absence throughout in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. vandersandei
</tp:taxon-name>
; and (V) the blade of heterogomph falcigers with incurved terminal tooth and distinct tendon in middle and posterior parapodia, in contrast to those with blunt terminal tooth and inconspicuous tendon throughout in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. vandersandei
</tp:taxon-name>
.
</p>
      <p>
The species was described by 
Fauchald (1977)
using 
eight immature
specimens collected from the 
Panama
side of the Caribbean Sea among red algae, although only six of those collected in the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Acanthophora
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Laurencia
</tp:taxon-name>
zones correspond to the type series. At present, only 
four types
remain (
holotype
and 
three paratypes
). The type material examined here partially matches the barely-illustrated original description, which was seemingly based on the 
holotype
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Neanthes galetae
</tp:taxon-name>
was described with a higher number of paragnaths in the areas of the maxillary ring (I: 2; II: 20; III: 18; IV: 25) when compared with specimens from the type series (I: 0–1; II: 8–14; III: 5–12; IV: 11–17). The dorsal cirri were mentioned as attached basally throughout in the original description, although it is attached medially in the middle and posterior parapodia of the type series. The replacement of homogomph spinigers by heterogomph spinigers in supracicular neurochaetae of posteriormost parapodia stated in the description was not observed in the type material. However, the heterogomph spinigers were observed in a few anteriormost parapodia, which were replaced by heterogomph falcigers in the following parapodia.
</p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Neanthes galetae
</tp:taxon-name>
was not characterised or redescribed previously until this study. The original description includes a short, implicit comparison with four taxa of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Neanthes
</tp:taxon-name>
in having a few paragnaths on area VII–VIII: 
<tp:taxon-name>
Neanthes agulhana
(Day, 1963)
</tp:taxon-name>
from 
South Africa
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. dawydovi
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. kerguelensis
(Mclntosh, 1885)
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Kerguelen Islands, and 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. kerguelensis oligodonta
(Augener, 1913)
</tp:taxon-name>
from 
Australia
. They were distinguished by paragnaths occurring on area I, although variations overlap in the species (see 
Villalobos-Guerrero &amp; Idris 2021
; this study). The subspecies is not considered valid presently (
Wilson 1984
), and the differences with 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. dawydovi
</tp:taxon-name>
were mentioned above. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Neanthes galetae
</tp:taxon-name>
is easily distinguished from both 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. agulhana
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. kerguelensis
</tp:taxon-name>
by the lack of notopodial prechaetal lobe (present in those species) and the rounded patch of 9–11 paragnaths on area VI (transverse row of up to 4 paragnaths in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. agulhana
</tp:taxon-name>
and 0–1 paragnath in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. kerguelensis
</tp:taxon-name>
). 
<tp:taxon-name>
Neanthes galetae
</tp:taxon-name>
is also different from 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. kerguelensis
</tp:taxon-name>
by the lack of neuropodial postchaetal lobe and subacicular homogomph spinigers (both present in 
<tp:taxon-name>
N. kerguelensis
</tp:taxon-name>
).
</p>
      <p>
The species has also been recorded from the Pacific part of 
El Salvador
(

Planas 
et al.
2013

) and 
Colombia
(

Jaime 
et al.
1999

) in ecological studies. However, they are considered doubtful until a re-examination of the voucher material is performed.
