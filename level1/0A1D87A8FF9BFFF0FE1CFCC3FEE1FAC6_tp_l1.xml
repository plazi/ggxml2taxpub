Dragan Antić has called our attention to the strange case of “ 
<tp:taxon-name>
Protoserbosoma tuberculata
Makarov, Mitić &amp; Tomić, 2005
</tp:taxon-name>
” which was recorded from Prekonoška Cave in a faunal list for caves and cavities in the northwestern part of the Svrljiške Mountains, East 
Serbia
(

Nešić 
et al.
2007

). However, a genus and species of this name has never been described, and both names are obviously nomina nuda. Prekonoška Cave is the 
type
locality for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Perunosoma trojanicum
</tp:taxon-name>
, and the nomen nudum almost certainly refers to this species.
